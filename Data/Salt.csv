4.0,I went there for dinner on Christmas eve with my team and we all loved the atmosphere of this place. We were a group of 10 with both vegetarian and non vegetarian and I must say no one had any complain regarding the variety or quality of the food
3.0,"Unfortunately I had more expectations from this.. the starters which was surf turf which was not that great, mutton Rogan Ghosh was just two Bigg pieces of mutton but well cooked.. the drink peached ice tea was very nice and the strawberry mint milk shake was good.. the person who was servicing us was not the best and took some time even to give the bill.. overall a good place will visit another time so sure. .India breads are very costly..will give 3.5/5"
5.0,Awsome service &ambience. Great place to be I. For dinner.Must say service is top in town and taste too good.  Would come back again.keep the great work
4.0,"We visit this place quite often as we love the food and the service. Some of our favorites are the nalli nihqri with roti, paneer Tikka, and the gajar halwa roll pretty much steals the show every single time, and is a must have. They also have a good bar menu and a wide variety of beers as well."
3.0,Loved the food. Loved the ambience. Service was good and courteous prompt staff. Clean and Hygienic. Loved the Galauti Kebab and Gulab jamun tiramisu. Mutton Rogan Josh was good. Butter naans were soft and nice. Mixed fruit cocktail was not that fresh though.  Family friendly.
3.0,"Really pretty place to bring your family here. Price on the higher side but you could use your zomato gold. The food is okay, ordered butter chicken, biryani and malai kofta and few naan. More on the sweeter side. The staff there are very patient. They recommended the atta chicken, will go there again and review it. Thanks for a good experience  Note: My friend asked me where I'm going, I told him ""The salt"", he was like you get uppu at home. I told him its going to be an expaansive uppu. So go there when your pockets are full"
5.0,"Went there for early lunch. We were served complimentary mocktails and some fryums. For starters we had galouti kabab and adraki mutton pasliyan... Main course we order butter naan, Mutton Dum Biryani and Raara mutton curry . Service was slow we had to wait long time for the galaouti kababs and Biryani. I guess we were too early   Food: 5* Ambience :4* Service:4*"
5.0,"Food - Delicious Service - Very pleasing Space - Though inside a mall, there is enough seating for 70-80 pax Price - That's why I like Zomato Gold:)  Must try: Prawn Koliwada - Medium sized prawns sauted in a tangy sause and lots of curry leaves Khas methi murgi - soft boneless chicken in methi tomato gravy. Perfect with hot tandoori roti  WI'll try Atta Murg the next time"
4.0,"If you need a calm and serene place with good Indian food after a tiring shopping day at the mall, u go to this amazing place SALT @VR mall whitefield. It has got a calm n soothing vibe as soon as you walk in and if it complimented with some live acoustic singing there's nothing more you can ask for. Food couldn't be better. Topped in taste, presentation, quantity and hygiene. They've got some options in drinks as well. The staff was most kind and even the manager greeted us and asked for feedback. Happy place happy tummies."
4.0,"Ambience - 5 Food - 4.5 Service- 4 Value for money - 4.5  Loved the dahi kebab, alloo palak chat, Peshawari Malai paneer tikka, corn and cheese balls, creme brulee. Awesome taste and worth the price. Cant wait to go back. If you plan to go there choose Friday Evenung as the band that performed there is simply too good"
1.0,Food 0.5 Ambience 3 Service 4.5  Worst food I have had outside. Neither the starters or the main course could satisfy anyone. We had to order food after coming home. The place is good for couples or families. The place is sofasticated. Food not at all recommended. The place just couldn't justify the prices. Not bachelor friendly.
4.0,"We went for a team outing and that ended with having dinner at Salt. We went for buffet dinner which was fairly priced but I must admit that every penny worth it.  Starters were freshly prepared and served in a persuasive manner, service was great. Non-vegetarian starters was finger licking, specially chicken and mutton starters. Prawns and fish were also descent, I didn't like much but my colleagues loved it. Panner was soft and tender and obviously well cooked.  We didn't have much space to try out all the main courses, tried small bit of all the preparations, it was good but not out of the world experience.  Dessert is good, didn't have much options though, but still well prepared and tasty.  Only thing bad I want to mention here is the cocktails, saying horrible would be generous.  Overall experience is good, nice ambience, good service, good coverage in menu."
4.0,"Quaint place on top floor of VR mall which serves excellent Punjabi food. USPs of the place are a) High end, not too crowded and enough space to carry your kids and let them be free b) Mind-blowing desserts : Their saffron cheese cake and tiramisu with jamuns are worth every penny c) Non greasy punjabi gravies. Keeps your stomach happy at the end. d) Frequent food festivals - one such ""rotis of india"" and ""Holi menu"" was fantastic  At the same time, we find the veg. menu quite small (Indian starters & main course) and few trips are enough to try out everything. While we love this place, repeat value is exponentially reducing for want of choices - hope there are better options for veg dinners."
2.0,One of the most over rated restaurants in the city. I had a great opinion about the place untill I had my dinner there. We ordered a Salt speciality starter Surf & Truf. With high expectations we we're waiting but the food was not less than a disaster. With vermeceli upma type in the middle and prawn and fish pakoda. Quality and quality both were not good. Coctails were also not worth. Then coming to main course Alleppy fish curry was the worst among the lot. It was no were near the Alleppy curry. The only thing I fond tolerable was Murg tikha masala in the main course. Spoiled our mood I didn't had the courage to order deset. Very disappointing experience. The best thing about the place is it's ambience and seating.
4.0,"SALT  Indian Restaurant Bar & Grill  is located on the 3rd Floor of VR mall. There's some excellent choice of eateries here in Toscano, Maziga and Irish House but SALT with its food, decor and value has its own draw.  The place is elegantly done up. The glass facades and brick walls are common place these days but what i like most were the mounted black boards and the versatile use they've been put to. The boards not only advertise SALT and their specials, but also play canvas to some chalk art. The use of yellow highlights the bar area without being jarring to the senses.The mosaic floor and the olive upholstery complement the overall theme.  The staff here were quick to provide a table and fill our glasses with water. A complimentary basket of finger chips (papad) was placed on our table. We were very hungry and quickly ordered Adraki Mutton pasliyan and the Galouti Kabab for starters. The dishes took a while and we kept emptying out the finger chips basket as we waited :) . The first sight of food was to be had only after a couple of apologies from the staff for the delay in preparation.  The lamb mince Galouti Kabab were outstanding. Served on saffron breads, these were consumed at the rate of knots. The mutton pasliyan paled only in comparison but were a decent dish nonetheless.  Food 4.5/5  Service 4/5  Ambiance 4/5  Slobbering Genie's Verdict : 4.2/5 - There's a lot more on the menu that holds a lot of appeal. Hope to be back for round 2."
4.0,"Salt is a family dine-in place, also for corporate dinners and lunch. It's mainly for North Indian food lovers. Me being a not a big fan of North Indian food, I loved its taste. Less spicy and good quantity.  Recommended for North Indian Food"

5.0,"Classic North Indian restaurant with a unique taste for each and every dish. We underestimated the portion sizes and ended ordering a lot. But was totally worth it and will definitely go back. Would recommend the Chettinad Mushroom, Rarha Mutton Curry and their signature Chicken Tikka. Once again, thanks to Zomato Gold"
2.0,Really bad service and very very loud live music which completely takes away from the ambiance. The food was also not exceptional mediocre and sweet at best.   Will never be visiting this place again.
5.0,"Visited here with family, its decor and ambience is perfect for a family kinda fine dine. The seating is comfortable and the staffs are very welcoming. The food quality is really good. Mutton Roganjosh and Chicken Patiyala were too good, and even the parathas were perfect. They even celebrated my sister's birthday with a cake from their side.  Must visit for authentic North Indian food."
4.0,"After reading some really good reviews, I really thought of exploring this place. The ambience is quite inviting and the staff has definitely pleasing and courteous behavior. Now for the food, we ordered Koliwada prawns in starters, and Rahra Mutton Curry and Kulcha for mains. They also serve complimentary fryums with chutney. As refreshment, I took one Mint lemonade as Kala Khatta was not available. The prawns were delectably piquant. The mutton was soft and tender but somehow I felt the taste could have been a bit better. It felt a little flat on tastebuds. Overall it was a nice experience as we could really feel the warmth of the staff while they serve you. Hope to try out something new and different next time we visit."
4.0,This one is a best restaurant if you want to have indian food. They have variety and also have bar. One must try there kala khatta mocktail. It was amazing and very different. We had tandoori chicken and chicken starter here. Food was 4/5. Try to grab a seat outdoor if you want to have food with a view.
4.0,"We went here for the Women's day lunch from office.The buffet had a nice spread. The welcome drink had a nice cool masala aam panna with sweet and spicy flavour. There are lots of mocktails and cocktails to choose from:like fresh juices,berrylicious,khus khus,fruit blends.I personally felt that the sweetness can be reduced a little. Soup:With chunks of chicken and tinge of black pepper served nice and hot. Salads including chaats that were nicely done. Assorted veggie starter like potato in honey sauce,paneer,veg and corn tikkis. Assorted non veg starters including chicken kebabs and fish tikkas.  The Main course had steamed rice,paneerbutter masala,2 types of chicken gravy,fish gravy,served with freshly baked tawa rotis and nans,yummilicious chicken biryani.  The desserts had shrikhand,brownie with vanilla icecream and gulab jamun. The desserts were served in shots which was a nice delight after the meal. Overall taste was good.Staffs are courteous and the service is good. It's a good place for team lunches."
4.0,"Situated in VR MALL Bengaluru, this is nice place to have quiet family dinner. The ambience is nice dim light setting with open air seating options too. Staff is polite and prompt. Food is tasty but servings are small, place is understandably expensive because of service and location."
5.0,Visited Salt with my Mom and Husband on 2017 June. Quite a luxurious ambiance with great food. Basically this is a perfect example of fine dining.  All the tables had separate lights and also table was arranged very neatly.  The cost is slightly on the higher side however it is worth the cost. Do not miss their dessert. The sixth star goes to their presentation of food.
4.0,"Nice food, really warm service. Do try the Prawn Koliwada & the Tariwala mutton. Their naans are good too. Ambience is very nice, they close in the afternoon so check the timings before planning to go."
4.0,"Excellent ragda pattis and dal makhni. Best in town. Also great service by Mr. Pramit, assisting us with the order and recommendations.  One of the most consistently great North Indian restaurants in Whitefield."
4.0,A perfect place to wine and dine with your family. The atmosphere is very good. No complaints on the food. The food was good but it wasn't good enough to be highlighted. Kudos to their staffs for a great customer service. My actual rating would be 3.7
4.0,"So finally I visited Salt. Almost 1 year since I thinking to go there and now it happens. I would say I like the place. I would need to visit it few more times to have better view. Probably the best way is going in a group. You get to taste lots of things..  Pros: I like the staff, they were polite, cordial. Ambience was decent and warm. I tried veg sizzler and it was good.(would love to try non veg next time). Mocktails were decent and nice.  Cons: I visited with only 1 friend. So didn't get much to taste. Our little tummy was full. I'll have to try it more to say something. Will visit agian."
3.0,"My husband wanted to have Biryani so I chose this place coz the reviews were fantastic. Being from North India and having eaten one of the best galouti kebabs, I wouldn't recommend theirs. We ordered chicken Biryani, kulfi for dessert and a few drinks. The kulfi was nice, Biryani was ok. But their ambience and behaviour of staff is really nice. Pramit's hospitality was commendable, and he made sure we were comfortable. I will surely come back again to try other things on their menu. Maybe that wasn't a very good day."
4.0,"#latereview  On a weekend lunch date, we were heading towards one of our loved joints, The Irish House. But the aroma of the tandoored dishes pulled us towards this place, that we thought of trying it out for a change.  On entering, we found the ambience and decor having vibes of a family fine dining joints. We were greeted by our server and we were seated in a comfortable area inside. One can also opt to sit outside, in open air.  The menu is quite extensive, and on special occasions and festivities, they have specials too. We opted to try the Salt Chicken Tikka for starters and Murgh Makhani for main course.  The taste, overall, was good. We found the Salt Chicken Tikka very good while the Murgh Makhani was disappointing and it could have been much better.  Overall, based on taste, ambience, value for money, this place can be given somewhere between 4 and 4.5 out of 5.  Would definitely recommend this place and would try this place again."
4.0,"Hi. Went for the LBB Dessert Bazaar on Saturday to VR and decided to have lunch at Salt.  Ordered: Chicken Lollipops Zaffrani malai murg  Cheese balls Atta chicken special Rice Lacchha parathas  Chicken ghee roast  All food items were pretty decent. Nothing really to complain about. Atta chicken was nice, but can be better.   Pics coming up soon :)"
5.0,"Good place to have Indian good after a round of shopping in Phoenix / VR Starters are delicious and filling, so never got a chance to order main course. Galouti kebab are a must try; soft and juicy; one of the best I have had so far in Bangalore. Paneer silsila and mutton Tawa fry is also good, Kerala chicken roast can be avoided."
4.0,Nice restuarant Tried:- Salts chicken tikka Surf and turf - except battered fish everything else was fine. Surprisingly no SALT in fish. Chicken biriyani Chiken chennai style curry Romali roti.  Overall rating 4/5. Nice staffs.
3.0,"Locating & Parking are easy. Parking comes for a premium since it is located in VR.  What's Good Options in the menu.  How's Food In one word - Good. Tasted Ghee Roasted Prawns, Mutton Keema Vada & Dum Biriyani. Pick of the lot was Prawns- Soft, Tasty & just right amount of ghee. Keema Vada was OK. The biriyani preparation is a little different from Dum Biriyani and the taste is good though. All the items were good but nothing like out of the world experience.  What's not so good Nothing noteworthy.  Bottom Line - Decent Outing."
4.0,"Courteous staff, quick service, good menu options and tasty food . Tucked quietly on higher floor bit away from the din of mall. Price list does seem a bit dearer on pocket for food as well as drinks, but quality made up for it. Sufficient space even for groups."
4.0,This is a nice place the food is very sumptuous and the ambience is cozy.The staff is very polite and welcoming.Fisha tikka and chicken Biryani are my favourite s
5.0,"I absolutely adore this place. If you happen to be in VR or Phoenix, ditch the food court and try Salt. Everything about this restaurant is beyond words. I came here for an early lunch a couple of months back. Luckily we got through without any waiting but I would highly recommend making reservations before coming here.  The ambiance here is chic and vibrant. The interiors are beautifully decorated. There's also the option of outdoor sitting.  Coming to the food  Starters  The Salt's Chicken tikka : Must try This melt in your mouth beautifully marinated chicken is just out of the world. Served with lacha salad and mint chutney this is a feast for the senses.  Murg Makhani: This mildly spicy dish was creamy and rich. The char grilled chicken tikka was just yum.  Coming to the drinks  Berrylicious and Khala khatta These super summery tangy and refreshing drinks were indeed delicious.  To sum up, I had an amazing dining experience. We also got a great deal with Zomato gold.  Salt is definitely my new go to place in VR. Do check it out if you happen to be in the neighborhood."
4.0,"Have been to Salt in VR mall...Daal makhani is awesome , a must try. Rest all food was good but nothing special. Overall good place - 1 time visit sure.  Its a fine dining place and kids friendly."
5.0,Had an amazing experience at Salt ..  Must try Kaala Khatta mocktail.. its a spicy tangy tasty mocktail which does create a lasting taste ..   We were attended by Aditya who did explain about the food and the drinks in an amazing way.. He was welcoming courteous!!!   Thank you Aditya and Salt team for giving amazing dining experience!!
5.0,Such a nice place with awesome food quality. They have few outside sitting as well. Interior is bit luxurious. Food quality is really nice. Dont forget to try salt special chicken tikka. Paneer tikka was also so yummy. We tried kala khata mocktail. It was a nice Choice no doubt. Very friendly staffs they have. One staff named Durga served us and I must say so friendly person he is. We forgot to claim zomato gold initially. While we asked for bill he only asked us about zomato gold and we got good offer. Overall it was a very good experience at Salt.
4.0,"One of great Indian food restaurant I have been. Must try non- veg ghee roast prawns , chicken Tikka and stuffed naan. Also they have amazing mocktails to offer. Must try summer fruit mocktail. If you want to try spicy masala chicken starter than go for aata chicken."
4.0,"We decided to spend the last weekend before Christmas shopping at VR Mall and had made a booking at the Salt for lunch at 15:30 hrs. Arriving a few minutes early, the restaurant was packed and we had to wait for our table. The short wait of about 15 minutes was tough, as we were tired and hungry and the aroma of the food was not helping either.  We used the waiting period to decide on our order but the order was changed by the service crew Surojit, who was waiting at our table. He recommended the Atta Chicken, where a full baby chicken was cooked with a mix of greens and covered with dough and baked. This is a large portion and can fill your appetite. We enjoyed our Rajma Galouti kabab that we ordered along with it. For our main course, we stuck to a chicken biryani as we wanted to indulge in the desserts. We ordered the Filter coffee Crme Brulee with was just awesome. The Elaneer payasam was recommended and was good.   The service was extremely efficient, staff polite and attentive despite us sitting through a change in shift. Great job by Aditya and Surojit.   Definitely recommend the Atta Murg, Rajma Galouti and the filter coffee Crme Brulee.   Would like to be back soon to try the Nalli Roganjosh."
4.0,Food 4/5 Ambiance 3.8/5 Service 3.5/5 Cleanliness 4/5  Not a deal breaker. The food is good. But there is slight room for improvisation. Service is nice. Looking forward to visit again.
5.0,"Food: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Hygiene & Cleanliness: 5/5 Value for Money: 3.5/5  Been to this place a couple of times. This place always brings smile on my face. They are proper north indian restaurant with mouth watering dishes. Though they are bit pricey but once you eat them, they are worth every penny. Service is amazing here. Servers are friendly and are aware of the menu and can guide you which dishes would be best. Definitely one of my favourite places."
5.0,My first visit here was really disappointing but the second one changed it all. Everything from starters to desserts was lip smacking. We started with aloo tikki chat and dahi ke kabab.. the kabab would just melt in your mouth. Then we had palak kofta makhani and olive naan which were both new for us. Kala khatta mocktail would be a different experience altogether.  Taste - 4.5/5 Ambience/ Service - 4.5/5 Value for money - 4/5
4.0,"Visited this place for lunch. The ambience is decent with a few seating arrangement outside also. While our food order was getting ready, they served complimentary fryums . For starters we ordered Chef's signature dish Dahi ke kebab, golden fried hung yogurt. Tried something like this for first time, and must say, the dish was yummuylicious. For main course order Murg Makhani n Paneer butter masala along with rotis n naans , though nothing extraordinary but both decent dish. The quantity of the both was good. The cocktails Mojito n Margarita were OK too. Service was good . Table booking is recommended, especially on weekends."
4.0,"Went for a buffet lunch with office folks. The place is on the expensive side. They have three options for buffet with the variety dropping with the price, the best one being for 995. The variety that you get for that price is not justified, worse if you are a vegetarian. Food taste is good. Mutton curry was amazing. Service was fine with buffet being served on the table. Not sure if the desserts are also limited in quantity as we werent asked if we wanted to repeat. Overall a good place to visit if someone else is paying."
4.0,"Location - 3rd floor on the VR mall, so you can chill here post your shopping spree  Ambience- there are two parts to the restaurant, one is the outdoor seating which is very cosy and perfect for some conversation with a view of upcoming metro construction. The inside seating is more for large groups and families as they have bigger tables  Food and Drinks  Spicy Chettinad Mushrooms - The vegetarian cousin of Chettinad Chicken - true to its name - spicy and perfectly paired with some beer  Indo Chinese Chicken Lollypops - When nornal chicken lollipops meet Chinese sauce - soft yet crunchy outer shell  Plain Naan and Bira blonde - usual in taste and texture  Service and Price -Service is nice. However it is a little expensive but with Zomato Gold it can be a great experience"
4.0,Went to this place with my colleagues. The ambience was good enough. The food was good. It felt slightly hot inside the restaurant. The dessert was very well presented.
5.0,I have to rate it 5 stars...amazing people and amazing food...I still wonder why I missed out this place when I have visited VR mall so many times...galouti kebab was awesome and the chicken biryani is also worth mentioning...located in 3rd floor of VR mall the ambience is super cool...next time would try their outdoor seating..
