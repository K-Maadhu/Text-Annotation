4.0,"Abmience goes with the name of the restaurants . Staffs are friendly and courteous. Initially the starters served were very spices on our taste bud but the staffs ensured to provide food as per our likings . We went late but the staffs were never in hurry to shut the restaurants or place the last order . Would like to recommend they to have white sauce pasta ,kids like it."

4.0,"The ambience of the place is amazing. The food spread lacked variety and was okay. Liked the desserts, especially jamun. Prices are reasonable and can surely visit the place once."
5.0,"This is one of my favourite places to binge on , the food is lip smacking good especially the starters and rabdi and jaledi is a must try. A good place with peaceful ambience to hang out with close aquaintaces"
5.0,Santosh was extremely courteous and professional. The service was prompt and mindful to youre taste buds. Overall a good evening spent with the family
5.0,Place is really good.Service is superb....we had mutton Rogan curry...that one is really delicious.will definitely visit this place again. Thanks to Raju and bisu Jamal.
3.0,Ambience is quite amazing and suits the theme of sultan and sultante. The food is average specially the starters but main course isnt bad. Variety is limited and sweets spread is also quite less. The taste of jalebi and gulab jamun is quite nice. I would say taste is quite good and Zomato gold 2 plus 2 drinks made the experience better.  Not bad but not so great like the rating of 4.5 on Zomato and I would rate smwhere between 3 to 3.5 and max 4.
5.0,"Finally been to Sultans of Spice ...its a great experience to be there...  Ambience 5/5  One of the place I like most what I've been so far... especially the painting on the wall..  Service 4/5 It's a Sunday lunch...the place is full... may be because of that the service is little slow... and I feel that less staff... But the staff is courteous....specially thanks to mzi, Santosh, and Jamal for the nice mocktail..  Food 4/5  Like to give 5 star but mushroom is little salty apart of that all is good.. Specially love kalmi kabab from the starter.. You have around 60 items to eat. Must try their chats... thats up to the mark..  Drinks 4/5 Try their in house special like seven wonders of the world ..thats amazing...  Overall it's a very nice place to dine..lunch their is buffet dinner you will get Ala carte that you can get special afghan Delhi and North Indian food... Recommended to everyone...."
3.0,"We went for the buffet. Have been here couple of times now. Friendly staff. They try to make sure that your visit is more of an experience. We had an anniversary celebration once and they took a picture of the group and gifted us a hard copy. They even gifted us with flowers. Lovely surprise. But food's taste is average. They try filling you with lots of starters as the options in main course are only a few. Some dishes taste well, like the mushrooms, fish and prawns. The other dishes were remade by the chef when we gave feedback on the dishes we didn't like much. So that way, the staff is lovely. But the food still tastes only average. I would have liked all the dishes to taste well right upfront, not having the need to be remade."
5.0,"A must visit place for a perfect ambience and awesome food. Really welcoming staff. Being a chicken lover, it was a great experience. Do try murg taftaan."
4.0,"As the same suggests it's mainly north Indian food. Spicy level of all items were moderate nothing too spicy. Few things which standout for me were service, few starters like crispy corn, chicken kebab, mushrooms and paneer Tikka. Main course was ok and wide spread on desserts and live counter which was worth waiting. Few starters like baby corn, rajma kebab and pineapple grills wasn't that great. However post feedback chef took care of all items. Drinks were vibrant and amazing in taste this is from there special drinks menu not from regular one."
5.0,Wow it was a good place where we had a ossm taste of food and friendly natured pepl... If any one r finding for the good food surly u can move on to sultans of spice
5.0,"Amazing Experience. Friendly behviour of the staff. Nice Ambience, Tasty food. Must visit place for dinner. Murgh Musalam Biryani is a must try dish."

Starters served very yum and they were happy to serve us enough . They had special dishes ready to prepare and serve on demand . After that we were guided to main course table Had nice veg and non veg dishes !

Thank You Sultan of Spice team for serving us good food and taking care of us well . Appreciate your service . Thank You on behalf of me and our team !
4.0,"Very good decor and setup. The staff is extremely warm and are on their toes to help. The food is very palatable, especially their malai kebabs and Khameeri roti. Overall presentation is decent.  The way finger bowl is served is marvelous and goes to show how attention to little details has been given. The icing on the cake was the complimentary pan shots."
5.0,Very delicious food. The service was also extremely hospitable. Mr Jay Shankar was the go to man at the store. Enjoyed the entire dining experience to the core
5.0,"Food is mouth savouring and creamy. The staff is especially polite and service is fast. A good place to fine dine in a quiet place. Easily got a place here on a Saturday night for 3 members. Ordered a mixture of veg and non-veg delicacies and both were delicious. I highly recommend this place for good food, good ambience, fine dining and awesome service"
5.0,"Went there on a Tuesday night. The place is as the name says, Sultans or spice. The complete theme of the restaurant is a Royal one and they match the food and ambience with their hospitality.  Ordered the following.  DPA paneer tikka. (4/5) It was a platter of 3 type of paneer, 2 pc of each. Paneer was very soft, tasted well.  Murg Angaar tikka(4/5) Perfectly cooked chicken with fantastic flavour.  Paneer tikka achaari(4/5) Expected the gravy to be a bit more spicy, but tasted good none the less.  Murg Makhani(5/5) A must have!  Daal sultani(5/5) A must have!  Breads: Butter naan, garlic naan, aalu kulcha, garlic cheese naan(on request)  All breads were good, aalu kulcha was average.  Ratings: Hospitality- 5/5 Ambience- 4.5/5 Food- 4.5/5  Overall: 4.5/5  Would recommend the place:)"
1.0,Very worst restaurants. Food is not good. Very bad service. Also water leakages from wall near my table. I recommend never go this restaurant.
4.0,An awesome fine dining place in koramangala..with a delicious mughlai spread in their menu..tried tandoori chicken and murg biriyani.. loved it absolutely..not too heavy with the right proportion of spices..they have a buffet spread too with sumptuous options too.. extremely courteous staff good service..you gotta visit this place once if you love mughlai food
5.0,"One of the best places to go for authentic Indian & Mughlai food! I love the flavors at Sultans and the staff named Amaresh is really friendly and helpful. I like the fact that the food is absolutely authentic and healthy (not submerged in loads and loads of oil like other places). You won't be disappointed, and your stomach will be happy.  Each dish is seasoned with it's own spices and herbs which come out smelling savory and appetizing, unlike other places that use the same seasoning for all dishes.  The chicken wings are one of my favourites.  The wings are seasoned with a spicy seasoning and done just right with rum, with the skin a bit crispy and the meat juicy which makes for a heavenly delight. The presentation and the flavour of Sultani Tandoori Murg just stand out from the rest.  This place is spiced just right.  A place to visit again for sure!!"
5.0,It has been one of the best dining experiences in recent times. The taste was great and one thing to keep in mind is the hospitality offered by staffs which made my experience complete. Special call out for Amaresh and his team who went out of the way to ensure our experience was great. Chicken wings with rum was a stand out dish and I hope they include more such innovative dishes in the menu in future. Wish this restaurant great luck. Keep it up !
5.0,"Awesome service by the people here. Especially, Jayashankar did a great job and went one step over to personalize our requirement.  We came here on an ad-hoc basis, but we will come back sure."
5.0,Ambiance is quite good and food is really tasty and fresh. Restaurant guys were really polite and the behaviour shown by them was quite impressive.
4.0,"Good ambience and great food...  We went for a lunch and after sitting at a table in the restaurant, based on their questions, I informed them we are there for alacarte and not buffet. Immediately they were taken a back and we were informed that it will take really long time to serve for Ala carte (25-28mins) I really felt bad and informed them that we weren't informed about it during reservations(we should have been informed that it's buffet only for lunch)  Anyhow, just for the sake that we were already there and it was crossing lunch our, we told we will wait for 25mins and get us food.. The waiter went in and came back and suggested us to take something else from menu, which they can serve faster.. So we told him only to suggest about it because we aren't aware as to what food takes how long. I told the person directly, that I am not aware of any other restaurants around the area, if not I would have walked out right away.. Later he again went inside and came back and informed us that they can get veg platter in 25mins. And so we waited..  The food finally arrived and it was delicious. We can make out that the food was freshly made and it was yummy.. We finished rest of the other ordered items and in the end we were served gulab jamoons as complimentary.  If my stomach was not full then I would have definitely tried the Malai Lassi.. I will be back soon during better hours..  Jayashankar - we appreciate his service, courtesy and professionalism..  Good job team"
5.0,Always delighted with the service and food. Great ambiance as usual. Celebrated our anniversary here. Would love coming back again. Served very well by Amresh.

5.0,"I visited this place with my husband for dinner. The menu here is full of different and unique variety. Along with the awesome taste, the chef also pays keen interest in the presentation of food. The staff are way more courteous and efficient. They help you to decide the dishes according to your taste bud. For me this place deserves regular visit."
5.0,"We were here for our anniversary lunch. We were greeted with nice and elegant table decorations. Food was good. We were offered a private seating area where we could enjoy personal time with some delicious food. Mock tails were amazing. Our celebration was concluded by a nice cake from the restaurant. Thanks to our host Mr. Raju and other staffs, we had an amazing time."
5.0,"Awesome place. Went there with my friends. Nice ambience, full mughlai feel. Food is great, super tasty and service fast.. Will recommend everyone. 1K per head"
5.0,"Decent ambience, dim lights and great food. The staff is very courteous and service is great. If you're here do try the dwarkanath papdi chat and aloo muki in the starters, simply loved them. The other notable dish was baked rasgulla, though it takes some preparation time, but definitely worth it. Cost of dishes, slightly on the higher side but overall it's a great place to have a nice dinner."
5.0,"We came here for a night out on Sunday after sorting this out from a bucket of options to visit- and we simply loved it. We wanted to try out some new place that's when we came across this place as per Zomato Gold suggestions. This place has Excellent Decor and interiors and Soothing Ambience. It has Zomato gold applicable on drinks (2+2 Drinks) so don't miss out on that.  Loved every bit of the experience. Staff was Very warm in accommodating our preferences. its exclusive and worth it. The live IPL screening kept us under the hood. The food just made our day. Delicious mouth watering dishes and a good service with all the waiters being really polite and friendly. The service is impeccable and best part, its not every expensive as well!  The chef came to every table to ask if the Food was up to the expectations and we did not disappoint them with great feedback. Every non-vegetarian must visit this place. Was mesmerised by the presentation and prompt service.  The name stood for it Sultan of spice.  Will surely visit again."
5.0,"Perfect food, perfect service, every staff was polite and diligent. Had a great time. A must visit place with friends and family. The aam panna was the best"
5.0,"Really liked the hospitality of Raju,Jayshankar and others. Food was also nice.We opted for buffet and the menu was good. Although they can increase the varities in all 3 sections starters/main course/desserts"
2.0,"Went here on seeing the impressive menu for sultani dawat on sunday...And I was disappointed...Firstly the good parts. Some of the starters were good like chicken leg, an egg starter, crispy corn and the mutton in main course. Service is good and ambience is nice Now let's talk about the not so good points. Some of the starters are not good , paneer tikka was not good as paneer tasted sour,fish tikka was not fresh mutton seekh was pretty okayish..biryani was not good as well, too much of essence or fragrance in it..the chef told us it's Lucknow style. I am from Lucknow and I must add it's nothing like that at all...the major disappointment were the deserts...overly sweet..you can't eat more than 2 bites..gulab jamun over sweet, anjeer kheer was not good, ice creams were a disaster and had loads of sugar..the chats items also were not upto mark..  I went from Whitefield to kormangala to try out the place..had high hopes and it did not deliver..not recommended.ambience , service everything is good but food is the main deal and the place comes very short on it..."
5.0,"Very friendly staff, quality food, great ambience . Very friendly staff name jayashankar good knowledge of taste of combination. Best dish stuffed chicken."
5.0,The food was really nice. The ambience was  also good. Service was promt. There were many options in the starter in veg as well as in non -veg sections.The
3.0,"Not a so good choice. We opted because my friend was keen on trying this place. The service was a let down - appeared that we were being favoured. We literally had to beg for the starters to be repeated. A couple of starters on the menu were not served at all and after pointing out we were told that they are over. How wonderful! Only a couple of starters were good. Rest all can be skipped.  On the top of it, the restaurant charged me 40 for 20 water bottle. The reason was - we served you the bottle on the table. Another wonderful reason. I have already complained against them for charging more than the MRP and I am following up."
4.0,The service and food both are fabulous are here. The staff is really nice and understands your taste. Good place to have drinks and food. Thank you Spice of Sultan.
5.0,"First things first the service over here is top notch. They take feedback very seriously. We ordered a starter Alumatar in mango mustard sauce, the sauce was sweet and not to our liking ... But the starter itself with other chutneys was really good. The classic butter garlic naan was amazing. The subzi was particularly bland and the chef visited us tool feed back and changed the subzi and it was pretty good after that .. I think this was just a taste preference and not restraint issue. We lived the overall experience despite the small hiccups . Over and above all they gave a complimentary gulab jamoon which was just lovely and made the experience totally worth it"
2.0,"Too costly and not a place to go for buffet...especially on weekends, table service is too slow , I went with my family recently and it was very pathetic each dish they served... I wouldnt prefer next time to go there.."
5.0,The place was really nice and the food was delicious the best ever dinner I have had until now. Perfect service and amazing staff. We will surely visit again
3.0,"Ambience & Hospitality is very good.. the staff is extremely courteous... however the taste of the food was very mediocre .. we had the buffet - Other than the Biriyani, the Mutton gravy & the Kathal Kebab, nothing really worked ...  For Hospitality - 4.5  For Food - 3"
5.0,"Tasty and delicious food, ambience was also good. Jaishankar had got us food as per our level of spicy. Chef could quickly make unique delicious less spicy starter that everyone liked."
5.0,The place is really nice and calm. The service is very quick and the staff are very polite and humble. Special mention to Jai Shankar. Must visit place
4.0,"great place to chill out with your colleagues.. decent north indian food options to try out from. Place provides a decent options on starters, main course and desserts.  Live counter also has some options to choose from."
4.0,Good place and good ambience. Food is good but a little costly comparatively. The dark and relaxing ambience gives you a good time to spend though.
5.0,"We went there on a Monday evening for some fine dining - And we just loved it . The round table , and live IPL screening under the perfect lights with the wow ambience - kept us hooked to that place. The staff was very friendly . And coming to food section - we ordered , a veg tomato and cheese soup - which was hell delicious and paya and egg soup - which did not meet our expectations. Going to main course - we ordered mutton Rara Gosht - too yummy , laccha paneer Rohini - which we did not like since it was on sweeter side inspite showing spicy mark beside it. And dal , tandoori roti and jeera and peas rice - All good and basic. We ended it up with watermelon cooler - which was basically a soda with watermelon slices in it - loved it ! Cherry to the cake was the finger bowl - it looked so vintage and lovely to dine there. Thanks to team for a wonderful fine dining :)."
5.0,"It was a pleasure dining in this restaurant. The staffs were really friendly. And the best part you can first notice about this restaurant is it's ambience. It is beautifully decorated and same will reflect in the food they serve. More than the taste, the garnishing of the food is more attractive. Beautifully served and the taste is also too good. They serve Angaar chicken with old rum :D & as you can see, there's a mango shake in a light bulb,haha ...what can be more attractive than this. Must try restaurant & a must visit again :)"
5.0,"One of the best place in city for non veg lover. The mutton will make you lick your finger.  After hearing much from friends we headed to explore it's uniqueness. The place doesn't just surprised us with the beautiful ambience and nice decorations but made us fall in love with the food which is served smoking hot and tasty.  We have tried chicken tikka, mutton Rohan Josh and king fish with couple of beers. Expect fish which I didn't like up-to an extent everything is worth an applause.  Every non-vegetarian must visit this place to fulfill ones toungue desire. The name stood for it Sultan of spice.  Will surely visit again."
5.0,Nice place to have afternoon lunch Well spread platter with nice live counter dishes Courteous staff especially Mr. Santhosh & Nihar Keep up the same work Overall good experience
5.0,"First of i like that puprle chairs....Place is not very big, but interior is fantastic Food -5/5 Staff-5/5 Ambiance 4.5/5 Price 4/5 So i visited this place with my family, no doubt food was delicious, starters was very nice, but i think main course was having less varieties I would suggest to everyone to have family time here"
5.0,"Went to the place to try out some north indian buffet. It was Lovely. The food was great, served by very friendly staff. Also the price for the buffet is very pocket friendly. Surely worth visiting the place."
5.0,Visited this place for my Corporate Team Lunch. One of the best buffets one can have . Service is very good. Lot of variety for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian folks. Zomato gold is applicable on drinks so don't miss out on that.
5.0,"Wings dunked in Old monk rum and special spices, cooked in pressure cooker and then grilled to a char that's called 'Dumwala Old Monk Chinese Wings'. Old monk lovers a must try Food was excellent. Loved the ambience too"
5.0,"It was a very good experience. Food was very good,the ambience was also nice . Service was also very good with them caring care very nicely."
4.0,"We had heard a lot about this place and thought our anniversary would be an ideal occasion to visit coming as we were from across town. Decor and ambience are pretty pleasing on the eye and the staff is excellent in their service and always greet you with a smile.  They have an interesting live counter set up which served things like chaat, desi pasta etc and they serve you a variety of veg and non veg starters on the table. The chaat was pretty good as was the lacha paneer pav and amongst the starters the Kalmi kebab, paneer tikka, dahi kebab and mutton Chapli (a version of shami kebab) were outstanding.  The main course consists of the usual suspects as in most buffets, dal, paneer lababdar, malai kofta, assorted veg, chicken, mutton rogan josh and veg and non veg biryani. The veg section was excellent but the rogan josh and the biryani were disappointing. Especially the biryani which seemed to be spiceless and underprepared.  The dessert counter was fabulous and one especially enjoyed the Mohan Bhog which is rather rare to find in restaurants.  Cheers,"
4.0,"I happened to visit this place with friends while wandering in Koramangala in search of some desi food. And I must say it turned out to be quite a good spot and we ended up having a hearty meal.  We ordered: CP Aloo tikki- this was delicious Aam Panna- a must try to beat the summer heat (Gone are the days of the lovely Bengaluru weather) Pomegranate shikanji- this was average and could be given a miss Tandoori veg platter- Hariyali kebab and veg seekh kebab deserves a special mention, soft and melts in the mouth. Gobi, paneer and mushroom tasted well too. Paneer tikka achaari- average Id say. Could make a better choice for curry Sultans murg Mussalam- the chicken was well roasted and gravy served with this was delicious  Gulab jamun- perfect end to the feast.  Also, the service is worth mentioning. The staff was very friendly and helpful while recommending portions."
5.0,Amazing fooooooood! Yummiest zafrani biriyani and mutton starters! Actually every dish has a unique preparation and amazing taste! My fav place
3.0,"The ambience of this is place is very good. The food is also delicious, but the same cannot be said about the drinks they offer. Desserts like jalebi, ras malai are not good and i would not recommend to order them. Final verdict this place is has good food, ambience and service but drinks and deserts are not worth it."
5.0,"Fabulous place for non vegetarians. Awesome taste and presentation. Ambiance is very nice with light music in background. I ordered tandoori chicken, Amritsari fish fry and chicken dahi kabeb in snacks. And mutton Biryani with mutton gravy in main course. Everything was very tasty."

4.0,Visited for a business buffet. Service was slow but well behaved staff with polite behaviour. Less options for vegetarians. Desserts was best part of the buffet. Drinks were average at best. Starters were great again Ambience:4/5 Taste:-3.5/5 Overall :-3.75/5
4.0,"I have been to this place many times as it is located near to my office. This is a very good place for buffets. I liked keema pav and burger on the counter. It was so delicious.  Starters are excellent. The place will be crowded though, so expect delay in service."
5.0,Had an overall great experience. The ambience on a Sunday night was calm and relaxed coupled with great food and courteous service which made it the perfect way to end the weekend. Of course to experience their great menu one has to go for their amazing lunch buffets.

5.0,Loved the place and food..  Had a great time..  The Punjabi murgh masala was simply awesome..  Will visit again with my friend's..  Keep up the same quality..
5.0,"The ambience is perfect for any date or just casual dining. Pulled out from Mughal era, the restaurant is sure to treat you with some great starters. The coolers are a must try esp the keshari thandai. The starters are good as well. we tried the gulati kebab and old monk wings. The latter was a lil strong and had a pungent smell given the rum.. but tasted great.. the desserts are to die for..  A must visit with your girl or lady .."

5.0,"what a nice and excellent place to hangout with family and friends..ambience was nice and food was good, service was excellent..will visit again"
4.0,"The ambiance you get is more than what you pay for. It has fancy Mughalai touch to everything, including the food. I wouldn't say its the best place for curries, tikkas and thandhooris. But I can assert with confidence that none of it will disappoint. I'd recommend the biryanis as well. The desserts are made exceedingly well and is a must try. So is the masala chas and Amritsari lassi."
4.0,"Had come here with dinner with family. Great service and beautiful ambience. Had ordered jalebi, rasmalai, Halwa, paneer sabzi, mushroom, prawn and murg tulsi khaas. All were very delicious. Good place to celebrate with family."

5.0,"This is the third I am here, and I have to say everytime I love to come back. You need to try out the murgh mussalam and mutton boti shoti they are just amazing. The courteous behavior of the servers is a novelty which you'll hardly find in any place. Topped with that is the presentation of the food. These ppl know what they serve need to be class A so that it etches a mark in the customer's heart and gladly they donot fail in that! The murg mussalam's gravy is like liquid gold poured in a jar, eat it with naan or plain rice or the rice they actually serve with it you'll be a happy person for quite a long time. Pay visit and i guarantee the chances of you getting disappointed is bleak."

Both fresh, tasty and good quantity. Service is good , ambiance and place up to the standards. Only thing that felt off was staff asking us to write a review there and asking us to mention there names by standing beside us while we type ."
4.0,Awesome starters and desserts. Live chat is cool and yummy. Do book a table in advance as weekends can get crowded for sure You could ask for the corner tables if you want privacy and have you got children
5.0,Ended up here for dinner after a shopping spree in Koramangala and this place just made ourday with their food and service.  Food: Papdi chaat Paneer Tikka Achari was perfectly cooked and served with love. The main highlight was the freshly made Butter Naan. Crispy yet Soft    Service: As mentioned earlier the staff is very respectful and courteous.  Ambience: Lavish Interiors and very quiet as it was a weekday.  Truly enjoyed my dining experience here. Thank you Sultans of Spice team for your amazing food and service. Will definitely come again.
4.0,We had a really nice experience. Raj was the maitre'd for the evening. Overall 4/5 Butter chicken and dahi puri wee the standout dishes for the evening. Recommended!!!!
5.0,The name of this restaurant describes the place really well. Every item was a perfect blend of spices and taste. Their food is authentic mughlai.  We tried their murg makani and rara gost. It was really good. We also got complementary paan shot which is always an added icing on the top.  This place is most suitable for families as it nice and quite. Service was quick and efficient. Overall a really good place if you have a craving for mughlai food.  Food: 9/10 Ambience: 8/10 Service: 9/10
4.0,"There's something for everyone. Give your taste buds a roller-coaster ride. First thing that tricked our mind in opting this place for Sunday buffet lunch is its pleasing ambience, it's definitely worth mentioning. A clean, cozy, romantic, comfortable cuisine with Arabic, Dilli, Punjabi delicious delight served right on our plates. The staff welcomed us soon after our presence at their place and alloted out 15 seater big table. Out team opted for non-veg buffet and couple of us opted for veg buffet. The restaurant do has authentic Arabic, Dilli, Punjabi style food. The staff were just doing the job right but serving was sto back always. We were waiting our hands dried. But whenever they served they served it fresh. Definitely thumbs up for that. There is enough space for the restaurant to improvise. There's alw3a room for negotiation in final price if you are going in a big number. As it's name ""Sultan of Spices"" it should justify the dishes with great robust spices in it and please catch up quick with the orders and customers requests."
5.0,"The famous Mughalai cuisine evolved in India during the age of Sultans. Generally quite spicy, rich and heavy marked with a very unique aroma, Mughlai cuisine has over time remained one of the most popular among food enthusiasts across India. The cuisinehas a profound influence on the culinary styles and regional cuisines of present-day India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan and its cooking style are applied in traditional North Indian cuisines, particularly in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. The cuisine also marks its influence in Pakistan Muslim immigrants who migrated from different regions of India. The Mughal cooking techniques also had irreversible influence in the Awadh region which eventually led to the development of the Awadhi cuisine of Lucknow. Sultans of Spice is one such restaurant that brings about the same taste and style to the tables of Bengaluru.                                                                 ...Read full post on eattherapy.com"

5.0,Heard of this place a lot and decided to try something out with a foodie group. Believe me it didn't disappoint us barring a dish. It was not that tasty and they replaced it with in 10 minutes by getting the cook to the table . Service and quality of food is awesome and it is definitely a place for team lunch/dinner. Didn't tried the buffet but they decorated the place so lovely .
5.0,"I loved this place. I reached around 3 PM and buffet was supposed to be closed at 3.30 PM. Still they didn't disaapoint me.  I had the best Keema pav ever. Though keema was not available, still they made it just for me and it was a lovely gesture.  I loved Egg chilly, Fish kabab, Mutton curry, Mutton seekh kabab and Chat.  I would love to visit this place again soon. But i will try to reach sooner to make sure i enjoy every bit of it."
5.0,"Food was tasty with good options, service was good, staff were friendly and ambience was nice. Overall, a good experience. Buffet should be preferred for lunch and ale carte for dinner."
4.0,"Good food nice ambience. It was crowded, not complaining about that but while serving starters they just ask one person and leave (non-veg person most of the times reject few veg items that doesn't mean all on table dont want that we had to keep calling them, reminding there are vegetarians like me sitting too, like few restaurants provide different plates for veg and and non-veg which clears confusion, don't understand why few don't do that)  All in all good starters, main course and deserts. Oh one suggestion, have few more restrooms atleast separate hand washing areas one isn't enough for full house crowd"
5.0,"It was wonderful and warm evening.  Sultan guys were very humble . Raju was attending us and he was so helpful while suggesting orders . About food , you will not have disappointments at all.  We ordered flamed chicken ,that was a stealer of the evening.  We also ordered biryani and I must admit I havent had a better one in Bangalore ! Its a dum biryani so do not compare your other experiences of biryanis here."
4.0,"Beautiful ambience. Smiling and attentive wait staff. Orders were taken a tad bit in a hurry. However, the food was brilliant. Be it the khameri roti or the tandoori veg platter, it was real good food.   A couple of guests with me ordered a mutton and chicken starter and mentioned that the meat was succulent and lovely. The mutton starter was excessively seasoned.   A wonderful place for a wonderful evening."
4.0,Went there for their lunch buffet (sultani theme) on a Sunday. Service is ok could improve a bit on the snacks. Overall the spread was good. 4 points for the effort

5.0,"DAWAT-E-MONTH  What did I try: Buffet  Food: 5/5 Excellent food. Both in terms of quality and taste. Delicious it was!! Prepared in a hygenic way with almost-no-oil and still delicious. Especially, bread based food items.  Must try: Paneer malai sabz, Afghani aloo, Pao bhaji, Vada pao and Moong daal halwa.  Have everything in small-small quantity. I still couldn't have everything that was there. That's the wide range of options that were available. Starting from Starters, Shorba, Main course, Desserts to live counter. I don't have many picture to share as food took away my all attention :)  Service: 5/5 No complaints. In fact, the staff was really quick in seving food requested, without the second reminder.  Ambience: 5/5 It was like an old-retro-afghani styled restaurant. Percect amount of lighting and nicely choosen theme of retro-blue and golden colors.  Background music: 5/5 Though it was bit loud but the choices were perfect for my taste  Go for it!!! You won't regret it, if you want to have an authentic north-indian punjabi and afghani food."
5.0,"The moment I entered in the restaurant , the place and the interior was so attractive and well decorated with lots of dark lightnings around the walls. Ambiance was so amazing and so clean and hygienic. They also have Terrace for parties and all and you can enjoy your meal with an amazing view."
4.0,"This was my first visit to Koramangala, and I was suggested to try out Sultans of Spice for a nice buffet lunch well on par with other restaurants. Located on the 5th Block, and on the second(or third) floor of BluPetal Hotel, we went there on a regular weekday, and were surprised to find the place packed. Luckily, a booking was made prior to our arrival, so we had to wait for a couple of minutes for them to arrange the table.  The interior is bedecked with beautiful lights and the place has a royal touch to it, something which you would expect. Upon entrance you would be greeted by the Chaat counter, which has always seemed unnecessary to us. Anyway, we took a table by the window, and were promptly greeted by the waiters, and within a minute they started to serve the starters.  The vegetarian starters were amazing; it consisted of; Roasted Pineapple Pickled Potato Mushroom Baby Corn And others  In the Non-Veg section, there were; Quintessential Tangdi Kebab Fish Tikka Prawn Mutton Sheekh Kebab  Felt the prawn wasn't up to the mark.  Once we were done with the starters, we stepped out of the seating area, and in front of us was a beautiful table donned in shimmering lights. We tried the Murgh main course, which was rich in spices, and rightly so. The Biryani was nothing special, and felt the sides were more suited to Indian breads.  In fairness, a great buffet needs to have a lavish dessert spread, and Sultans of Spice doesn't tick a box there. The Blueberry Mousse and Coffee Caramel Pastry were excellent, and felt the Malpua was just about right, but Anjeer ke Jalebis wasn't worth a try. Forgot the name of the dessert, but it was more like Rasmaalai, which served pretty well when paired with the Malpuas.  Special credit to the staff, who were at it every time we needed something. The place is beautiful and barring the dessert section, it is worth the money."
3.0,"Starters were really good. Ambience was royal and staff was friendly but main course and mocktails were average, not worth the cost. Service was slow as the staff got us mocktails after we finished everything."
3.0,spicy food.. and tasty..i recommted to my Friends as well.good restaurant for variety tastes and reasonable price as wel..ambience is good...
4.0,"This place has been on my list for a long time and finally made it two days back. Ambience goes with the name. Decent spread with satisfying taste. Mutton seek and veg seek kabab were awesome. So were few other starters like prawn and crispy corn. I felt Thangdi kabab and tikki could have been better. Fish was average. There was a unique starter made out of boiled egg, I'm not an egg lover but it was different. Could not get to taste the potato and mushroom but potato looked yummy.  In the main course malai kofta was done well, mutton and methi chicken was fine. Rotis were good.  Dessert section was definitely not disappointing, loved the carrot halwa and gulab jamun.  Extremely friendly staff :)"
5.0,We had been here for buffet and it was great experience of tasty food and beautiful presentation. Both veg and nonveg starters were nice. Raju was attentive and quick. Great service. I recommend this place.
5.0,Thanks to Raju for excellent service and make ambiance very comfortable. We have enjoyed a lot thanks...we look forward to come again as we liked a lot...
2.0,we went to the restaurant based on High rating to celebrate an occasion. the ambience was nice after that it was just downhill. we asked for non veg buffet and the staff kept coming with veg..had to finally tell them to bring non-veg and the taste was disappointing. we then moved to main course we were probably the first ones that day and could see hot food with layer that it get...so it was a turn off...good was only ok. naan was good though and saving grace. in sweet jalebi was nice...rusmalai was bitter...had to leave it. perhaps it was one of those days when food is not good but it was not a good memorable day.
5.0,"If you want good North Indian food, look no further! This place offers Dilli, Afghani, and Punjabi cuisine and some of the dishes were simply outstanding. The ambiance is pleasant with sufficient seating space and there is a buffet spread as well. Starters to begin your meal could be: Chicken badam shorba- the consistency was good, had good chunks of chicken in it. Malai kesar bharwan paneer tikka is a must try here! So soft that it melts in your mouth Murg tulsi khaas had a good flavour and soft chicken pieces. I enjoyed the Tandoori prawns here. Also, the old monk chicken wings is a nice twist to the regular wings that you get in other places.  Apart from these dishes, we also tried a couple of other items: The main course was delectable. The kabuli naan was a very well balanced bread with little sweetness from the dry fruits. Eat it with dal makhani or punjabi murgh gravy and you are good to go. I also tried the nalli mutton gravy which was splendid! I had an assorted plate of Indian desserts which was a nice and sweet journey for me.  In a nutshell, I enjoyed my time here with good food and courteous service. This is a must try place for all North Indian cuisine lovers!"
5.0,So the food was very authentic and wholesome. The service was perfect and special thanks to Asif who made my dinner memorable by his 10 on 10 service.
4.0,"Been here once in 2014, back then I was not into writing reviews on Zomato. It's a nice place to go to if you wanna taste north Indian/Afghani cuisine. A large dining hall with a very good light setting and playing good music. Their vegetarian offerings are probably the best I have seen in Bangalore.   They have a separate Pav Bhaji Counter and a Jalebi-Rabdi counter. The Jalebi-Rabdi is one of my favorite items here! After I finished the main course and went to the dessert section, I thought I should have skipped the main course. Be it the Jalebi, Moong-Dal Halwa, Sultanat-E-Jamun [Basically Jamun floating in Mango River May be;-) ]  and Malai Sandwich, it was simply superb. A complimentary Paan drink is served in a shot glass at the end of your meal  I absolutely love this concept.  Hats off to the management for having a courteous staff who are always eager to serve their customers. Not all restaurants have courteous staff these days. Lastly the price was also pocket friendly considering the price range of other restaurants in Koramangala. It's definitely worth a visit and hence recommending this place."
5.0,"One of the best place to eat. We ordered Tandoori butter nun, galoti kabab as starters, afgani mutton rogan curry. All the foods were so good. The galoti kababs melted in mouth as it should be.

5.0,Amazing food. Specially the stuffed Tangri kabab recommended by Ashif. Staff is very courteous. Totally satisfied with the service and food. Mohammed Ashif and Taukir were both very courteous. Excellent service provided by both of them.
1.0,"I had tried placing an order at Sultans of Spice through a popular delivery service. When my driver reached the restaurant he was told that they didn't want to make the order. I asked him to let me talk to the manager there so that I could understand the issue but they refused to come on the phone and rudely asked him to leave. Given the positive experience of so many at this restaurant, I'm sure this was a one off incident but it is vital to note that in the service industry it is important to be polite and respectful to not only wealthy customers but also to the innumerable delivery executives that come on our behalf to receive your excellent food. It is a pity that I wasn't given a chance to sample your food solely due to the arrogance that your staff meted out to a poor delivery executive that was just doing his job. I hope you take this criticism in the right spirit and rectify and train your staff to respect all people regardless of their monetary value. Thanks"

5.0,Really beautiful place. Great ambience. nice music And Great Food teast. Service is very Good by Mohammed TOKIR.Will Definitely Recommend a visit to this place thank you
2.0,"Sultans of spice, royal interiors with mughal touch. They served pepper pappad and gol gappas as complimentary. Ambience and service was good. They did not have much variety in soup. They had just 3 options in soup - mutton, chicken and crab. We ordered Paya aur aunde ka sorba (mutton). After few minutes the staff came up telling that it is not available. In spite of having just 3 options in soup, they were not able to serve us what we ordered. Then we had to settle with a Badam aur murg ka sorba (chicken) as we are not a crab person. Then we ordered Mughal chicken biriyani and didnt like the flavour. We ended up paying high for a below average food."
4.0,"Headed for a late Sunday dinner here. Location is easy to reach. The ambiance is simple but elegant, the pleasant aroma hits you the moment you step in. They can do better with a little more space around the tables. We ordered kebab rasmonak in starters which is an interesting preparation of tandoor grilled stuffed mushrooms. The pinneapple chutney was tangy and refreshing. The drink we order, kache aam Ka pana was a disappointment and seemed like a synthetic preparation. Although, they were prompt to replace the same with another drink, Boondi Jaljeera, so additional points for that. The service overall was quite decent. For main course, we had Dal Sultani, which was perfectly balanced in taste. In breads, the Khomeini roti was something new, prepared with maida and yeast. By then, we were so full, we skipped the desert, though the offering looked quite appetising. Overall it was a good Delhi-style dinner, and the place is a solid option for an upscale North Indian meal."
5.0,"I have been a regular with this place and I was being served by Raju and Bisu , I must say they are the most welcoming and makes you feel special, really happy with the service and I wish to visit it again. THANKS :)"

5.0,"Fill upto your neck @ the buffet. I freaking loved the food here. They fit into the name, really the sultans of spices. They know it right how to come up with such appetizers.  Be it a weekday or weekend this place has to be housefull whenever I go. Chicken salad, salmon and horlicks barfi are the few in the bunch of palatable dishes I would have in my go to order always."

3.0,"25th Aug, Lunch - 6 people, Buffet  Although I am not a big fan of buffets, decided to go for the buffet spread this time as it had been a long time since I had a buffet lunch.  Overall: 3/5  Buffet has a decently large spread of starter, main course and desserts.  Soups and Starters served on the table - the Paya shorba was flavoursome and good. Starters - Few were good, mostly on average side.   Main Course - my favourite was mangalorean prawn curry with butter nan. the mutton rogan josh was average and adraki chicken was too adraki. Keema pav from the live counter was good. Corn garlic saag also had good flavours to it.  Desserts: there was a hair strand on the moong dal halwa serving spoon. the indian desserts very below average like mal pua was not good, jalebis were not crispy, moong dal halwa was also not up there.  Overall a good spread, food sometimes overpowered with spices, few recipes were good and flavourful, lot of them were average. may be the quantity always impacts the quantity and hence the experience gets a little affected.  Ambience: 3/5 - Nice ambience at places. Some walls has good murals. Overall a decent feel.  Service: 4/5 - Friendly ready to help proactive staff."

3.0,"Selected SOS for a team lunch after checking reviews on Zomato with high expectations. Below is the detailed review:   Ambience is quite soothing and looks refreshing with a afghani theme. Could have been a bit more bright as we felt it was a bit dark.  Variety of starters was good but the taste was average. Liked fried babycorns and Hara bhara kabab.  We ordered LIIT on Zomato gold(2+2). First serving was quite good but when we ordered again on a different Zomato gold account, it was all diluted and not upto the mark.  Main course disappointed me as I was expecting good variety of dishes. Liked fried bhindi masala and daal though. Breads served were really good and soft to have.  Good variety of desserts and taste was also good. Liked Gajar ka halwa and Ice creams.  Staff is really courteous and acts quickly on every request.  Overall, I enjoyed my time here with friends and its a one time visit place for sure!"

4.0,Located at the heart of the city this place attracts a lot of crowd.  Went there yesterday for Sunday Lunch in a group of 11 people for my friend's birthday celebration.  Ambience: The ambience is very soothing. The interior is very well designed and the seating arrangement of blue color gives a good contrast to the decor. The entrance of the resturant is well decorted.  Staff/Service: The service provided always leaves a big impact on the overall experience. Here we were basically served by 2 guys: Parwez and Asif. And both were very prompt in their service. Very polite and friendly in nature. So no complains on this part. Rather a very happy service experience.  Food/Beverages: We took the Lunch Buffet. The starters were served on the table. Veg starters had more varities than the non veg starter. I wish they had few more items for the non veg starters too. Though the main course had lots of option. Loved the Muttton in the main course. They had a live counter for Chatts and Pav Bhaji. Even they had more variety of deserts than other buffet resturants I have been. Malai Chamcham and Sandesh: we hardly get these sweets at buffet places. So it melted my heart seeing these sweets at the display. Even they had 4 variety of ice cream. But the star of the show was the welcome drink. That was something worth remembering.  So overall it was a happy experience. This place is recommended to be visited if you are in a group or if you want to go for any kind of Birthday/Anniversary celebrations.
2.0,"Not sure how come this place has been rated so high. Had been planning this place for some time due to good reviews, but didnt knew it would leave me with such bad taste. First the Positives, the Staff, Yes, they were courteous, attentive, and being in Full Restaurant environment were quite serviceable. Kudos to the Hotel for that. But apart from that, the main reason for visit, the food, for some reason was not Upto the mark of the expectations I had. Worst to mention first was the Live Counter, which was nothing but the Heating Station. The guy was just heating the stuff and serving the same. Chats were just sweet, nothing like the North Indian Chats. Starters were served on Table, same concept of 5 Veg and 5 Non Veg, but tasted very average. I guess the road side carts are way better in taste then this. But yes I can give them good marks for the food being Hot and Quantities being loaded frequently (this also will go as an addition to the staff). Main Course, hardly had any options, and instead of being Aromatic and Properly cooked, tasted more like extra Masalas and High Flame Cooking, which obviously cannot lead to good tasty food. Desserts had few options, didnt tried much, but the Jalebi and Rabri combo was good, only for the Jalebis at the Live Counter were Cold and Rabri was more of the Milk Maid concentrate then being actual Rabri.  So if you like to be treated well, without much concern with Food Taste, its a one time visit place. But in general for the Foodies with a Big Appetite, I was a put down by this place, rest is Upto you to try."
5.0,"Its qn awesome restaurant with a complete north indian taste. Asif is a wonderful person who takes care of us, usually when we visit here. Often during weekends we make a visit here."
3.0,"After reading soo many good reviews about this place om zomato, decided to visit this place ona sunday afternoon. We opted for the buffet and i am pretty sure we left the place disappointed. The food was average, nothing special neither in innovation or in taste. The veg starters were kinds tastless, non veg starters were comparatively better but not something you would wanna eat again. Only the fish was good. The maine course was better than the starters, specially the veg main cousre. There weren't many options in the. Nonveg section. And the most disappointing part was the desert, didnt like. Anything except the gulab jamun and the jalebi with rabri at the live counter. The service was the best and the ambience was also nice, as we got the round table in the corner which was perfect for a group of friends to sit and talk. Overall an okayish experience and definitely not worth the money and hype."
5.0,"Good North Indian food. We opted for buffet, spread was good and elaborate. They also have live counter serving chats. Good service by staff, specially Asif."

4.0,"Very nice food. The service was also good. We were assigned a very professional waiter Raju who did nice recommendations. We had seekh kebab, galaouti kebab as starters which were good. Main course was also very good in quantity as well as quality. We had chicken tikka and pind ka gosht."
5.0,To start of with -- Great food and courteous staff. Wide range of vegetarian food as well!! Else it becomes really really difficult to hang out with family and friends who are vegetarians.

3.0,"The ambience is good but the food is average, at least for vegetarians. If however, you are a North Indian, craving for daal makhani, this is the place to go. After a long time, felt the dal was good and tasted like it's counterparts in Delhi. Went for the buffet, looking at the chat spread, but wasn't very impressed. That being said, the service is nice and the staff is very courteous. Overall a good experience but the food can be better."

5.0,The ambience of this place is really nice and the staffs are very polite. Food is fantastic. Specially the sultani tandoori chicken. Chicken was tender and all the spices were well absorbed in the chicken. We ordered mutton biryani which was good as well.
5.0,tasty and yummy food.. good place for family and friends get-together. starter and dessert was super tasty lots of options. pavez was serving our table..he was good
4.5,The place has wide range of buffet.  Went out with my family & we all enjoyed. The food is definitely good. Had ordered galoti kabab and can vouch it to be one of the best in Bangalore though little heavier on the pocket. But definitely a good place for buffet with family n friends
5.0,"One of the best restaurant I have been to. Although they have regular dishes but the magic is created with there spices. Music is so soothing. If you are out on a casual romantic date, this place fits perfect. (Specially after having a lovely fight with wife.) Visited with wife to see her smile and she was in love with this place. Parwez is amazing. He always cared for our taste. Though we wanted to try things, he suggested the honest things. #amazing"
5.0,food is tasty.. but bit costly
5.0,"Had dinner with friends. Menu is perfect, something for everyone. Service was awesome and food was very delicious. Will be back definitely. Keep the good work."
3.0,"High expectations, average results.  Was here with my family for dinner. The ambience is pleasing, with soothing music.  Opted for ala carte. First to be ordered was Angaar Murgh Tikka, but without the rum (there is an option where rum is added to the preparation). It tasted just ok, and nothing like what we'd heard about it being a specialty here.  Next was Punjabi Tandoori Murgh. This was good, but to be honest, Tandoori chicken is prepared well by even your average restaurant, so really cannot say this was a standout.  Then came the Galouti Kebab, another specialty here. And this one was indeed special. Soft and fine quality mutton kebabs served with mini parathas underneath them.  Finally we ordered Chicken Biriyani. Generous in quantity, would suffice for two people, but again average in taste. And with the prices being on the higher side here, we felt the chicken pieces were fewer in number and small in size too.  The service was prompt. It ended with a nice gesture on part of the hotel staff. Had filled a feedback form, and they requested for a chat to know where exactly they could've been better. Thoughtful and diligent.  Food - 3.0 (would've given 3.5 had prices been lower)  Ambience - 4.0  Service - 4.5  Value for money - 3.0"
1.0,"I ordered a non-veg food box. Following are the things that made my lunch absolutely pathetic. 1. The quality of the food was overall bad. 2. The quantity was considerably less. 3. They charged around 440 including all taxes and packaging charges and it was a hugely disproportional charge considering the quantity and the quality of the food. 4. They mentioned mutton gravy in the list of items. Instead provided some aloo sabzi!! 5. Packaging was so worthless, that when it wa delivered, the sugar syrup from gulab jamun was all over chicken gravy, biriyani and what not!  Please do not ever order lunch boxes for an exorbitant price from thi place. They leverage their restaurant brand value to sell pathetic food over online. There are way better alternatives present around Koramangala and BTM areas for way more cheaper rates and they provide far batter quality foods."
5.0,Good ambience if you want spend some good time and good food with your family. It is preferred to book tables on weekends. Give star rating for the service.
4.0,"This place serves great starters and food, if you are bored with the usual bbq buffets, try this out. Services are good and the staff is polite. Asif served us really well, asked for our taste preferences and served us accrodingly."
5.0,Great place with amazing ambience and great service. Highly recommended for a very nice dinner date. Me and my SO were greatly impressed by our waiter mr.asif who was available at our Beck and call
4.0,This place is best for family get together. If someone wants to spend long hours with good food this is the place!   Food is very spicy here they have some very good curries  Non veg guys will enjoy this place as they have more non veg varieties!   Service is very good. Ambience is good!
3.0,"We found this place thru Zomato and decided to pay a visit. This place has some great staff and good ambience. Starters (Angara chicken and murgl and Tulsi khaas and shorba(paya aur ande ka shorba) Shimla mirchi ka shroba were just average. I must mention about their amazing zaffrani mutton biryani. generous portion , Well cooked meat and lots of fried onions. Will definitely be back again for Biryani!"
4.0,"A place with soothing ambience and great flavours. The waiters could have been a little more polite and efficient in their service. Service was a little slow but can forgive that as we went as a group of 11. Overall, a good experience and good food. A couple of dishes Never to try a again, yet others you can go for again and again."
4.0,"This place is located in The Blu Petal Hotel on JNC road and we keep crossing it but never really got a chance to try it out. Finally, we decided to go here and it's safe to say we weren't disappointed. As you walk in, you see a large well done up place which is perfect for a family style restaurant. The decor is modern and perfectly suits the theme of the restaurant.  Beverages To start our evening, we were given the Chutzpah and the Virgin T.B.D. The Chutzpah was a Beer based cocktail and it is something we really liked. The Virgin TBD was a little sweet for our liking but it was very refreshing and a good way to start our meal.  Appetizers To start our meal, we ordered the Chatpate Paneer Roll, Malai Kesar Bharwan Paneer Tikka (Stuffed Paneer Tikka), Tikka Rasmonak (Stuffed Mushroom), Hara Bhara Sarson Kebab, Makai Aur Cheese Ke Kebab, Murgh Angaar Tikka (Flambayed with Rum) and Mutton Galouti Kebab.  The Paneer Roll was unfortunately too hard and not soft and succulent the way you would expect Paneer to be served. The filling too was very spicy and too tangy hence it is not something we liked. The Paneer Tikka on the other hand was soft and had a burst of flavour when you bit into it. Fresh and well cooked Paneer certainly made elevated the dish. The Stuffed Mushroom was easily the highlight of the vegetarian appetizers as it had an intense mix of flavours which we absolutely loved along with some perfectly cooked Mushroom. The Hara Bhara Kebab was rather bland and boring. While it was well cooked and had some great flavours, it lacked the seasoning that we expected it to have. The Corn and Cheese Kebab also was rather disappointing as it was too hard to bite and we felt it was slightly over fried  In the non  vegetarian section they had done a phenomenal job. The Murgh Angaar Tikka which was flam bayed with rum was great with some perfectly cooked chicken along with the subtle rum undertones which certainly elevated the dish. The Galouti Kebab was the highlight of the evening for us with Lamb which was so soft, that it just melted in your mouth when you bit into it. We had to lick our plate clean with that dish.  Main Course For the next part of our meal we ordered the Khameeri Roti, Kabuli Naan and Tandoori Roti along with the Kofta E Sultan, Paneer Tikka Achari, Punjabi Murgh Tikka Masala and Gosht Ke Nalli.  Firstly, the Khameeri Roti was easily some of the best Indian Breads we have ever had. It was so soft and fluffy along with the fact that it went well with every single gravy that we had ordered. Moving to the gravies, the Kofta was rich doused in a heavily flavoured Gravy. It felt like we were royalty when we were eating it because of the consistencies and flavours which we were getting. The same could be said about the Paneer Tikka Achari which had large well cooked pieces of Paneer along with some rich flavourful gravy.  The Punjabi Murgh Tikka Masala was again another side which we loved as it had some perfectly cooked Chicken with a slightly greasy gravy but at that point we didnt really have a problem with anything due to how rich all the food was. The Gisht Ke Nalli was also something we have never had before and it was rather interesting for us.  Dessert To end our meal, we ordered the Jalebi Rabdi, Baked Rasgulla and Chocolate Gol Gappa. The Jalebi Rabdi had some fat and crisp Jalebis served along with some well made Rabdi. It was easily the highlight of the desserts for us. The Baked Rasgulla was also something new to us and while we felt it was a little too sweet, we finished it nonetheless. The only slight negative we had was with the Chocolate Golgappa which was innovative without a doubt but, unfortunately its not something we particularly liked as it had four different kinds of chocolate textures which didnt go too well with the Pista which they had added to it.  Overall Verdict We went in with expectations which were not too high as there are not too many places in the city which serve great North Indian food but this place certainly surpassed our expectations. This place would be perfect if you want to be pampered with some great North Indian food when you are with your family or friends. We certainly think all of you should try out this place as we certainly liked almost everything we had.  Food: 4/5  Price: 4/5  Ambience: 4/5  Service: 5/5"
4.0,tasty
5.0,The best place to kick back and enjoy a night with delicious mean. Ask for Asif and he will provide you the best experience. The quality of food is really nice.
5.0,"Spoiler Alert: I am a veggie. if you are looking for anything else, save your time and look elsewhere :)  Food: food is different here and in a good way. I tasted a couple of dishes for the first time.  A chilli jalebi - what a contrast but together  they tasted great! An absolute must try.   The starters were good too and tasted different from other such barbeque places.   Generally, the spice is on the higher side. Ask to mellow down in case you cannot handle it.  Place is neat and clean and staff is extremely courteous. Overall a great place and we had a good time."
5.0,"Sultan of spices indeed, this place needs no introduction for the food lovers of Bangalore. Very friendly and polite staff , everyone greets and serves with a smile. Lovely ambience , makes you feel cozy. Service is the highlight of this place. The manager and servers are very courteous and take feedback for each and every dish. Coming to the food, we had opted for a lunch buffet. Drink: The aam panna drink was too sour for my taste. Soup: paya shorba had strong flavour. Absolutely delicious. Non veg starter: chicken tangri kabab deserves special mention here. Juicy, chicken pieces were cooked to perfection, slightly charred on the outside and tender inside. The flavours of the marinade had penetrated deep into the flesh giving a wonderful flavour in each bite. Chickn chapli kaba was a bit dry but the manager got them prepared again, a little better the second time. Veg starter: aloo peanut tikki tasted surprisingly good. Main course: zafraani malai kofta had an amazing gravy. The kofta balls were a bit dry. Chicken biryani was very aromatic with juicy chickn pieces. Dessert: The payasam gulabjamun combo tastes amazing. Do try if it's available. Blueberry pastry and brownies were fresh and had a nice taste. Overall, a very satisfying experience. Would love to visit again."

4.0,I was out with my girl for a dinner date and somehow the place we booked was closed down which made us visit this restaurant. We wanted to have authentic North Indian food and yes! Our taste buds were treated with utmost delicacy. Malai kofta and dal makhani were too good...The service is excellent and they will always be concerned if something is required at the table..it's a typical restaurant with no alcohol and bevarages but worth a visit. Had a good experience
5.0,"Food was awesome, ambience serene. Service quality excellent. Raju and Balram were very helpful and supportive ! Great visit overall. Will repeat for sure in the coming weeks with friends and family"
5.0,Great place . Service and food quality is awesome .A must visit place .Santosh had great serving qualities. Price is also reasonable.an awesome place to hangout on weekends
2.0,"Their food is just spicy, there is no flavor to it. The service is not so good, it took us 45 minutes to get our food that we ordered. None of the dishes were of good taste, the food was so spicy that we had to come home and find something to eat. The staff was polite and offered to reduce the spice level, but even after that the food was just too spicy. You cannot make a dish tasty just by adding too much hot spice to it."
5.0,Biriyani is must try.Good service and optimally priced.Their paneer roll was bit spicy .Served excellently by Raju and Jamal. The Shimla mirch was also on spicy side
5.0,Food is awesome.ambience is good Menu is good. Parwez' suggested us some good dishes.His service is also good. Perfect food and taste.must visit place

3.0,"When you have your family visiting Bangalore, obviously a decent lunch buffet is a must. Even after previously having a really bad experience at Buff Buffet Buff, I thought I can give buffet another shot at Sultan's of spice, and god I was wrong.  Sultan's of spice in a minute is your generic buffet place with the usual chicken biryani, mutton seekh kebab, chicken lollipops, Indian desserts with some cake and stuff, curries and a counter to get some so and so live food. Food options are very similar to AB's, it's just....worse.  We started off with some mutton seek kebab, murgh malai kebab, and the usual paneer starter. Now, are marinades so difficult to understand? All you have to do is marinate, leave it for some time and grill it or fry it. What I got was a plate of meaty uncooked legs with fresh curd from the marinade. Now it sometimes gets hard to keep the starters going during the golden hours so I sent it back to get it cooked, and it was still pretty raw. ""Okay! That's fine! Let's munch of some mutton shall we? Wait, what? What is this?"" For some reason, many restaurants get mutton seekh kebab wrong. I've had it in loads of restaurants and they never get it right. I always have to send it back and ask them to do something about this. The rest of the starters were the usual, decent.  The main course is pretty, sparse. Very few varieties in here. You have the biryani, assorted bread, two veg and two non-veg curries. Done. You have a chat corner which is ""decent"" but I'm not interested in filling my stomach with okayish food.  So I fiddled around with the main course a bit and jumped into the desserts section, which was really good! I was pleased to see that I can at least end my buffet with something really nice in my stomach!  Now the service and the manager was patient enough to cater all our needs and complaints so hats off to them but the food really needs a makeover."
5.0,We had a great time dining here with family. The food was kickass and drinks were nice too. I just feel there could be more veg starters. The staff was quite courteous.
5.0,"Great place, great food and great service! Had a brilliant time! Mr. Nihar- you are doing a great job serving us with a smile!! Thank you! P.S: one little feedback: music choice could be better!!"
3.0,"Asib and nihal were extremely courteous.   Review:  Pros: Ambience is good : 3.5/5 they play classical sitar as music so good for a family outing. It looks very hygienic and clean. The area is spacious and indoors.   Service: Service is quick and the people are extremely polite and sweet. Drinks were served with a little delay but okay. I would give this 4.5/5  Cons: Food: Their mughlai offering is not so great. Food is below standard, especially given they have sub-premium prices. The mint chutney was sour, dal makhni was sour and chicken was oily and more than spicy.   Would recommend any potential customer going for dinner in Koramangala to go to Roots (killer food) and an even better (and probably the best in bangalore) is Jalsa in Marathahalli.  Food Rating: 2.5/5  Thanks!"
3.0,"The staff is very professional and courteous, however, they lag behind in terms of taste of food. Ambience could be improved if they played some songs rather than just music."

5.0,"Quiet ambience. It felt like we had entered a posh place in a Persian land. The music was soothing and so was the lights. The staffs treat you like a queen. When we ordered more than we could eat, they suggested us that we dont order so much.   Coming to the food. We had pulav, Bhindi curry (dont remember the name) but it was scrumptious!! And malai kofta. Aah delicious! I loved it. And I wanted to eat more but there was no space in my tummy! Love this place and will go hear everytime I am in Bangalore."

3.0,"I had visited this place on 13th of June for team lunch, my team was first customer for that lunch on that day, first round of serving starters was awesome and delicious. 2nd round of serving starters had spoiled the reputation of their food. they were in hurry as complete lunch hall was full, they were not able to serve and cooking tandoor items had not cooked properly. it could have been more quality in terms of cooking and planning on how to give awesome customer experience when there was house full...."

The staff is very courteous and there is no service charge so tip with an open heart. Food preparation takes a little time but the wait is worth it. Recommendations : Amritsari fish fry , paneer tikka achari, Rara ghost. Wanted to try goat meat but wasn't available."
3.0,"The ambiance is good, staff is courteous.

5.0,Sultans of Spice is such a great place . I came here with my love for my birthday celebration. It was planned by my sweetheart. And it's a amazing place to take candle light dinner. Staffs are so friendly and services also very good. . Must visit place
5.0,"Had a very sumptuous food after a very long time....  Instead of writing a lengthy story, here is all in a nutshell. 1. Ambience : 4.5/5 Very nice ambience. Suits the name..  2. Location: 3/5 Although located in a prime area of Koramangala, Parking is a Big problem. Also, the location itself is not easy to navigate. Small road in one-way makes it difficult to drive. This is not a direct factor for the Restaurant as such, but it is point to keep in mind.  3. Staff: 4/5 Courteous staff. Well trained and well behaved.  4. Pricing: $$$$... Surely not too pocket friendly bit worth every penny spent, once in a while.  5. Quality & Quantity : A serving caters to 2-3 people very easily. We ordered Punjabi Murg Tikka Masala (Non-veg) & Kofta-E-Sultan (Veg) and both were very very yummy, made us lick our fingers for a while.  A must visit restaurant.... when you are in Bangalore... At least once."
5.0,"Awesome ambience, great food and courteous staffs. Service by Nihar was really wonderful. Paneer tikka , mango lassi and navratan pulao was tasty"
3.0,"Ambience, cleanliness and courteous staff all good.... We ordered paneer lachaddar, amritsari aloo kulcha, butter roti and aamm panna. We were 2 ppl, and quantity of vege was so much that 3 ppl could eat up AND AND AND.... PANEEERRR PIECES WERE LIKE TOO MUCH.. couldnt get much of gravy taste in a bite. Kindly lesson the quantity and price of veges, as when 2 ppl its hard to finish.. and that quantity of panneer is hard to get gravy taste... it just over powers all on the table. EVEN THE SPICES WITH IT."
5.0,"If you are looking for some amazing Mughlai, Punjabi  food then this is the place.  I absolutely loved the Mutton Galouti kabab. It was soooo soft that it melts in your mouth and delicately flavoured that would leave an amazing taste on your pallet. One of the best Galouti I have had.  The ambiance of the restaurant was comfortable, with a touch of Mughlai interiors."
5.0,Organised my kid's 1st Bday Party in 'Sultans of Spice' with 25 to 30 guests. Guests also were satisfied and happy with the food and with all the arrangements done over there. Basically we all had a great time there.  Ambience was good. Food taste was superb with lots of tasty varieties. Service was superb and staffs were very courteous. Seating arrangement and chairs/sofa were very comfortable with enough space to move around.  Altogether it was a very good deal in a fair price. And for future parties and dining also we will considering this place.  Thanks to the Manager of 'Sultans of Spice' (Arghya) for doing such a wonderful arrangement to help make my Party Successful.

5.0,food is simply wow. finger licking good! ambience is awesome too. must check out place if you are a non-veg lover. best dish- Pind Wala bhuna mutton
2.0,"We ordered a mutton spice dish- which was a chilli bowl, with mutton in it; rumali rot- of vulcanised rubber; a masala roti which no one could crack, and an apple cranberry mocktail- which was the only nice thing in the menu  Our waiter liked the IPL better than his job  Tip- please visit Shareif Bhai down the road. You may pick up something.  Edit: The manager later approached us :) what a sweet gentleman. Dear restaurant, everyone has bad days. And looking at your previous reviews, seems like it's inconsistency you need to work on and not the food. :)"
4.5,"The food as well as the ambience is amazing. The service staff (Balram) was also excellent..Definitely, recommend people to try it..Should definitely come here again"

5.0,"The overall experience was amazing at the restraunt. Great food with an amazing ambience. The restraunt plays a light music allowing people to talk at dinner. Parvez is attended us with utmost gratitude. Great efforts by the entire team in order to give this kind of an experience. Also forgot to mention about the food, it's amazing. Their seekh gajar halwa is a desert you definitely should try. Attaching few pictures of the dishes we ordered and the beautiful interiors."
4.0,"I have been to this place for quite number of times and love this place for food and service. Recently, I was there for dinner with family and I would say this is one of best place to have North Indian, Afghan and Muglai cuisine. This place has nice ambience and well maintained. Staff is friendly and served with smile. Food is great, delicious and tasty. We have ordered dal sorbha, dahi ke kebab, achari paneer tikka, lassi and naan. I specially like dal sorbha, achari paneer tikka and lassi. And icing on cake is pan shot which is refreshing and nice way to end your dinner. Ambience: 4 Food: 4 Service: 4"
4.0,"Overall Good Place for Buffet. Starters were really good but some of them was not cooked properly. Live Counter Foods were not good like Keema Pav and the Chats but the Jalebi was really Tasty. Coming to the Main Course all the dishes are absolutely amazing even the desserts, Which made the overall experience really good."
4.0,"Nice starters ! I was serviced by Mr Nihar. Great servicing . Ambience is nice, good deserts ! Overall a great place. It was a great afternoon with family!"
5.0,The ambience is very comforting. Parvez and Mr. Jamal were very supportive.Amritsari bharwari tangi was awesome as well as murg- taf taftan was delicious for starters.
5.0,"The one thing they have really worked on is there hospitality it is at par now. The Staff has become extra courteous and value your opinion. Parwez was super helpful in finalising our dishes and concerned about our taste throughout the meal. The one thing they need to work on is there veg dishes, there is a whole lot of scope to improve and non veg dishes are yum. Great work Sultans Of Spice but please work on veg dishes especially paneer."
5.0,"Really good place for a ""sit back and chill"" kind of experience... highly Recommended for families to visit ... Perfect ambience .. Rich collection of menu... And a really swift service ...

5.0,Awesome place and good choice for one who loves spicy food. Ambiance was really really good.staffs were courteous and ready to serve. We ordered achari paneer and lasuni daal and taste was awesome. Bit costly but worth it.
3.0,"We came here recently for a dinner and the first thing that caught our attention was the decor. The place is quite plush and royal giving you that mughal feeling.  Coming to the food, we ordered the mango meridian for drinks and it was a bit of an acquired taste. The dahi kebabs on the other hand were really good while the veg biryani ( yes we are vegetarian) was really full of flavour !!  Overall the food was really good and it's a really nice outlet to visit if you have those mughlai cravings every once in a while.  #biriyani #vegetarian #food #review #sultan #mughlai"
3.0,"I have been to this place with a friend to have a buffet around noon. the food was normal and the waiters did nothing to brief us about the dishes , other that that its a nice quiet place . food-3/5 seevice-3/5 ambience-3/5"
3.0,Non veg main course are disappointing. Starters are good and veg options are also good. Something soups and main course needs to be improved.
4.0,"Ambience is great, music and food as well.. Servicing is quick.. Parwez was too good and very kind to customers.  Food was too good and the music especially create a very calm and pleasant environment for a family fine dine"
4.0,"One quite and comfortable place to have family dinner. The food is quite tasty and I like the tandoori chicken and afghani mutton curry. They have quite interesting names for the dishes and have different style of cooking each one. The ambience is fine dinning. Also I feel the rates are quite high but overall it's a nice place for people who wants to sit,talk and enjoy food."
5.0,Food was very good service was excellent we enjoyed name name tapas  was very very good. It is a must place to visit you are going to love the food
5.0,"I had a nice family dinner at this place. The service is amazing, with a polite staff. Worth the money. Gajar halwa ki seekh is a must. Liquid pan was a nice surprise."
4.0,"The restaurant ambience was good. The non veg as well as veg starters were awesome. Dahi ke kabab was amazing. Spinach, tomato and Cheese shorba was mind blowing too. Pakore ke tokri was not as we expected very limited variety and nothing special. The veg main course was on a bit of down side. Angari murg kabab was very good. Rumali roti needs improvement though. I loved Mutton keema biryani the most for main course and i a must try. They have valet parking as road in front is a complete no parking zone. The service was prompt and very good. The also offer good suggestions about food if you ask. I would like visit again for sure."
2.0,"average food, poor service(very slow), ambience is just ok.. would not suggest anyone.. its like paying huge amount for very average quality food."
5.0,"we all went here for a farewell party of our associate. Fully satisfied with the buffet. in fact, till next day i have not had anything . its too good. yummy... lot of starters.."
3.0,"It was the weekend and a day of irregular eating - we wanted some authentic North Indian and we visited Sultans of Spice. Using my Zomato Gold, we ordered cocktails but they were really bad - too sugary, bad presentation! The starters were decent and he service was good. The main course options looked good but upon eating gave us the feeling that they were not entirely fresh (no after effects though). Despite this, I genuinely enjoyed the dal makhani and naan, and the aloo tiki chaat from the live counter!"
4.0,"It's a good place for buffet, chats was nice It will be nice if u include more barbeque items than fried ones  Desserts are also good, overall a good place."
3.0,Just Hyped ! Nothing Great  Food is below Average . Believe me no need to even check out this place . Service is also not that great . Bad experience
5.0,Another restaurant tick boxed...  The flavours that these people provided were truly authentic and reminded us of the taste from Punjabi restaurants of Delhi...  The best part was that they packaged the left over food for us...  The pan shots at the end of the dinner were icing on the cake...  Special mention to Mr. Balram for his polite and exceptional service...
2.0,The spread was too less and the taste was not so extraordinary. Was disappointed with the food. The staffs were good. They must work on the taste part now.
4.0,"For a buffet, it's great. Some dishes tasted great! Some were just alright. Huge variety of Starters and Desserts but not much in the main course section (buffet only). Otherwise, great ambience and a great staff. Will definitely visit again."
3.0,"Sultans of spice.. A decent place located at Kormangala, easy to locate.. the ambience goes well with the name. We have been here in a weekend for lunch buffet.  Ambience and service is the best here. The serving people are too polite and friendly, prompt in service.  Now coming to the main part, the food... Umm No... It was not at all upto the mark compared to the buffet price. The taste of the food is too normal, less than the normal standard. Both veg and nonveg starters were not satisfying to start with a good impression. In main course there was hardly anything which you can happily go for.. I would still give it a 3* only for the sake of deserts. There's a wide range of deserts with really yummm taste. Also a good range of salads for those who are health freaks   Though it was not very much satisfying but thanks to Zomato Gold, we could have a happy ending  We could get drinks 1+1 free and it was good enough to leave the place with a smile on face."
5.0,"This place is worth a visit. Food is amazing, very welcoming staff. The buffet especially is worth savoring. Nihar is extremely friendly. Thank you."
4.5,Visited the place recently. The place is quiet spacious . Food is good. Biryani was just upto mark.  Mr Parvez provided an awesome service. That is for what I am giving the rating.
4.0,nice menu.. Great service.. nice ambience..Polite staff.. Great options for Vegetarians..tasty and not too spicy.. definitely will be visiting again..
1.0,"Serving was poor, starters were cold & some of the starters were stale. Foods were too spicy. Waiters were fools. Options were less. We went for family lunch but were disappointed"
4.0,"I must say that no place in Bangalore serves such amazing sheekh kebabs. Being loaded with varieties of sultan and Punjabi cuisine, this place is gonna win your taste buds for sure. I had aam Panna and sheekh kabab to start my dinner with, both of them were outstanding. I tried ghost ki nalli with khameeri roti, which is worth trying. I rarely get to have such soft piece of lamb on my plate. Besides these, a classic ambiance with royal flavour is something waiting for you."
4.5,"Good quality chicken, nicely cooked with all the flavours intact. Place is a good find for mughalai lovers. Such resturant isnt easy to find in a place like Bangalore."
4.0,"A soothing and peacefull ambience with light music gives a simple yet enjoyable time well spent while having the delicious food. Both A-la-cart and buffet options are available. Mine was a-la-cart with my office team. The mushroom and chicken tangdi bharwa were so juicy and paneer muglai and chicken tikka gravies were well suited with panner stuffed naan for our taste buds. Last but not the least, anjeer lassi was rich in nutrients due to its thick consistency and abundance of anjeer and other dry fruits. Love to visit again."
5.0,"Been here a couple of times, once for their buffet lunch, and the other for dinner! Beautiful and comfortable ambience! The food is always great. The service and staff are noteworthy!!! Absolutely wonderful service. If you plan to have some nice mughlai food during weekends without the loud music of a typical eatery, this is definitely the place to go."
4.0,"We went for a weekend lunch with family and that was my first visit to this place. The restaurant ambience and the taste of buffet food was very good. Especially we loved the taste of the starters and gravy. Surprisingly my mother in law who never enjoys outside food, loved the taste. The volume of the songs played can be reduced so that the ambience can be enjoyed further. Definetly would suggest to my friends."
5.0,"It is always a pleasure to visit Sultans of Spice with friends and family. Great food, courteous staff, peaceful ambience. Wat else can one ask for  Highly recommended. Love their menu and choice of dishes and Love their lunch buffet spread."
5.0,Good food and great ambience. Nihar and jamwal delivered a great service along with great collection of food. The drinks collection were also great including the mocktails and the cocktails.
5.0,Amazing ambience and main course. Had a great time with my friends and Nihar & Jamal were excellent in their service ! Looking forward to visiting again.
5.0,"Ambience, Food and staff at site of SOS excelled with flying colours and met our expectations.  Ambience is brilliant, well decorated with arts and good blend of colors.  We were served with welcome drink Aam Panna. That was pretty good.  Starters : There were plenty of options in both Veg and NV, and loved the available options.  In non veg Kalmi Kabab, Fish, Chicken Dahi Kabab and mutton seekh. Spice was perfect as well. I don't eat prawn so I will take my colleagues word that it was one of the best Tawa Prawn he had in recent times.  In Veg starters, liked Paneer tikka, papdi gullar, Banjara seekh, tandoori aaloo. Generally I loved having grilled pineapples at BBQ so reluctantly tried here but to my pleasent surprise, it was tasty.  Live Counters - Tried Raj Kachori Chat, Dahi Bhalle and Keema Paav. Raj Kachori and Keema Paav were one of the best I had in recent times.  Main-Course - Laal Mirch Mutton, Egg Curry and Chicken Biryani were yummy.  Dessert - Problem of Plenty here. Tried Gulab Jamun, Pineapple Custard and Halwa and loved it. Also decent ice cream and sweet cake option.  More often than not, we were served on time and would love to call out Deep for his courtesy and quickness.  Overall had a great time here with friends who gave the experience a big THUMBS UP."
4.0,Went there for lunch on a weekday with colleagues. A bit of fine dine resturant with buffet options as well. The food is good but the choises are a bit limited. The veg starters had 6-7 options and same for non veg. Enjoyed Garam jalebi with Rabri.
4.0,nice food and courteous service...  They use to serve one of the best mutton chops. However now they are not.. That's why 1 less star  apart from this all good..
5.0,"I went to Sultan of Spice today on dinner with my family, it was my first visit to Sultan of Spice and the experience was very good. Staff is very courteous and helpful there is one attendant Santosh who was very enthusiastically serving us and took good care of us, thanks to him and the entire staff."
5.0,"celebrated daughter birthday and it was just an amazing experience. Thanks to Manoj and his team, hospitality, food, ambience could not be better. we opted for lunch buffet and everything from fruits, starters, main course and desserts were just awesome. we asked for less spicy and mayonnaise and what not, everything was provided. service was just amazing. Thanks so much for memorable experience :)"
4.0,"Went for team lunch.Located in the prime area inside the blue petal hotel.The ambience and seating facility is good. The main highlight of the buffet was the awesome chats.We all loved the chats , it was very fresh and tasty we kept on having it.The non veg soup was not good.The starters were decent but could add some more innovations to it.The Fish starter was tastySalad spread was good and the main course was good as well.The roti basket was soft and tasty with the murgh curry.The desert was another highlight , even though it was usual desserts u get in any buffet, it all was very delicious.                                                                 bellyburp.wordpress.com"

4.0,"Went there for team lunch. Staff's were very polite and were very prompt to cater to our needs. Food was also good not very good, not very bad. Had a nice experience."
4.0,"I have been to this place thrice.... The food was decent all the times... even though they serve buffet during lunch hours, they still served orders from a la carte menu pretty quickly...."
3.0,seemed like an overdose of food. was there for a family dinner. starters were amazing. but the remaining food disappointed me. The service was pretty good though!
2.0,I visited this place with my team today in kormangala for team lunch .My overall experience was pathetic food-2/5 location-5/5 starters-2/5 desserts-3/5
1.0,"We visited the place on 11/04/2018 , place has a bit nice ambience.  It was a regretful experience to visit here. Taste of food was not good. First time I came across such a limited non veg menu. Only 3 items.  The setback for our whole team was the service . They delayed the orders continuously.  Summary -  1. Taste - pathetic, even rice was half cooked. 2. Service - pitiful, 3 Management - irresponsible and negligent .  I do not recommend this restaurant."
5.0,Easily one of the finest Mughal delicacies served here. I think I tasted one of the best Biriyanis in Bengaluru at this place. Mutton Keema and their mocktail blends are also very tasty. Above all excellent service. Best place to have lunch or dinner with family.
5.0,"This place has a very beautiful set up and is extremely clean. There are staff members by the name Parwez, Balram and Nehar, who were courteous, kind and patient.   We opted for buffet and definitely weren't disappointed. The food provided was delightful and flavoursome.   Safe to say, it's worth every penny."
5.0,"awesome food, delightful service, pleasant people Jamal Parwez and aaragya awesome service. thanks. will sugest to friends and family. definite yes place"
4.0,Nice place. The staff are very cordial. The food was very tasty. They should increase the non veg Main dish variety.I would this place. The cocktails we're very nice.
5.0,"Food was delicious, nice ambience. Like the service of Balram. It was a nice experience. We enjoyed the music along with our food. Like the taste of spices. Would like to come again"
3.5,"Went to this place for a team lunch. The ambience is great and it is in accordance with Sultan in the name of the place. Coming to the food, I found the buffet to be ordinary. There were quite a lot of choices among the starters, main course and desserts. The starters were mediocre, the main course and desserts were good. Overall I was satisfied with the experience but definitely the food could've been better."
4.5,"Location 4.5/5 Ambiance 4/5 Service 5/5 Food 4/5 Value for money 4.5/5  Visited Sultans of Spice today with 2 hungry and sleepy kids. To be frank, that is a real test of service for any restaurant. We started with Badam Chicken Shorba, which was a bit bland and not to kids liking. Elder one promptly gave a vocal feedback - ""it's not good"". Nihar (our serving staff) took this as an opportunity to and offered us whatever she wants to have. Elder one made a tough wish, which was graciously fulfilled. They delighted a customer who wasnt happy at all.   Overall ambiance is cozy and spacious. Ambient music is soothing with decoration enhancing North Indian / Western cuisine. Choice of teal color in furnishing was very good. Open kitchen makes it easy for those extra cautious with hygiene.   Stuffed Mushroom tikka starter was exceptional. Masala cola nimbu and lemonade were average. For main course, we went for Kadai Veg and Dal Sultani. Dal was  simmered on slow flame and tasted great. Veggie was above average but was a bit dry. Roti basket was sufficient for 3 adults and had a nice variety.  I found the quality of service exceptional at Sultans of Spice with special mention to manager Arghya and serving staff Nihar.All kids were offered balloons and there was a wide spread of mouth fresheners before exit.   2 suggestions to improve -  1)Menu is quite limited and more dishes could be added. For e.g. there is only 1 mushroom gravy in main course.   2) There is just one unisex toilet, which seemed like a crunch in a place like this.   Very happy with overall experience. I am going to be a regular here. See you guys around.Sheetal Gupta Ashesh Agarwal"
5.0,"very nice food. everything was perfect and tasty. it was the best buffet I visited.very good ambience. staff named Balram,depjoti and Santosh served very good and perfectly."

5.0,"Great ambience, great food quality and variety. Nihar and his team really make us feel at home. Highly recommended for family and office lunch n dinner. Thanks to Salio for her friendly n welcoming service"
4.0,"Visited Sultan's for the first time for lunch and I wasn't disappointed. I liked the ambience, nicely lit and comfortable seating. The starters were pretty good especially fish. Prawns could have been better. Main course(non-vegetarian) had less dishes, not that I am complaining but whatever they had was alright. There is Delhi chat, Keema-Pav etc available for those wanting the street food flavour on the menu. I liked the lavish spread of desserts and loved Gajar ka halwa. More than the food I loved the service at the restaurant, very decent, smiling, available and helpful staff at all times. They even prepared a small portion of chicken dish for my kid who doesn't eat spicy food. Thanks a lot for the gesture.will definitely visit again."
4.0,Good one. I had been there for my bday dinner and it was a pleasant experience. They were coordinated to plan the bday surprise for me with my friends. Friendly staff and they keep ensuring that you are comfortable and happy with the food and service.
5.0,Best place for Indian Cuisine. Awesome Vegetarian dishes and a great variety of non vegetarian food... absolutely amazing! I have been coming here for 3 years now and this place never fails to impress
5.0,it was nice to be back here. good food and taste is also good. specially staff balraam and tapas was very good.his behavior was too good.ambiance was very good.
4.0,"Went there for a lunch buffet with office colleagues. The decor of the place is impressing and seating is nice and comfortable. The place is inviting the staff is courteous.  The starters are served at your seat on request based on the menu of the day.  Though you are not spoil't for choices but the spread is balanced. I would expect more options in a buffet. In terms of flavors and taste- most of starters do justice and would not disappoint you. The main course was also balanced in terms of offering and as most buffet places had nothing extra ordinary.   Talking about my favorite part of the buffet- Desserts. Enjoyed the hot jalebi's and the chilled Rabri. The limited spread was   again a disappointment and there was nothing extraordinary. You do not expect to have 4 normal ice cream flavors on a buffet menu without variations.Taking nothing away from the restaurant , the quality of the food and ambiance was good but fell sort of my expectation in terms of the offerings in term of variety.If you are looking at variety Buff Buff buffet on the ground floor of same compound has a better offering  Food-4/5Ambiance- 4.5Service- 5/5Variety-3/5"

4.5,"BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER. Hands down, no questions asked.  Came here with my mom and sister and here's what we ordered:  1. Prawn tandoori 2. Chicken Tikka 3. Paneer Tikka 4. Makkhani Black Daal 5. Chicken curry 6. tandoori parantha 7. Garlic Naan 8. Steamed Basmati Rice  Every single dish was outstanding! If I had to choose my top 3 dishes to order they would be the Prawn ,Chicken Tikka, and Black Daal. But honestly, you cannot go wrong with any dish you order! The Prawn was so crisp and fresh and the chutney was unlike any I've ever had! I was so obsessed. Both theChicken Tikka and makkhani Daal were so flavorful and rich in the best way. The chicken in the Chicken Tikka was tender and juicy and cooked so nicely.  The service here is fantastic and the ambiance is very fun and trendy. If you have not been here before and you're visiting Banglore, SOS is a must! My family and I arrived here around 7.30pm and waited for about an hour! Apparently the wait is much longer near dinner time so if you're flexible I would definitely come as early as possible! Would love to come back to SOS the next time I am in town."
4.5,"Really good fine dine for north Indian cuisine, we ate all vegetarian food, and everything was delicious , we ordered vegetarian platter for 6 ppl and it felt like a whole course meal, so the quantity was good, staff was really helpful special Nihar and santoosh. Thumps up for ur service."
3.0,"Had been here for team lunch . Buffet spread was good . Starters was good , main course did not enjoy much , found mutton curry was stale and cold . Deserts was good ..ambience is ok. Service is ok."
3.5,"I had picked up this place for my birthday celebrations and yes it was a pretty good pick.! The setting in there is so mesmerizing.. Just fell in love with the ambience!. The food part was good enough!. They have some lip-smacking starters in their menu. The main course went okay for me as i had ordered paneer tikka multani which was told to be sweet but had taste of some other world!. The non-veg dishes though were great!. They offer mocktails in good variety and were great as well except that ""sunshine"" one that worked as a great spoiler!. Desserts were good. Service was good enough!. Felt a little untrained staff but still thier attitude and courteousness was well on mark!. Overall a place one should must try in koramangala!.

4.5,"Most ultimate place to have food over here with friends, family and office team. Food and buffet is ultimate. I gave 0.5 less rating, because I wanted to try a fish which was not available over here.. Moreover if you come to ambience and staff is too good."
4.0,"Tried the buffet on Sunday at SOS. They have a compact spread which always I like gives one the ability to reflect on the flavour of what's in front, has a mix of dals, paneer , chicken and mutton dishes. Found the mutton to be wonderfully cooked after a long time in a place in Bangalore. They have a chaat stall where the talented dude sends out the usual plates of chaat but also serves up a devil of a keema Pav, went completely destructive on this serving, kalmi kababs and the mutton seekhs are beautifully done as well. Will return for part deux highly recommended."

Parvez and Jamal was enquiring on the need every time they pass by. Liked food spread apart from Fish Tikka which was blunt as Deep fry. Starters/Biryani/Mutton/Desserts were really good. Aam ka panna and Pan Shot made the start and end with their signature Glass.  Food 4.5/5 Ambience 4/5 Service 4.5/5 VfM: 4.5/5"

4.0,"Sunday noon , three of us went for Sultans of Spice buffet . We liked it, as the food taste really good. We were served with aam panna as welcome drink, which has a scope of improvement. We were served with 7 veg starters and 5 non veg starters at our table. Live counter had 3 veg and 2 non veg dishes.All of us loved the keema pav. Keema pav stole the show. Tangdi chicken was awesome. Mutton kabab , tawa fish, prawn and chicken seekh were also good. All the veg starters were yummy. I especially loved veg starters. They had around 6-8 salads, dahi bhalle and curd rice. In the live counter, we got garam jalebi with rabdi and falooda.  In the main course for non veg, mutton in red gravy was lipsmacking. Butter prawns were superb and biriyani was considerably good. Chicken was not spirit lifting though it tasted good with butter roti. I was little unhappy with the main course for veg, as i personally didnt find anything enticing from the menu. The veg menu had corn pulao, basmati rice , dal tadka, gobi adraki, paneer kofta , and 2 more items.  Dessert was good as well. We loved langcha, orange malai roll and brownie. They had lawki ka halwa, pastry, pineapple moose, cut fruits and 4 varieties of icecream. Chocolate icecream needs improvement. At the end we got Paan shots.  The ambience is good. Staff is really courteous. Proper north indian restaurant. I totally loved it as it was paisa wasool. We went for early bird offer at Rs 680 inclusive of taxes."

4.0,"So we were veg today and we thought  to give Sultan of Spices a try.. i hv been here before, but being a non veg lover, never tried veg cuisine.. so let me tell you they hv good veg buffet on weekdays..we were served by Nihar and they hv good staff. Food is good, large spread for veg too.. Thanks!"
5.0,The food is really good. The service too. The place seems to be really good in terms of ambiance. Had a good lunch. The buffet options are limited but. @Nihar thank you
4.5,"Lovely place to catch up with your friends and family. Service was good so the ambiance. Starters were really yummy. Only problem was waiters kept on coming without pace, forcing us to eat and request them to slow down. Soup wasn't that great which was compensated by their Salad spread and main course. Waiters were courteous as well, when one of my friend with 4 eyes dropped a plate, they smilingly cleaned the mess with a broad smile. People came before us and after us, had their lunch and left but we were still there talking, they didn't chase us:) big thumps up. Single unisex washroom was like ""want to pee, hop in the Queue""."
4.5,"Good food, nice ambience, friendly staff,  Good variety of starters and desserts, lot of options for non vegetarians......................................... Nihal"
4.5,I went to Sultans of Spice and opted for their lunch buffet. They have great spread and the food was simply fantastic. Ive been to very few places in Bangalore that have such amazing Indian food. The ambiance is not too fancy but trust me the food and service makes up for it. This place is a MUST TRY.

5.0,"In one word Awesome experience!! I had been there on my Birthday, which was actually a surprise from my hubby. It really turned out to be a memorable one with the delicious food and ambiance we had. As it was a weekday, there was no crowd (which we definitely enjoyed, as all the focus and attention was on us..:) )..jokes apart, when I entered the environment was so so positive and nice...then Mr. Nihar who was one of those who was serving with utmost dedication and attention. I must say he was very well behaved and though all the attenders were. Now coming to Food: Starter: We took Galuti Kabab, it was nice tempting, soft and the taste is above the sky (I had never liked galuti kabab so much after had it in once in Pune, but this was brilliant than the one i could ever think of) Main - Course - we have Butter Naan, Butter Roti and Chicken Tikka Masala( This is also one of the must try dishes) Please visit and taste the authentic Sultani Spice.."

4.0,"Blue petal is a well known hospitality brand at JNC road 5th block Koramangala. They have their Indian speciality restaurant called as Sultan of spices and they are truly.  In a weekday dinner I have tried their delicacies usually they serve buffet in lunch and a la carte in dinner.  Tikka Ras Monak in Starters good in taste. Murg Shorba - average. Dal Veg Shorba - was well prepared. Dum Wala old monk Chicken wings - something new they tried old monk lovers will love for sure. Prawn lollypop - what a innovation instead of poltry bone they used sugar cane stick. But they have to adjust the spice as well.

5.0,"Was crowded when I arrived. Although I had a booking, Had to wait for about 40 mins. But I got to say, The Food was Worth the the Wait. Loved the rabdi jalebi and orange roll."
4.0,"Authentic and delicious. This is our second visit here, so far we have tried some breads and rice varieties and all of them have been really authentic and been cooked to perfection. The veg biryani is better than many other restaurants and is slightly spicy, but tastes pretty good overall. I would suggest to try dum aloo and amritsari naan. Very satisfied with the food and the service."
2.5,I have been to a number of buffets but not as disappointing as this. Every buffet has a few dishes that make you happy but this turned out to be a never ending waiting game.
4.5,"This place has the best buffet spread ever!! Even better than some of the famous buffet places like BBQ nation and Flechazo. I have enjoyed all their starters, which is too many of them, and its hard to point to one exact dish. Biryani too was good which is kinda rare when it comes to buffets!  Their dessert spread and live counter spread is heavenly. The live counter starters/fry were even better!!! There were so many options to try, I definitely missed trying some dishes on the main course! I strongly recommend people to checkout this place for buffets! Ambience is decent.  This place is usually crowded so please pre book it. Inspite of pre booking we had to wait and its very hard to wait outside when the live counter is running right next to you"
5.0,Mr. Balram.. was too gud... gud food.. service was super... yummy... loved the food.........................................................
4.5,"Food -4.5/5 Innovation in food/ Plating -4.5/5 Ambience- 4.5/5 Service -4.5/5 ( servers can improve knowledge of dishes) Price- 4/5 ( Considering fine dine-in, price was ok) Parking -4/5 ( Bike parking and valet parking available) Hygiene- 4.5/5  It won't be and understatement to say that Koramangala restaurant scene is bursting at the seams. But who is complaining when food lover are thrown with so much of variety and splurge. This restaurant is part of the Blue Petal hotel. The ground floor consists of ""Buff Buffet Buff and this particular restaurant is situated on the 4th floor of the same complex. They had offered valet parking for the folks who came in four wheeler and there is minimal two wheeler parking in the same complex. As I said this restaurant is a part of the blue Petal Hotel entrance is also inside the hotel and you have to take the lift to to 4th floor.  But however once you reach for floor the Ambience and the slow music really welcomes you into a different world of its own. I am not over stating but the entrance gate and the music and also the weeding area which can easily accommodate 8 people to sit on the nice sofas was very welcoming not just visually but also in actual sense. The restaurant is themed on North Indian and North West Frontier places and each element of the restaurant hit send very well into the scheme of the things things  First of all I would like to thank the hospitality of Mr Manoj Panjabi and the restaurant manager Mr Manoj. Not we just they were attentive to our needs but also explained the dishes in great detail. Even the Chef came time time to come and meet us and personally took the feedback of each of the dishes he prepared and how well they can be bettered.  We were welcomed with spicy yet very soothing snack of ""Mini kachori"" which were topped with tangy tamarind sauce and curd. They were simple and lip smacking.  The welcome drink was a bubbly drink which had tutti frutti at bottom and the taste was interesting when you bite on to those tutti frutti.  ""Dal Shorba"" in veg and ""Murgh Shorba"" in non veg was the soup that was served along. Dal Shorba was better of the two and when hard core non vegetarian advises a veg dish ahead of a non veg just blindly trust it, LOL! The texture and the fragrance of the Dal Shorba was perfect and it was very soothing to have it. It serves as the perfect appetizer soup. On the other hand the most Shobha did have all the elements which makes it taste good and rich but there was a zing missing in it. The whole badam pieces and shredded chicken and the light soup all seemed very distinct of each other and didn't combine into one element of lovely taste.  ""Mushroom Bharwan"" was mushroom stuffed with paneer which was grated and cooked along with lot of spices. Both this all time favourite vegetarian delight combine into 1 magical dish which almost melts in your mouth. They were prepared so nicely and so well done it was really a mesmerising experience to have it.  Just to mention here most of the dishes that were served to us where the signature dishes of the restaurants and can be easily found in the new and enhanced menu which is in place. And we were invited for experiencing this magical upliftment of the menu. Apart from the taste the plating was done really very nice with a brush of beetroot sauce on the plate. Chef who took time out of his very busy schedule in preparing this delicacies for us came and chat it over with us explaining what are his plans of further innovation onto the dishes and plating. We were really flattered by his humbleness coming from a background of a five star restaurant in Calcutta and couple of years of abroad working experience. It seems they have plans of introducing marble based plates and the Chef was very eager to play around with the dressing and plating and and he took all of her smallest of the advised very patiently and promised us that he would surely looking to them as suggestions.  Even the simplest of the ""green salad"" was served very nicely with the new dip in between the salad that was served.  ""Dum wala old monk chicken wings"" was an interesting twist to the normal chicken wing that is served. Once that dish is served on table, the waiter pours in 30 ml of Old Monk and lights fire on it. Many might say that it is just a visual appeal but that few seconds of the burn gives a very distinct twist to the very old chicken wing. This jig leaves behind a distinct sweet taste on the chicken wings which was different and I really couldn't make out if it was good or bad. But it was definitely something different and you would you like it or hate it.  ""Bharwan Chicken Kalmi Kabab"" is when meat meets meat. Minced mutton nicely cooked stuffed into chicken legs, both being nicely marinated and cooked, is bound to create explosion of sorts in mouth once you savour this meaty wonder. The spice on the chicken legs were just perfect not too strong not too less yet very juicy and wonderful to have.  ""Prawn Lolipop"" what's the second most innovative days that I had that night. I would explain the first most innovative dish later on. This was huge prawn meat that was deveined and then sprinkled with very minimal spices and then wrapped onto a small juicy and edible sugar cane stick and then deep fried. You must not miss to have a bite onto this dash with the little bit of sugar cane along. Initially the waiter didn't explain about the dish and how to eat and I was having only the prawn leaving behind the sugar cane stick until someone suggested me to have it the other way. This is one place where I felt that the waiters can be little more groomed so that they can educate and tell the customer how to have these innovative dishes which definitely has taken a lot of time patience and also perseverance of the chef and the hotel management.  ""Murg Taftan"" was soft delicate and juicy chicken pieces marinated in desi curd and cooked in a gentle Spices that made it very enjoyable to have.  ""Makai Cheese Tikka"" was nicely roasted corn and cheese made into small cutlet type pieces and served once again in a nice dressing and a plate. The tikka or the cutlet crunchy outside and soft and creamy inside. The pieces were a little too big I felt which might lead to wastage and which can be easily overcome by serving smaller and more number of pieces. Taste was no doubt good however.  ""Paneer Chatpata Roll"" was also paneer wrapped inside paneer. Outside paneer was wrapped funny and inside paneer was roasted paneer with a lot of masala. This paneer inside paneer concept was nice and that is good tickled to gave the approval of the same as well.  ""Mutton Gelloti Kabab"" was wonderfully cooked and me to the perfection exactly how I expected it to be. This dish is one of the most eaten dish north west province and it was done equally nice as you get it over there. The Kabab was hot, moist, soft and oozing with ghee with a topping of a dollop of green chutney and onion suck on a small mini size naan. You are expected to have a bite of all these elements together to have the best of the taste. And when you're sinking your teeth into this it really give you a pleasure of a different dimension. This dish was heavenly.  ""Triple Sheekh Kabab"" was a concotion of 3 different kebabs. One seemed made of beetroot. Each of the three different kebabs tasted very distinct in its own yet they were very soft and delicate to have. Not to mention the plating once again looked very colourful and delighting.  Drinks served where also nice. "" Watt a Melon"", a watermelon taste drink served along with was very refreshing and not too heavy as alcohol. ""7 Wonder"" awesome mix of seven colours drinks. I could remember Vodka Gin Sprite, soda of the 7 items. This once again tasted very nice and refreshing as well. ""Green Apple Martini"" also oozed the refreshing quotient in it. ""Pan Bailey wale"" was a drink based off on leaves and Bailey cream served in a short glass.  ""Nalli Gosht"" was yet again well marinated and well cooked juicy and delicious lamb shanks. The meat was very delicate and it was coming of the bone which is a sign of well cooked soft meat. It went perfectly well with the Roti basket served which had an assortment of butter naan, plain naan, plain roti, makai roti. I like the Makai Roti the best. The plane and butter naan were also however as per my expectation.  ""Dal Makhni"" , ""Paneer Butter Masala"" and ""Chicken Butter Masala"" not just at touch of the essential North Indian cuisine but also it tasted really authentic and rich. Chef had used a generous dose of nuts to the gravy which made the taste really exotic  ""Sarso Da Saag"" was good in taste but I felt it could have been better in terms of authenticity of taste. There seemed to be something missing. It felt little to very smooth and missed the little pungent nature of how Sarso Da Saag is. But nevermind it tasted good in companion with of Makai da roti.  ""Sultani Kofta"" who was a surprise dash which turned out to be little more exceptional then what I expected it to be. The koftas where boiled in water and not fried and so it was made with very little oil. The gravy once again was very thick and delicious and is guaranteed to give you the mmmm when you take a bite along with a morsel of a roti.  Sweet dishes as well had its own share of innovation and surprise elements.  ""Gulabo"" was a twist to the staple firni that is served with the dash of Rose essence and rose petals served in a tall Martini glass. Not to mention it was visually appealing and tasted very good as well. It was very creamy and would definitely titillate your sweet taste bud.  And last but not the least I had mentioned above 1 dish being the second best. So here comes the dish which as per me was the best in taste and innovation. It was ""Gajar Ka Halwa"" with a twist. The halwa was baked in tandoor and it was almost like a semi hard stick served on a nicely decorated plate. Chef had used generous creativity by spinning handmade Candy Floss sorts out of sugar and netting it over the gajar halwa served. It was served along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I was very much impressed with the decoration of that Candy Floss over the gajar halwa which look amazingly beautiful and taste it good too. Gajar halwa which is generally served as a soft delicacy, surprise your taste bud coming of has a hard to bite sweet delicacy.  Nevertheless I must thank Mr Manoj Panjabi, Mr Manoj from restaurant management and The Chef for the tremendous creativity and ears to suggestions and feedback. I am sure this new innovated menu can give a tough competition to even up scale restaurants and even 5 stars. Especially I loved the innovations The Chef brings in and his creativity which he doesn't try to shower on his dishes. Thank you once again and we would surely return to have rest of the 45 speciality curated dishes that you have."

Sultans of Spice is a restaurant, which specializes in North Indian food, particularly Delhi, Punjabi, and Afghani food. This place serves buffet during lunch hours and ala carte during dinner. While I am a regular customer at Buff Buffet Buffet, I heard a lot about Sultans of Spice and wanted to try this restaurant since long. The restaurant is located at a prime location on Jyoti Nivas College road in Koramangala.  I went there with my blogger/reviewer friends on a food-tasting invite. As I entered inside, I noticed that this place has a superb ambience and excellent dcor that matches with the concept very well. We were greeted very well, and the staff showed us the seating area. Meanwhile, Mr. Manoj, who is the Hotel Manager and his staff came to meet us. They told us about the concept of this restaurant and the kind of food items they serve.

4.0,"Sultans of Spice is a place maintained by Blue Petals group located in Koramangala. If you go by the food they serve, must say they are truly sultans and they understand the taste and blend of spices of north indian food really well  LOCATION  Located in the center of Koramagala, this place is very next to the Jyoti Niwas College. Parking is not a constraint as they have a valet parking. The restaurant is located on the 4th floor and is easy to find.  DRINKS  They serve some really good drinks. We tried Seven Wonders, What a Melon,Green Apple Tiny and a Paan Baileys Wala. Must say they serve really good drinks with good blend of alcohol and respective flavours. 7 Wonders is their signature drink and even Paan Baileys Wala was really unique. One suggestion will be use correct glasses for respective cocktails like cocktail glasses for martinis, highball glasses for mojitos and so on.  FOOD  We as a group had lots of options of food. We started with Murgh Badam Shorba and Dal Shorba. Honestly Murgh Badam Shorba was not upto the mark but Dal Shorba was really good. In starters we had Dum Wala Old Monk chicken wings( a concept where they sprinkle old monk over chicken wings), Prawn Lollypop, Amritsari Bharwan Taang, Murg Taftan, Makai Cheese KAbab, Chatpata Paneer Roll, Triple Seekh Kabab and chicken malai tikka. Amritsari Bharwan Taang is the best of the lot, which has a meat filling in chicken leg. The malai tikkas and kababs were really impressive. The Old Monk Winks were something unique and really good to taste.  In Main Course, we had Dal Sultani, Sarso DA Saag, Butter chicken, Nalli Ghost, Sultani Kofta and breads. As always, the Blue Petal as a group will not disappoint you with the main course. Sultani Kofta was exceptional with the koftas not fried but baked. Must Say Sarso DA Saag was really one of the best we had in the town and so was makki di roti.  Desserts are really good and unique. We had a rose phirni and a kabab made out of the gajar ka halwa which was really different and unique.  QUALITY  The quality of poultry they use is really good and you will surely get to know once you taste the stuff. The quality of veg food is also equally good and everything is freshly made in house.  AMBIENCE AND EXPERIENCE  The ambience is typical fine dine one. You can get a separate space for yourself with curtains on.  The staff is really polite and tries everything to make your food experience great.  The chef is from Delhi and has worked in esteemed places like punjab grill and hyaats  If you have any complaints over the food/drinks/others, you can easily reach out to them and they will do their best to solve the same  PRICE Prices are a little high but I am sure you will enjoy the food for such a price                                             akhilkohlifoodjourney.wordpress.com"
3.0,"Good food, nice ambience and good service. Nice place for family and friends. Quality of starters can be slightly improved, some of the starters were really bland. Wide range of deserts but again lacks quality. Service was good but we had to call the waiters and wait to get the plates cleared. After serving starters the waiters are non existent for most time unless called upon."
4.5,"Their ambience and seating is the best. Some of the best food I have had is from here. For starters we had Murg Dahi Malai Kabab and for mains afghani mutton rogan curry, steamed basmati rice and moghul chicken biryani. By the time we finished this we were so full that we had to skip dessert, definitely something we would try the next time around. All in all, definitely a place you can go with your family or colleagues and have a good bonding over some amazing food."
2.0,Been there many times for alacarte and found it really good but this time we went there for team lunch in a group of 6. Service was very slow and Food was pathetic. They had put lot of elachi in each n everything. Biryani and pulao were not well cooked.Everyone of us could feel raw rice. Curries were tasteless. Starters were pathetic as well. I suggest not to go there for buffet.  Thanks.
4.0,"Good food speacially the starters and the deserts. I think the baby corn item should have a little more salt as i felt little salty,although it was nice fo eat.Apart from that chicken dahi kabab was good. Amibience was decent and good to spend time. Overall nice place to visit."
4.0,If are a foodie then you should visit this place.ambience is nice.service is really good.they have plenty of starters including prawn and mutton though soup was not that good.in main course they have limited items.cuisine is only mughlai so main course would be limited to that.but overall it was a good experience
4.5,"Excellent food that I ever had. The mutton starter was amazing like boti shoti,. In the main course I liked Dal bhukhara, dahi wala bhunakukad, ulte tawa ka paratha.. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
4.0,"Was here with my team for buffet lunch on Friday. Surprisingly the crowd was less. Located opposite Jyoti Nivas College and in the same building as Buff Buff Buffet. The ambiance was too good.  The welcome drink was okay but the wide variety of veg and non veg starters were extremely good. Included chicken, mutton, fish and prawns. From veg they had aloo tikki, mushroom, pineapple, paneer. We can add little spice to all of them :) The Live counter was good. We literally made the counter live since there werent many ppl around in the restaurant. Jalebi with Rabdi was best among the lot. A must try. Keema with Vada Pav was just okay. Dahi poori, Paani poori, bhajiya/pakodas were too good.  Main course was okay-ish when compared with Starters.  Desserts too were good.  Food: 4.5/5 (Mainly because of starters and Live Counter) Ambiance : 4/5 Value for money : 4/5 Service : 4/5"
4.5,Perfect ambience. A very decent place to take your family along. Nice aura and music. Not too loud not too low. Food is exquisite. Amazing flavour. The price is worth the taste and time. Fee dishes can be added to the menu though.
4.5,"After a lot of confusion and research I was glad I found a perfect fine dining restaurant for a North Indian Cuisine. As it is located on a 4th floor not many people know about it but the place was truly a treasure for food lovers. Though slightly over priced but the ambience, service and food makes up for it.  We ordered Tandoori Roti, Paneer Makkhan Wala, Daal Makhni, Sultani Daal and Chicken Tikka Masala.  All the dishes were scrumptious and the helpings were fairly large. What added on to my entire experience there was the courteousness of the staff. They were really attentive towards the customers and ensured that we were comfortable with everything. As it was my friends birthday they helped us with the cake, music and even clicking pictures of us voluntarily.  Overall a great dining experience, which I wouldnt mind experiencing again."
4.0,"So, we were here for a Team Lunch. When you enter this place you'd see this huge decor that says Sultans of Spice and as soon as you enter, you'll see the royal decorations and sitting arrangements.  We opted for the usual Veg and Non-Veg lunch buffet. So for that day they had a fixed menu. The service was slow and if you order any add-ons, then you'll have to remind the staff for at least 2-3 times to get that to your table.  For deserts you'll find a good number of options. Do try chats over there and you'll find a good number for that as well.  Overall, a decent place if you want to go for buffet."
5.0,"Very good food, fresh and in good quantity as well. They truly live upto their name, spicy as sultan. Ambiance is of class. Truly loved the food and atmosphere. Hospitality is really nice, staff is friendly and humble, food service is quick and fresh. Thank you making our lunch."
4.0,"Heard a lot about this place for its Buffet and finally I made to visit the place. This place sets your mood for a royal ambience like mughal and Afghan style 4/5. Different cuisine Buffet in one place both veg n non veg.  Veg starters-Paneer tikka, Mushroom fry, baby corn cheese kebab and veg seekh kabab 4/5. Non veg-Mutton chops, Chicken legs,tava jhinga,fish tikka and mutton seekh kababs was the best 5/5.   Main course - Chicken Biryani was nice 3/5.  Desserts- Gazar Ka halwa, Gulab jamun 4/5.  Overall- Excellent service,Staff was courteous. Value for money.  I would recommend to someone if you are looking for a budget buffet place."
5.0,It's a great day at sultans of spice.... True taste of food can be found here... It's a wow experience... Good quality... Best service and awesome ambience
3.5,"Recommended by Zomato for North Indian Casual Dining. Booked a table for 10 pax. Interiors and ambience was perfect for a family dinner. Service was also upto the mark. Since we ordered for 9 pax, the list was huge - Veg and Non Veg Platter with 4 pints of beer, Litchi Cocktail, Lime Soda and a Red wine. For Mains Chicken Biryani, Butter and Garlic Naan, Chicken Curry, one Kala Daal, Mushroom masala. Taste wise Platter was best in the lot.  But it was pretty expensive. INR 8.5k was the bill Amount. Another pinching experience was they have served burnt Naans, on request they have replaced. Overall it was a good experience!"
5.0,"The ambiance was nice and one of the best place for buffet :)   The starters were pretty decent and tasty. We like Prawn , fish , Tanduri CHk.... the most  And the main couse attraction was the Mottom curry and kulcha.   The best was the desert. Loved the Dahi Kachodi from the live counter.  Staff's were courteous and behave  decently. We like the way one of the staff (Balaram) deal with us from begining to end.  Ambience: 5/5  Food: 5/5  Service: 5/5  Value for money: 5/5"
1.5,Yesterday we took a takeaway and specifically asked the person taking the order to make it less spicy but I think they ensured it should be more spicy .The sason Da saag was full of chillies.very disappointing experience.we pay so much price for the food and end up getting such quality food.
4.5,"Amidst classic royal decoder u can enjoy some mouth watering delicacies.............. It was probably the best buffet I ever had, affordable yet u relish the food..............Must try the keema pav and do not miss the dessert"
5.0,#Sultansofspice been to this restaurant recently and have very good ambience staff is good and they are decent. Had not veg buffet for lunch. Taste is delicious and mouth watering. Deserts are good too especially chocolate halwa.
4.5,"Amazing place .. beautiful ambience , attentive staff and great buffet . Worth the money !! Service was up to the mark . The ajwani paneer Tikka are a must try.Overall a great place !"
4.5,Sultans of spice is the one of the best restaurants when it comes to North Indian food. 5 out of 5 stars for badam murg ka shorba and murg angaar tikka.They top my list of favourites.Ambience is lovely with beautiful and decorative interiors.Management is really very nice and attentive.Worth trying!!
4.0,"Its conveniently situated in Koramangala 5th Block - Hotel BluPetal. The decor and its soothing/sophisticated/classy ambience are the key features of Sultans of Spice.  The restaurant is spacious and has beautifully decorated indoors, well quilted seats with ample seating capacity.  They have a load of buffet option to go about.   Went for a buffet and need to mention food was heavenly, beautiful blend of aroma and spices. The Dessert section had an assortment of Pastries, Ice Cream and Sweets.  Service was brisk , staffs were courteous and the food - scrumptious.  In nutshell, it was an admirable experience with the restaurant and the food (obviously). Recommended !!"
5.0,Very good mughlai food. Great for dinners. The Ambiance is excellent and the service is also very fast and good. The food is served very hot and the roti's were not rubbery
5.0,Good food and very helpful staff.. the place ambience is decent and the service is really nice. They keep and track of our comfort and clean place.
4.5,"After a long time, I seem to have found a place that has managed to strike the right balance between oil, spice, and taste in food. We had gone here for dinner last night and ordered aloo mutter cheese kurkure, dum aloo punjabi, kabuli naan, makki di roti, and anda purdah biryani. The gravy of dum aloo punjabi was almost heavenly; nothing out of the ordinary about the kabuli naan. The andah purdah biryani was quite unique in that an egg omlette ""purdah"" was used to cover the biryani. Good food - less oil, moderate spice levels, great taste - and a nice ambiance to enjoy it."
3.0,"This is indeed under the category of ""value for money"". I would recommend to someone if you are looking for a budget buffet place with an okay taste food. Was disappointed with the juice though as it was not fresh which I reported to the management. Rest you can go here for their desert items."
4.5,Food 5* Ambience 4.5* Cost 4.5* Service 5*  Amazing place for a long time pending meet. Spent about 4hrs here. Buffet was great Starters and desserts were outstanding
4.5,"Very Good ambience, staff is courteous(looks for the feedback of every dish you order). We ordered chatpate paneer roll as starter and then  Dum aloo and Achari naan as main course. All the dishes were very tasty. Only thing that I found needs improvement is the pan shot, it was not even close to the one provided by Punjab grill. Will surely visit again !!"
5.0,Food : 10/10 Ambience : 8/10 Service : 9/10  If your looking for typical northern flavor just come n try the dishes here. I personally recommend instead of menu ask the chef Mr. Vikas Bhatt and he will surprise your taste bud tht u get addicted of this place food.   Must try rara mutton. Seekh kabab. Etc etc :-)
5.0,Ambiance good food good service. Specially Arindam Ganguly restaurant manager was very helpful. He has handled total restaurant alone while the restaurant was full of guests.
5.0,"The ambience is superb, great hospitality and the food is really yummy... the buffet is a must try...we almost had 2 plates of tandoor pineapple..its so yummy..in the end they serve pan shots which is a unique way of ending the buffet.."
4.5,Very Pleasant ambiance. Great range of starters even for vegetarians and spice lovers. Nice service. There was no hurry in serving variety of starters. Great experience overall. #sultansofspice
4.5,"An amazing place for all the Mughlai and Punjabi food lovers. The food is delicious out here and the ambiance is chic. The service is great too, the chef especially comes and greets which is very impressive. If you are a non vegetarian then do try Dahiwala Bhuna Murg and in desserts Jalebi with Rabdi is a must try as they serve it hot. This is a place which I keep visiting because of the food and service and I hope you will too."
5.0,Awsm plc to dinning. .vry good foood........................and the staff at vry good. ...they suggest us what we hv to tst.... ....I would like to visit again
5.0,"""Sultan's Of Spice"" Buffet lunch is exceptional,We had a group lunch today. They serve's the plenty of delicious starter's which is lip smacking and mouth watering. I have been visited more than twice and the dining experience was extra-ordinary. Kudos to the management and many thanks to the Crew to take care of us. I truly suggest everyone a must visit restaurant in koramangala."
2.5,"You'll start having a royal feel from the entrance itself. Coming to the point directly, the food is tasty enough undoubtedly. Coming to the demerits- you will not be satisfied from their services(too late and unprofessional), you might have to guide them what to do, how to do. Very disappointing management. The only thing that kept my cool is their ""Amritsary Punjabi lassi""(delicious). I would think twice before visiting the place again. The food won't disappoint you but their services will."
3.0,"I went there on my birthday dinner. First of all interiors and ambience is too soothing and is a visual treat. Food there is delicious, we ordered some 4 starters and 3 main courses but the reason why Im giving this place a 3 star is its service. I blog food on Instagram and Ive been to so many places but the food took forever to be served here which was far from my expectation. Im not coming here again. But if you have an hour to waste, sure this place is for you.  And yes we got a complementary cake! So kudos to that. Follow @khaaoaurkhaanedo on Instagram for more lip smacking reviews. Thank you."
4.5,I loved the food here. Ambience is amazing as well. Staff was courteous. They looked fwd to the feedback. Asked for specific instructions as well. That's rare. Do try the mushroom starter. It was so yum just melts in the mouth. After eating that I started ordering mushroom everywhere I went but could not find any who could match the taste. Totally going back here!                                                                 littlefoodiegirl.com
5.0,This was my second time but to try out ala-carte menu. Must say i was once again bamboozled by their variety of authentic dilli and afghani cuisines. Starters were simply amazing which included their malai bharwan paneer tikka and dahi bhalla. Main course was just excellent. All their wide spread of bread was just awesome. Now last but not the least the desert was just simply mouth watering especially hot jalebis with rabdi. Recommend everyone to visit this place. Service - excellent Ambience - beautiful Food quality - superb
5.0,Great food and prompt service. Ensures a delightful meal.  The service staff were alert and open to suggestions and they were consistently checking on us. The chef too was very helpful and altered the tastes to our liking. Defenitely worth a try. #sultansofspice
1.0,"I visited the restaurant on Friday with family. Though the restaurant was empty, still the service was very poor, needs repeated calls and the served food was cold. I wish I could give them less than 1, but don't have option.  Food taste is below average and menu doesn't give you much variety/choices."
5.0,Good buffet options and dessert. Ambience is good and staff is courteous. Veg n non veg dishes are good with different flavors n taste. Must visit.
4.5,"Buffet here has nice varieties in both veg n non veg. Mutton chops, mushroom,papad roll, tava jhinga and fish tikka I liked most. Other chicken and veg starters very good too. Lichi lemonade as welcome drink was fresh. Couldn't had main course as I was full with starters only, main course also has multiple choices. Greek salad and chicken salad was good. Coming to dessert as it's my favourite, gazar ka halwa, gulab jamun, chocolate mousse,barfi was nice, there were other items too. Live counters of chat has Keema pav. All in all service is too good and so is the food. #sultanofspices"
2.5,Same old masala on appetizers. The worst prawn starter i ever had. How can you screw up prawns ? Hospitality was average. All in all not a good place to have buffet.
3.0,"1. Food - very average (Nothing compared to all the Barbecue leaders out there]2. Food Variety/Choices - Average to Good. 3. Service - Very poor. Needs repeated calls, many items didn't arrive second time. Welcome Drink came when we were about to go for Main-Dish after the starters. The drink was very bad.4. Ambience - Pretty decent, will look even better at night5. Location - Very well known location but traffic can be a huge hassle, thank god valet parking is availableOverall, 3 Stars [Apologies, was not able to post more photos, went with team]"
4.0,"With a great interior comes this restaurant at the Blue Petal hotel in front of JNC college, Kormangala.  Ambiance: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Staff courtesy: 5/5 (they will keep feeding you till you burst) lol :D Food: 4/5 (non-veg) is delicious  The sad part, no dinner buffet."
3.5,"I have tried Home delivery as well as dining experience though delivery always took more than an hour but still i liked the restaurant just because of their food. There north Indian food menu specially non veg one is really extensive as well as tasty. This is a team that knows it's business. A wide ranging menu, almost all dishes prepared and served to perfection, well-trained and courteous staff, pleasant ambience and prompt service to top it all.  I personally like there Nihari, do not compare it with old delhi but yes one of the nice place to have it in bangalore."
4.0,"Authentic and the chefs here have taken the word seriously as they bring the finest of Afghani and North Indian dishes to your table. The ambience welcomes you like it is supposed to and you get the pleasantness of a baarat. Staff need a little improvement in hospitality as it took nearly 10 mins for them to recognise we were waiting and searching for waiters to place an order. Food was made as it has to be and some very good items are Mirchi tangdi kebab, garlic naan, castha aaloo, tandoori pinapple, kasturi murgh, murgh biryani, All the chat station items. Desserts could be a little better but the mousse was really out of the world."
5.0,Great food... Great ambience.. Loved the place and food... Esp the garlic butter naan... And the welcome drink(Aam panna)..... There was a delay in the soup...but the overall experience was pretty satisfying and fulfilling..
5.0,Perfect place for north indian food...full of spices in proper proportion...yummy n delicious dishes... pan shot is awesome...must try food!! Will visit soon :)
5.0,Awesome food and service by Akash Yadav. He is very humble and proactive. I really appreciate the way he attained us. Thank you.  #sultansofspice
5.0,Few items are too good .... chole tikki In veg curry .. paneer tikka masala as i remember name ... was amazing ... i would like to go frequently ... service... staff all decent
5.0,Awesome food.Best place to arrange family party and dine outs.Great service and food quality was beyond our expectations.Really had fun time.Must try:Dahi Chicken Kabab
3.5,I was looking at the Buffet collection of zomato and this one popped up. I went for lunch buffet and the experience was kind of mixed. The range is just around ok and one will not find some of the unconventional offerings like many fine dine buffets have started putting up. Price is just reasonable. Location is kormangala so nothing else to add. They have Valet parking so taking a 4 wheeler should'shouldn't be an issue.  Talking about food  Starters- Chicken starters were good. Seekh kebab was not up to the mark. limited sea food. You will also find a chaat corner which serves pav bhaji and few varieties of chaat  Main course- This one was a disappointment. Not much to offer and taste was just average    Desserts- This was most impressive. I don't exactly remember the name but most of the puddings and cakes were really good
3.5,"I came here with a bunch of friends for an early lunch a couple of days back. The vibrant ambience and the lovely staff were very welcoming. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of both vegetarian and no vegetarian starters in comparison to most buffet places. Most places are usually a let down when it comes to main course options but sultans serve an array of desi delicacies for to choose from for main course. They have a live chat counter for all the street food lovers out there. The buffet also showcases a decent amount of desserts both Indian and Western like pastries, mousses, tarts, cakes, kaju katli, gajar ka halwa.... So do try this place out if you happen to be in the neighborhood."

4.5,"Good food, North Indian cuisine, classy ambience, decor and seating. This place is good for a weekend dinner with friends and family.........."
5.0,A wonderful place to visit with our family. Great ambience... great food... great hospitality . There are a wide range of dishes in both veg and non veg food. I feel it is worth the money you spend. The steward Aloke was very polite and catered to our needs patiently with a smiling face.
4.0,This place is nice to go for buffets which we opted for when been there for lunch along with our team.some of the live counters were serving amazing food.The spread was quite decent and staffs were also well behaved. There is no parking for two wheelers apart that Would like to visit this place again.
3.5,"Why Sultans of Spice  Sultans of Spice (SoS) was not our first choice for a Saturday late lunch. Wife wanted to visit Kopper Kadai, but by the time we reached at 430 pm, it was closed.  We walked around to find suitable places (MIL was also with us), we landed at SoS.  Where it is  SoS is a part of the BluPetal hotel in Koramangala, on Jyothi Nivas College Road and is known for its buffet. The folks at the reception told us they would check if the buffet was still open. It was not, but they said could work something out for us in the a la carte section. We gleefully accepted (hunger) and took the elevator to the 4th floor.  How the place looks  SoS has the ambience of  what someone would describe as a proper North Indian restaurant  the cushy chairs, the lightings, and the Rajasthan style paintings. I liked it, because it has been a long while since Ive visited a North Indian restaurant in Bangalore, I think Punjab Grill was the last one, and that was a long time back. Even at the late hour, there was quite a number of patrons who were still finishing their lunch buffet, so I would advice you to make an advance reservation. It is a popular place.  What we had  Veg platter  which consisted of veg seekh kebab, tandoori gobi, malai paneer tikka, roast baby potato, cheese stuffed mushroom.  Veg Main course  Dilli Punjabi Afghani Malai Kofta  Breads  Butter Tandoori Roti  Rice  Navratan Pulao  Dessert (of sorts)  Pan milk  How it was  The veg platter was the winner and most memorable order of the afternoon. Every single dish was brilliant and rich. For instance, take the mushroom  it was stuffed with cheese and cooked in a tandoor. The mushroomy taste combined with the milky cheese makes for a very different and enjoyable taste (go back to mixing tastes in Ratatouille). The potato had some sort of a sweet aftertaste to it  I mean other than the actual potato taste itself. The seekh kebab was the best, well minced and you could taste the crunchy almonds as you bite into it. The tandoori gobi and paneer tikka were pretty well made.  The malai kofta was slightly off, a little extra cream. Otherwise it was pretty much the standard recipe of a malai kofta which a good chef can stir up. It did not help that the rice had a little less salt as well.  We asked for the pan milk as dessert  it was good, but somewhat ruined by a cinnamon topping. I am not sure why the kitchen would do that.  Service  The overall service was good, waiters were quite attentive and served us well. They constantly kept checking if we needed serving and were polite. One of them goofed up when the spoon he was supposed to serve with fell down and he was about to serve with the same without replacing, but his superior stopped him and apologized. He came back to ask for feedback and accepted some suggestions we gave.  Billling  SoS did not add the service charge, so I gladly added a INR 50 tip. I wish every establishment follows the same practice."
4.0,"We went there for the weekend buffet and were not dissapointed. We experienced great starters, fast service, decent ambience and some good desserts. The place was a little crowded but that is what you will expect from a popular food destination. We had the vegetarian buffet. The only downside here was the main course with very limited variety and average taste. Otherwise they have good starters, live counter for chaat and nice desserts."
3.5,"It was a good experience as I went there when 'Delhi street food festival 'was going on. What I personally felt, the food is very spicy. As I don't like spicy food so that is the only thing I can ask them to change. Otherwise the dessert counter was really great. The main course was also good."
3.0,"Visiting this place with friend few days back. Place wasn't crowded as we expected, ambiance was decent, I order tawa king fish, chicken gravy and buttermilk and my friend order paner kebab, corn onion sabzi. Food quality not that great as per our teast. Fish was smelling like old and chicken was okey okey. But we like corn onion sabzi and rasmalai. Service was good but not extraordinary. Over all it was good experience but not full satisfied."
1.0,Pathetic service for alacarte and worst quality of food. Veg pulav with coloured green peas and raw uncooked green beans. Expensive too for nothing. Would never visit again. Had upset my stomach for the high price paid
4.0,"I rated this a 4 because of their courteous and sincere staff including the chef. The ambience is a quintessential mughal type set up however the food lacks the zest of authentic mughlai food. And i contemplate this to be because its a business hotel and has all kind of customers including foreigners. The food doesn't really remark the sultanate of spices as per indian palate but definitely defines rich cuisines. In my opinion the restaurant must prepare their dishes considering the ethnicity of the clients who are ordering it. A little more salt, spice and everything nice should be added for their indian customers. But overall this place is worth a visit. :-)"
5.0,Food was awesome...it's very tasty and authentic ...I feel the stuff is very polite and helpful... chefs efforts is comamandable... overall it's a good experience and decor is also fine...

4.5,"Service is amazing!!  The hospitality is great and so is the food. Non veg starters were just delicious be it prawns, fish, crispy chicken or mushroom, they were just too good. Main course was limited so was the desserts but surely you would not want to miss it out for the service they deliver , food they offer and the price they charge its worth it.  kudos to the staff!! even the deadliest man would smile for the courteous staff they got :D :D"

5.0,Awesome food and great service - a come back place for sure. The paneer makhani and ulta parantha are ultimate - please open in other parts of the city as well
4.0,"So, we decided to go to this place for a perfect family dinner.The ambience was really good and so were the staffs.The staffs were really courteous and the food was good as well.We had ordered tomato shorba,tikka rasmonak and cheese aur makai k kabab for starters. The soup was delicious.The kebabs were kind of sweet in taste and the tikkas were soft and spicy.It was a good choice.Later we ordered achari paneer tikka, mushroom masala,pulao,kulchas and naan.The masala kulchas however seemed more like alu paranthas, save that rest was good.We had also ordered pudina and kala khatta shikanji.Pudina was good . However the kalakhatta, tasted more like a syrup.Save few things, this is a good place with good people and good ambience."
3.5,"We went here for a team lunch here. We had prior booking, and the ambience felt nice. They have chaat counters just after the entrance, I didn't try the chaats though. We had both veg and non veg starters. Most of them are just ok. The spicy pron was better. Chicken legs were not well cooked though.  The starter service was pathetic. It happened that we asked for something, and it came when we gave up hope and moved to main course. Biryani was nice in the main course. We liked the raabri and jalebi in desert.  Ambience 3.5/5 Food 3.5/5 Service and presentation 3/5 Value for money 3.5/5"

3.0,"Good food not so great service.  Service is a big let down. The food is tasty and good but the frequency of starts being served on the table is very slow.  We had to remind multiple times before something would get served. Also the quantity brought wasn't even enough for the whole table.  Also food is not replenished quickly even during peak  buffet time.   Both veg and non veg are priced the same. Starts are good, mains avg , live counters is too slow with only 1 person serving.  Small place can get crowded. The experience would be a lot better if only the service can be improved."

4.0,"Planned for Sunday brunch. Had an good varieties of starters with really nice ambience. The aroma of the food can make anyone go crazy about it. Liked the presentation of them. The staff was good, the Head chef himself was taking care of everyone wherever required but the prompt service was a bit where I was disappointed. Overall had a great experience."
3.0,Had been here for a team outing based on the Zomato ratings.  Couple of Veg starters were rally good but viz corn cheese kebab  and veg sheek kabab rest were not very great.  Main course and deserts were also limited and nothing really stood out for me except the jalebi which was excellent.  Service has to improve and non-vegetarian was a big let down as per me colleague's feedback.
