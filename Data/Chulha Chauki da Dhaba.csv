1.0,"This is the place where I had worst Punjabi Food of my life. I dont think they even eat food cooked by themselves. I went along with my Punjabi friend, we have ordered a Dal Makhani & Shahi Paneer, trust me, the food didnt even have traces of punjabi essence, let alone the taste.  They should rather replace punjabi interior with cocunut trees and start serving food on banana leaf, because their taste is more of South.  Food Taste: 0/10 Interior: 10/10 Service: 9/10 Waiters: 10/10 Quality(Hygiene, freshness): 10/10 Price: No Justification against quality, way too high. Zomato Rating: Much much over-rated"

2.0,"The only reason that I gave the second star was for the decent food. People have been giving great reviews about the food and staff, but I dont know what happened the day we went there. It was my friend's birthday and we were a group of twelve, the place was full already even on a Tuesday. So when we got the menu we immediately ordered as it said the order might take 25-35 minutes. We ordered starters and main course both around 9:20. All had come from office so we were quite hungry. The starter came at 10 and the main course at 11. We were really hungry and infuriated, and when we asked the staff that why it was being so late, we got rude and sarcastic replies from the manager. The food was nice but didn't justify the high rates. It was overall bad experience and no one in my circle might be visiting the place again."

3.0,"Decent ambience + homely food + friendly staff sums up my experience here. We ordered gobi 65, paneer tikka, baby corn masala with roti/naan, lassi and paaan. Note that you will be tempted to eat the paan by its look but mind you it's chargeable ;) It might be spicy for non Andhraites. The taste was not too great but decent enough for a try sometime with friends when you miss your family and homely stuff."

4.0,"This place is one of my favourite. Had been here couple of times. Very good dhaba to have Punjabi food. But there is no pre table booking system. You have to go early to get a place. Else you have to wait to get into. Cz this place will be very crowded all the time.  They have open space and indoor sitting arrangements. Well maintained place with simple lighting and decors and all those rope chairs and cots will give you feeling of being in a proper punjabi dhaba.  Coming to food we ordered many things. And everything was delicious. Hara Bhara kabab and masala papad is very good option for vegetarians. Even chatpata Paneer is also good. Tangdi kabab, Lahori Chicken, Egg curry is must try items in their menu. And yeah kulhad lassi is really yummy. Worth having. Must try their lassi.  Service was on time and staffs were good.  A must try place for punjabi food lovers!"
3.0,"Food  1)Hara Bhara Kabab was very soft and nicely cooked.One of the favorite starters for veggie people.  2)Special Handi paneer tasted nice but was too much spicy and spoiled the complete meal.I was promised that it would be medium spicy but it was not as expected.  3)Masala papad tasted little spicy but was delicious.  4)Kulah lassi was yummy as always and this is my primary reason to visit Chulha Chowki Everytime.  Cost Cost is not reasonable nor expensive. The price of parathas are quite high. Hotel staff was quite responsive and kind.  Experience Everytime I visit chulha chowki , I am always satisfied but due to the main course disaster, I wasn't happy this time.  Rating Food- 3/5 Cost- 3.5/5 Ambience-4/5 Staff-5/5 Location-3/5"

Can be thoroughly enjoyed with a big group.  Their service is pretty neat and their food is delicious.   I love their tandoori chicken and I have had their tandoori mushroom in the past. Both are amazing. Their tandoori rotis are fresh and warm.  We tried one of their spicy chicken mains, which was great too.  I think they have reduced their portions from the last time I visited but it was still more than enough for two. Their boondi raita I thought was too little. It was more like a serving for one and a half adults.  Their buttermilk was average.   In general a good place for Indian food.  Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Ambience: 5/5"
1.0,"The chulha chauki Da dhaba is corrupted dhaba there was no income but they don't give the salary of employes .

So I say to the all people don't work on this dhaba. When I was on problem the manager says "" nahi Dunga tera salary , Jaa jo karna hai karle"" I want to say them why they don't give my salary I don't beg them their money I beg my working salary"

This time we ordered chicken Sawariya for starters and the famous Lahori chicken for main course coupled with tandoori roti & stuffed kulcha and sweet Lassi.  To be honest food was simply fab. It would be a great thing if the serving staff can ask for any modification in the level of spices as per requirement. I usually cant handle much spicy food which was pretty evident after taking the first bite of Chicken Sawariya & pickled onion but luckily got saved by sweet lassi   Overall, the serving staffs were polite, quick service, fabulous ambience and waiting time was only 10 mins. Great experience !!!"

4.0,Decent food. Masala and food colour is a little high in every dish. Taste is decent good though. Ambiance is nice. Lassi and jal jeera is good.
5.0,Ambience is very good.food is very tasty...do try egg curry & kulhad lassi...courageous staff...service is timely you need to wait for long post ordering food
4.0,Good food.. Lots of variety for veg and nonveg.. Lassi is awesome.. Well cooked chicken. All items taste yummm...Must go for every one in whitefield
2.0,Rice was cooked I guess one day back. It was dry like hell. Below average food . Totally not worth the money spent.packaging was good and so is the hygiene.
4.0,"Typical Punjabi style dhaba in luru! Right from the seatings, ambience and the staffs dressed like punjabis.  If you like North Indian Dhaba style food then this is the one. It has indoor seatings as well as rooftop seatings with chauki and local cutleries.  Menu has equal veg and non veg options. We started with crunchy Masala papad. We wanted to try something in Mushroom so ordered Mushroom tikki. Its a win win if you're also a fan of Mushroom and its bit spicy.  Sawariya Chicken in Tandoori was amazing. This has two leg pieces and two breast pieces. Meat was very succulent and perfectly made with pudina marination.  Parathas is a must when in Punjabi Dhaba! We had Paneer Paratha and Gobi Paratha. Paneer Paratha is mouth melting and a must try here! These are one of the best Parathas I have ever had. They are made with ghee which adds a distinct flavour to it.  How can we miss kulhad lassi?! That's the best way to end a Punjabi meal. Its chilled and perfectly sweetened. I absolutely loved it! P.S : Its a large serve for one if you're already full. Fresh sweet pan is also available!  Attentive staffs and nice hospitality. Overall a good Dhaba experience in IT city!"
4.0,"Visited Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba on my brother's recommendation for good north indian food. After recently visiting Kapoor's cafe, I was quite curious to see how Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba would fare in comparison.  Ambience is good, seating area is decently sized, but looking at the popularity of the place, I assume there will definitely be some amount of waiting during the weekends. The whole place has a Dhaba vibe , with the seats, lighting etc.  Coming to the food, we ordered paneer tikka, butter garlic naan, paneer Amritsari,Dum aloo ,gulab jamun and jaljeera. The food is delicious, quite authentic and very flavorful. The Dum aloo was slightly spicy, but still tasted quite good. The paneer tikka was well marinated and extremely tasty. The jaljeera was good, missed out on the lassi though, will definitely try it the next time.  All in all a great place for North Indian food, value for money is good and food on the whole is quite delicious. Parking for four wheelers could be an issue and the place gets crowded on weekends. Will definitely be back for more."
3.0,A 100 out of 100 for the ambience perfect Dhaba feeling. Food was average. Good music & friendly staff. Portion was way less & it can make a big hole in your pocket. Good to visit it once but not more than that.
4.0,"Date of visit: 31-Jan-2019 Time of visit: 13:30  Location:    Brookfield , AECS layout (@prime location)   Parking:   situated at complex roof top, 3 restaurants sharing parking. Very little parking space and its a drawback.  Service:   it was very good and organised. While we were waiting only we have placed the order and saved time.   Cleanliness:   Tables and surrounding places were clean.  Restrooms and wash rooms are located outside dining area. This is really good. In some restaurants it will be near and we get bad smell. Cheers for this.  Menu:   * Since its punjabi style most of all the starters are tandoori items both in veg and non-veg.  * 5-7 Chinese items also available  * no mutton starters - mutton lovers will definitely miss something.  * recommending to include mutton items in menu.  Pricing:  - * compare to near by restaurants price is little high for tandoori items  * but quality of food is good, so we wont feel about pricing  Food Review:   Starters: * both veg and non-veg starters are good and tasty * veg lovers in my team also loved all the starters   Main course: * both chicken and mutton gravy are very tasty. * veg dhal and paneer gravy also very good. * for BIRIYANI I will give 0 (zero) rating, as you all know Im a biriyani lover.  Not sure how they made biriyani its like mixed boiled chicken and mutton in veg pulav.  * JEERA rice also not good, they ve used biriyani rice but taste not good.No flavour in rice, not able to feel jeera flavour    Juice and drinks: *jal jeera and lassi are superb as usual.   Final conclusion: - * this restaurant is only for people who like 1. chicken and veg tandoori items. 2. Roti lovers   * Definitely not for rice lovers.   Recommendation: - * need to include mutton items also * need lots of improvements in rice items like biriyani, jeera rice etc.  Rating: 3.75 to 4 star"
4.0,"This place is good for North indian n Punjabi style food. Seating arrangement too gives you dhaba look. I can suggest you mushroom tikka spicy starter, non-veg chicken kadhai n handi, lassi is at top of my choices"
4.0,"In mood for North Indian food, this is the place. They serve delicious non vegetarian starters. I would recommend sawariya kabab and Kalmi kabab. Some of the veg starters were also good. Main course is excellent. Chicken tikka masala and butter chicken is recommended. Please be aware that this restaurant is small and advance booking is adviced. Crowded at peak times but a visit is absolutely must if you are in mood for some spicy North Indian food."
4.0,Food was nice and tasty. The servicing time was very less. Standard prices for the food. Stuffed kulcha was one the best I had in Bangalore. Given one star less as there is no Ac here.
4.0,"If you want to go to a Punjabi place then this dhaba is one of the choices. Lassi we tasted, it was awesome. Service was very good. It was Saturday night,so the place was too crowded."
5.0,"A very good place with a very reasonable rate. Amenities are very good in terms of proper ""Desi Style"". Foods are tasty as well. So altogether it's a great place for dining out."
4.0,Awesome. .. lightening fast delivered. Delivered under 10mins dot...:)
5.0,Best kalmi kabab! Everything here tastes amazing let it be rice or rotis! Perfect North Indian food. Lil oily so not good for people on diet but best for cheat days
5.0,"I came here on recommendation and boy, was it good! The place is beautiful, and being a North Indian, I was reminded of dhabas. The food is exceptionally good. We had chicken kalmi kebabs which were heart-warming! We ordered some chicken dish and naan, but it's was the dal tadka that left me speechless. It's hands-down the best dal tadka I've had in Bangalore so far.   P.S. Go to this restaurant for dinner, sit in the open terrace on khatiyas, and experience the food rather than just eat it!"
5.0,"I ordered Sahi paneer, lollypop manchurian and sweet lassi everything is awesom and service is fast.  Food 5* Service 5* Ambience 5* ( Like khaat) Price pocket friendly"
5.0,"Excellent food and Good Service Taste we ordered Chicken butter masala, chicken lahori and Sawariya kabab with Butter Kulcha the test was completely amazing 5* Service is excellent they are very promptly. 5* and Ambience is also good"
4.0,"Good food , nice ambience, good hospitality  . Liked their starters specially aloo chilly . Best place for spicy food. We come here regularly with friends."
2.0,Service was a big mixup. They have alot of unwanted boys walking around and i infact noticed one of them and his partner making fun of the manner in which a customer from another table had his meal. I was offended by that.  Food tasted really good. Portionsize was poor for the cost of food. Atleast increases portion size or reduce the cost to a level that ordering more food would not be a huge hole in our wallets.
4.0,Place was crowded as it was raining outside so ordered few items yet it took a real long time for it to be served. It made me hangry due to delay but food was amazing.  Value for money and only hope they improve their service
3.0,"I thought I have already reviewed this place but I guess I forgot to save it. I have been here on multiple occasions. Anyways, this is a descent place to have food. The only issue I have is- Their behaviour changes as per crowd. If there is waiting , they will force you to pay and go even if you are not completely done. Otherwise, food taste is good enough in comparison to similar restaurants."
4.0,A must visit place if you are looking for some good north indian food. Food served is brilliant in taste. Due to heavy crowd sometimes you got to wait little bit.  Taste : 4/5 Ambience : 3.5/5 Quantity : 4/5 Service : 3.5/5 Cost :
4.0,"It was nice being there with my friends, nice north Indian food. I really enjoyed it. But guys, I really appreciate if I can get my spectacles back, coz I forgot them there, this last Friday on 11th jan. Please get bck to me as reply, if I have it with you safe. I will come and collect."
4.0,"Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba is known for its delicious dishes spread over different cuisines and also it's amazing ambience.It has great options for Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian food.The Paneer Tikka,Paneer Butter Masala, Mushroom Kadai ,Butter Naan are a must try here. Also this place serves one of the best Butter chicken and tandoori Chicken Don't forget to sip onto a glass full of some refreshing Lassi and chew some Paan post eating."
4.0,"Went there for a team lunch ,  Tried Butter Nun, Chicken angari, Chicken punjabi and Chicken Butter Masala along with sweet lassi and Sweet Paan  Ambience is good , as well as the taste of the food .  But the place is expensive as per the quantity and quality of the food !  Overall nice place to have a team lunch ."
3.0,"Had been here multiple times.  Ambience - 4 (dim light up place with dhaba style seating arrangement - khatiyas & bamboo chairs) Food- 3.5  Service - 4 Wait time - 2(Its crazy over the weekends!!)  The food is actually okayish. Today had been there. Ordered fulkas n kadai paneer. Everything was good until I took a nice bite of my 3rd fulka with the paneer. A hard bite and immediately spit it out. It was a small stone.  Though this was my 1st such experience here, yet i would hesitate coming back."
3.0,Its ok Restaurant... For veg dishes its really good But i think for non veg its too oily... Taste also average of chicken... Here you must try missi roti...
1.0,"If you keep my mouth on fire, you need respect from me, horrible spicy , because of all of you we can not eat today, need to check your test(spicy level)"
1.0,"WORST FOOD EVER!!!! In the name of spicy North Indian food, these idiots are using unnecessary extra green chilli which will blow not your mind but each part of your body!!!!  The worst was when you speak with the manager to complain, he is more adamant and pose as if you are a firang and you do not know the Spice of Indian food. Will never ever order the food from these idiots!!!  The food was not worth the price we paid for, and managers response and attitude was equally pathetic to what I complained for!!!  Found from other reviews that I am not alone who suffered such spicy food. I regret not to take those reviews seriously. Had I taken those reviews seriously then would have not got my tounge burnt so bad!!"
5.0,Good place for casual dining. Mutton Rogan Josh and kullad lassi is a must try!  You could enjoy the rooftop dining here. They play very dhaba-ish music too :-) . They light lamps every day here and they care a lot about cleanliness and hygiene of the place.  Overall it was a good experience. Will visit again.
4.0,"This place serve North Indian food to be precise punjabi cuisine, they have a wide range of veg n non veg dishes. We had ordered Chicken lollipop , mushroom pepper masala, kadai paneer n lassi all tasted good. Spices are on a higher level so if you dont prefer spicy food you need to inform them before."
5.0,"Loved their food to the core. I visited here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with family.  On our plate was roti, ghee roti, papad, Masala papad, gulab jamun, dal makhani,panner 2 pyaza, fried rice.  I loved dal makhani too much."
2.0,"Taste is on okay or good side depending on item, Like kebabs and nans are good but gravies are generally tasteless here. And on the quality side, In my opinion ,quality of foods might not be good."
4.0,The place quite small. It's like a dhaba. But the taste of non veg is yumm. Food is really great. Nice place. Ambience is quite okay. U will enjoy the food
4.0,Ambience is good. The food we ordered was paneer kofta which was bit sweet. But properly cooked. Staff is cooperative. It is not very expensive.
4.0,This place needs no introduction... It is quite famous for its delicious North Indian food... We finally managed to experience the place... We had ordered : Butter naan Tandoori roti Paneer malai kofta Butter chicken Tandoori chicken  I was surprised with the food... It was DELICIOUS... specially the paneer kofta . They undoubtedly serve the best paneer malai kofta.... The tandoori chicken was also really nice... The quality of chicken that is served here is really mention worthy....  A really nice place to eat... Highly recommended... Would definitely be back soon...
2.0,I ordered through Zoomato and the food was all over the carry bag. I wonder after so much going on with zoomato delivery how can they not seal the container with the tape. Will think twice before ordering again. Gave was star as the remaining item was tasty.
4.0,As usual good taste
4.0,"An awesome restaurant to hang out with friends and family. Food is great ...delicious , specially the Kulada Lassi. Love it. Only issue I had is too much of waiting time to have a table. Maybe that also says Food here is in great Demand"
5.0,The best Palace of north Indian foodie. Very nice place to visit once in a while lassi is amazing try chicken butter masala and desi ghee fulka.
1.0,"Dead cockroach found at the back of nan. It was black and looked as a part of burnt nan, but on seeing it very closely we got to know that it's dead cockroach. Not sure about the hygiene of the kitchen. They didn't show us the kitchen when asked for. Be careful while having any tandoor item here. Always check the tandoor items on the back before eating. Very bad experience."
1.0,"Horrible food , despite of telling the restaurant to make the dishes less spicy they put additional chilly"
4.0,Food was excellent with good ambience where you can feel homely experience. But Price was little bit high and need to provide more discounts for corporates for better attraction for team lunch/dinners.Need to visit again.
4.0,"Always a pleasure. Only drawback would be the wait. Everytime I go, there's a queue waiting. But the food sure makes up for it. Must have would be any of the tandoori starters in non veg, masala papad, lassi, ghee rice and their special Dal tadka. The Dal tadka and ghee rice is to die for, definitely not for the calorie conscious."
4.0,"Three adjectives to this place - simple, great and (you got to tell me the third one). The ambience is superb with their simple setup. The food is great that is finely serviced by their crew. Each member has a happy face and an honest opinion if you had to ask them ""what is not worth it on the menu"". A true experience of excellency and lead."
5.0,This is place osum. Foods are tasty and yummy. People are very courteous. I tried paneer Tikka masala and kadhai chicken. Only problem is we have to wait as queue will be long but that wait will be worth off.
5.0,"Fantastic place for North Indian food. Great ambience - a more hygienic version of a highway dhaba with bamboo furniture. The rotis were excellent; the missi roti in particular was the best I've had. The dal makhani was outstanding too. The paneer tikka and veg gravy were adequate. Oh and don't miss the salt lassi; again amongst the best I've had. Overall, a good value for money place. Highly recommended!"
3.0,"This is a Punjabi dhaba themed restaurant. I was surprised to see a huge waiting que outside and was really expecting great food experience but it was very average.  We ordered hara bhara kebab, stuffed mushrooms, lassis and jal jeera to start with. The kebabs and mushrooms were good, nothing exceeding the expectation that was set by the length of the waiting que. We had also ordered for paneer Tikka masala and mixed veggies kofta curry again both were good, nothing worth highlighting about it. We ended the dinner with a meetha paan  It's a good place if you want to have a pocket friendly family dinner however not a must visit place."
4.0,If love your north Indian food then this is a place to go. This place is a dhaba in an urban setting. Food served is delicious. We went for lunch and as usual there was a large queue. So make sure you reach early.
5.0,"Went there today.  Ordered: ginger chicken kebab, aloo kulcha, masahala kulcha, butter garlic kulcha, oanjabi chicken mashala.  All the items were too tasty + pure north indian.  Excellent service."
5.0,One of best places in Bangalore for beautiful dining experience. Yummy dishes too. Out door dining is superb. All the dishes are of good quality too.
4.0,"so visited this place on a sunday,,,,i accept my mistake,,,i was over crowded,,,well....i am talking about CROWD WAITING OUTSIDE the restaurant,,,, that speaks about the place..  food- 5/5 (both veg- non veg) ambience- 4/5 seating is not very comfortable service- 3/5 (esp. on weekends) parking - 5/5 (two wheeler), 2/5 (four wheels) VFM - 4/5  make sure you have enough patience and time before you reach,,,long QUEUES."
3.0,Food is very good however now a days service time is increased. As well as we found some of our favourite items are not available I E Paratha s. Good we get it
3.0,"Been here for dinner! The taste and quality is okay but not worth the money they charge. The quantity of food is too less compared to the money they charge.The kebabs were pretty good but again the quantity was too less. The service is pathetic and they took almost 40mins to serve the main course. Overall, I feel that there are other places in Bangalore that serve better food, with better quantity and service. The ambience is the only thing I liked about them. I feel if they increase the quantity, it will be a better place to hang out."
5.0,"The food here is awesome in taste.  The real North Indian taste you can feel it here. If you are planning to have dinner on Sunday and get there after 8.30, you will have to stand in the long waiting queue.  The space is very less and only a few people can be seated in all at once."
3.0,"I have visited this place many atimes over my tenure in Bangalore , used to be an excellent place earlier is now deteriorating slowly . Over crowded, slow service . Food quality and quantity is fine considering the North Indian taste bud ."
3.0,"We had ordered methi malai mutter , malai kofta and Kulchas.Malai kofta gravy  was very spicy to my disappointment, perhaps we could have been queried by the staff about our spice level preference.The kofta balls tasted good.Methi malai had a creamy texture with a soothing flavor of the fenugreek and tasted good.Kulchas were soft and perfect.Ambience was great, typical dhaba style where we chose a cozy corner.Parking is a problem for 4-wheelers.Service was ok-ish. Rates were higher than what reflected in Zomato, we were informed by the staff that were in the process of being updated.Overall good experience."
1.0,I had a very worst experience here for the first time. I did visit here so many times but this time waiters and  manager(ANIL) didnt even respond properly. And the quality of the food is down.
1.0,"Im very sad to write this review. I have been to many restaurants but never felt giving 1 star rating. The service is very pathetic. They are taking at least 30-45 mins to serve one dish (Im saying 1 dish, if you have ordered multiple items , you know the math ). When we asked about the delay , the waiters were not responding , but at least they are polite. But the manager there (his name is Anil), was very rude with us. Not felt like eating food there anymore . To talk about the taste , its not the same as Before ... quality has gone down drastically.... prices are gone high though... @Restaurant owners , please understand that , you are not helping us by serving food. Its other way . If you want the customer , please be polite with them. Even you do the mistake , they will forget , if you are kind enough to accept your mistake ."
5.0,"This has been our go to place whenever we crave for north indian food, which is at least once a month (for the last few years :)). The food and service has been consistently good, without hurting your pocket!"
1.0,pathetic experience I ordered food online and was delivered wrong order I had ordered Paneer kadai but received kadai mushroom And to add to that the restaurant is also not responding to my calls
4.0,"The place is cozy and food is good, the chapathis specially we loved it -thin and perfect. Paneer Khurchan we order it was good too. Ambience is great.  Two things which I didnt liked- Waiting time for food after you have ordered it. The seating arrangement is very compact and the waiters are always on your head leaving you with no space of your own to njoi"
4.0,"Nice Place to have North Indian Food. Excellent food, quick service, Location is good., Portion size should b bit more. Only con the place felt over crowded and quite cramped, tables are closely put, one can easily hear whats the conversation happening at other table.Parking is a problem in this area.  Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 3/5 VFM - 4/5"
4.0,Best place in the locality. Thought a bit costly but the food and the place ambience is just perfect. The outdoor sitting has Punjabi style charpai. Lassi served here is not a thing to miss. Kalmi kabab along with chilli chicken is the thing u will like to order
3.0,"I have heard a lot about Chulha Chauki da Dhabha for people, who love the food being served here. I was planning to visit the place for sometime but couldn't, so decided to order food at home.  We ended up ordering dal tadka, paneer subji and kulcha. The taste and quantity was decent. Though the food turned out to be too spicy and we couldn't finish off the whole thing.  Well, considering my experience but taking into account the good reviews I have heard, I am rating it at medeocre. Cheers!"
4.0,Nice village theme ambience. Tried Veg starters and Paneer Amritsari sabji with Butter Kultcha. Veg food is exotic and rich of flavours. Garlic and Ginger flavor is more in sabji and starter. Suggestion to reach early for dinner especially on weekends to avoid waiting.
4.0,"As usual, this place is nice. Less crowded as we went for lunch. By the time we left, people were waiting. Food tastes awesome here. Definitely worth a visit with family. PS - Masala Papad here means ""roasted papad with tomato and onion toppings ONLY. Bit disappointed how same gets served here otherwise rest of the food tested awesome."
3.0,"Good ambience, comfortable sitting, gives complete feel of typical dhaba experience.  Food is average, servicing is slow and staff is not so friendly..  For sure one time place, though be sure to tell them your preference of spices... We were served too spicy food and had not so great experience"
5.0,I liked that this restaurant have quality foods in Non-veg and veg. Very cost effective and good ambience. This is ideal place for hang out. Loved this place for their Non-Veg items most and Lassi.
4.0,"Awesome food.Visited for 2nd time.Pure dhaba style food served like in dhaba.We took stuffed butter kulcha, mushroom chilly , masala papad n two curry.All are having their flavor.please have a visit."
1.0,"Very bad service. We waited for more than 45 mins and then the waiter came and told us that dish is not available. Also, the food taste is okok."
1.0,"Pathetic food, i guess they had ample amount of chilli and they chose to treat their customers with chilli. We ordered manchurian, hariyali kebab , veg kofta , missi roti and butter garlic naan... manchurian was average, they served hariyali kebab after 25 min of ordering and it was cold and we had to ask them to heat it . Next came the main course the worst i have ever had till date. Butter missi roti was nothing like missi roti it was like rosted pappad... garlic butter naan was like rubber it was so difficult to even pull apart the naan and butter nor garlic was seen.... veg kofta was extremely spicy , while ordering we were told it would be medium spicy n not sweet but it was lile hell spicy it left blisters in mouth.... kullad lassi was okay nothing like earlier. .. #worstfood #qualitydetoriorated #DontEverWasteUrTasteBuds"
3.0,The food at this place is definitely tasty. There is no doubt about that. But the service is painfully slow. I had to wait for more than an hour for the food to arrive.
3.0,"Very nice place. Ordered masala papad , chicken tikka in starter . It was good in taste ordered afgaani chicken , chicken butter masala and chicken angaara and naan . All were delicious and quantity was good. Ended the dinner with lassi ... Sweet and authentic. Although I feel chicken angaara could have been better. Food : 3 stars Ambience: 4 stars Service : 4 stars"
4.0,"Amazing North Indian food! Must try - Any Dhaal, Chicken with Pulka combination ! An affordable and tasty - Dhaba! Food hygiene is pretty good."
3.0,Food was not that great....Taste was average..Had to wait for nearly 1 hour before we could make it for dine in..Overall okay experience....
4.0,Been to many punjabi places recently and this is one among. Quiet place with nice seating arrangement similar to classic dhaba . Coming to the food it was little spicy like expected . Can do better on the starters front. Main course was wonderful and delicious. Overall a budget place and can be on the list in top 5.
2.0,"Not that great ambience. Not that great sitting arrangement. Not at all dhaba like food, but quantity was good. Food can be better. Waiting time is too much. Not recommended."
5.0,"I visited this place multiple times and food here is out of the world. You should try the kababs and all of them are delicious. The chicken dishes are awesome and so is their biriyani. And if u don't drink the lassi, it will be a real miss. Overall terrific experience everytime."
3.0,Ambiance is good. Food is average . Ghee phulka (very soft) and lassi are must try items. Sabji and curries are good but with lot of oil/ghee and sometimes spicy too.
4.0,We visited this place for dinner and few days back with family.A fantastic experience-good decoration excellent food--we would like to visit again at our next visit to Bangalore
5.0,Its an awesome place with an authentic taste of food. Ambience is also too good.. specially the malai kabab is finger licking good...and the kulhad laasi too.
5.0,"This is one of the best ambiance plus food restaurants I have been to. Having a place like dhaba in between a city is really an amazing feeling and to those who have grown up being fond of dhabas, this is the place. If anyone is looking for food, ambiance and service, this is the place.  Before reaching there, I made a call reservation as it was team lunch, so didn't want any last minute hustle. When we reached there, we were taken to the outside sitting as requested. As soon as we sat there waiters were there with the menu and provided us ample time to decide on it. We ordered our food, and it took them 10-15 mins to serve us the food. Food was really tasty and the quantity was sufficient for 3 people to have in 1 bowl of any Sabji or Dal bowl.  Must try veg items- Garlic butter naan, Diwani Handi, Dal makhni, Hara bhara kabab, Malai paneer tikka, kadhai paneer, methi mutter malai."
4.0,"Amazing food, very reasonable price, quick service, been here couple of times I love the food. Typical north Indian style food. Tried paneer tikka, chicken do pyazza loved it, it is a must try.  We also tired chicken biryani which was also good, but not best hence 4* .. Will definitely recommend this place because of the yummy food and authentic north Indian style.  Weekends are always rush. May have to wait for a little long time. So if planning to go to this place during weekends in evening,pre-booking table is recommended."
1.0,The service is pathetic. Their is mismanagement in handling orders and delivering them. If they expect such a big crowd to come to their restaurant they should be ready with proper time management. Really a bad experience.
4.0,"Went here multiple times as it is close to my home. Food is just awesome. Starters are little spicy but are good in taste. Veggies like Panner kofta curry, veg saagwala and paneer kurchan are great in taste. Lassi is okayish. Ambience is quite good with punjabi music. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor they have khaat and muddi style of seating, which is difficult to get as that area is always full. Weekends you have to wait 30-40 mins to get a place. Service not that great and needs to be worked upon. Rates are little on the higher side according to the quantity they serve. Overall a nice experience.  Food - 4.5/5 Service - 3/5 Ambience - 4/5 Value for Money - 3/5"
4.0,"The ambience is nice, there is outdoor sitting, which feels like you are in an actual dhaba. The service is super fast. About the food, I had paneer bhurji was Excellent, dal makhni was thick and I could taste butter, jeera rice was perfectly cooked and tasted good with dal makhni. Nice place, definitely worth visiting."
4.5,My go to place for comfort Indian food. Although it has mostly a minimum wait time of 10-15 mins it is totally worth it. Palak paneer is a must try. Try the CCDD special kebab for starters. Don't leave without drinking a glass of their lassi.
4.0,This was my second visit to the place. The food is good and likeable. Though I would not tell it is full authentic punjabi dhaba feel ( For that do try pyare punjabi dhaba on tumkur road ) but yeah good for punjabi cuisine. Food : 3.5/5 Chicken tikka masala is very good and would recommend it. Lassi and chach are also very good. Missi roti is also a must try. Ambience : 5/5 Really like what they have done with the place. Sitting on khat and eating gives a relaxing feeling :) . Service : 3.5/5 Actually have a mixed reaction about service. Did not like some people from the staff. Last time when we reached and just after sitting the waiter started asking for order. We told just wait and at least let us check the menu and items but he was very adamant to take order fast. ( This is the most irritating thing for me in a restaurant) But the person who brought food was really polite and was serving and talking with a smile and really liked him.  Overall a good experience food wise both the time and would recommend the place for both lunch and dinner time.
1.0,I tried ordering food from this restaurant. They only delivered partially. What am I going to eat the curry with if the rotis are not delivered. Very dissatisfied with Zomato customer care and the restaurant
5.0,"I went to this place on recommendation of friends and am truly glad that I did , My parents had come to Bangalore and this is found to be the best place in Bangalore for North Indian food.We ordered Paneer Sitara which was one of their specials and dal Tadka, which was truly awesome and phulkas & Laccha Parathas reminded me of of my hometown ,nevertheless to say my parents enjoyed a lot final Word is : Great Taste & Pocket Friendly with Village type ambience Giving 5 stars for the food , taste and ambience, Service is OK types but its a must visit"
4.0,One of those few places where you get decent North Indian food in this locality.  The butter chicken here is better than most of the places I have tried in Bangalore.
3.0,"This was a visit after 2 years from my last visit. Nothing got changed is my thought after the dinner. Little crowded, a long waiting line and no proper space for waiting area. The food was ok, seeing the crowd I had been expecting a real great deal here. The ambiance is good. I really liked the way the seats and cots were used for seating. Overall an ok experience, can improve in the way they handle the tables. And it would be really a great help if you could arrange something for people waiting outside."
5.0,"Even though we had to wait for almost thirty minutes to get in . The food was worth the wait . Seated in low floor chairs , the lassi was the most outstanding of them all. Every individual fish was yummy."
5.0,Amazing. Absolutely like home cooked North Indian food.Loved the ambience. Service was very quick. The food was served hot and fresh. We ordered desi ghee fulkas and panneer butter masala. The rates are in budget and with decent portion of food.
5.0,"We visited this place on recommendation of friends and believe me this is one of the best places in Bangalore serving authentic North Indian food., Since I am a Vegetarian Ordered For their CCDD Special Tikka & Stuffed Mushroom Tikka, and for Main course we Paneer Sitara & fulkas, Food had authentic taste and combined with Hot Ghee fulkas , one cant ask for more We had their lassi which is the best in Bangalore and believe me its true as my food cravings have taken me in most of the North Indian Joints and lassi of this place is the best  We will be soon visiting with family and friends"
1.0,"Food is a nightmare, they delivered fried rice with all left over chicken from the fridge, though the price was high, stingy people used left overs for online orders, worst taste."
4.0,"This place in aecs layout and on roadside.  It's a nice place. Ambience is nice and they have dhaba type setup. Food was good and can be improved. Service was good. Not on the expensive side.  Overall, Food taste 3 Service 4 Ambience 4 Value for money 4  Parking: Road side parking is available."
3.0,The food was ok. It could have been much better.. Read the reviews and went but the gravy paneer tikka and veg kofta were ok.. they were v mild spicy.. the quantity was very less compared to the of price. Lassi buttermilk were good to taste. The service was very late. The seats were not comfortable for tall people. Circular tables made it quite uncomfortable. Heard a lot about this place but the taste service seating could have been much much better.
4.0,I had been here for several times..Last Saturday went with my friends for dinner..A typical Punjabi restro and food was so yummy.. everything we ordered were so tasty..place is small a lil bit...As the food is very good and affordable price so the place filled so quickly.. very rush during dinner so table booking recommend..Must try KULHAD LASSI.. I just loved it..staff service is good.
4.0,"Recreates the exact ambience of a dhaba with rooftop seating arrangements, intricately lit and decorated interiors and even having traditional woven seats instead of sofas. Staffs are also dressed in ethnic attire and well mannered. Food quality is good with wide variety of items served in traditional way.  Ambience: 4.5 Food: 4 Varieties: 4 Value for money: 4.5 Staffs: 4.5 Management: 4 Decors: 4"
2.0,Ordered chiken methi and taste was some kind of medicine.. I have been in restaurant many times and had a good experience..But today was really bad.. please do not take customers foregranted and degrade service when some body is ordering and waiting for good food..
3.0,Pepper Kebab - 3 Garlic chicken - 3.5 Veg Sheekh Kebaba - 3.5 Chicken Kheema - 3 Paneer Kurchaan - 3  I liked food at Kammanahalli/Kalyan Nagar branch better.
3.0,"Food that we ordered was good, We ordered veg dishes and the taste was good. i feel the price is too much for the quantity they serve. Service needs improvement. Roti and naan tasted good. Curry needs improvement. Sweet lassi is a must try."
4.0,"Very tasty food and menu has good options. One of the best paneer tikkas eaten in Bangalore. Price is little on the higher side though. Ambience is good, resembling the punjabi nature. Gulab jamuns are yum. Mutton biryani was wowww!!!!"
3.0,I heard a lot about this place so finally thought to have a try..  As i entered this place it was a little different for sitting and thats what i liked about this place..  Now comes the food we ordered both veg and nonveg.. i liked the taste means cant commnt on this part because it was good and tastier even ww tried different starter as well.. but mushroom stuffed was too hot to handle means very very spicy those who dnt eat spicy dnt dare to have this item otherwise u will go to some other wrld..  What i didnt like was the service means taste was sweet and service was sour.. Not happy with the service as we keep on calling them and they were just ignoring .. whatever we were asking ww ve to tell them twice or thrice and it was very late ..  So hoping for the next time with good food and good service
2.0,Ambience is good but the food taste was not even okay. Dal Makhni- just okay Malawi kofta - very bad(couldn't even eat that) Chicken lollipop - good
2.0,Food quality had dipped a lot from the older days whereas price shoots up. Went with family but they spoil the party. I wouldn't recommend the Brookfield one as it wont worth it.
5.0,Amazing food and quick service. Had been here with my colleagues for dinner. Loved the tandoori chicken and chicken wings. Definitely visiting this place again.
4.0,"This branch is located on the road next to Brookfield Mall. They have underground parking facility. They have a rooftop as well as indoor seating options. As soon as you enter you get a typical dhaba style Ambience, even the staff are dressed appropriately.  Masala Papad - tomatoes and onions on roasted Papad, yummy and spicy. Veg Sheekh Kebab - average taste, could have been more spicy. This is served with onions and green chutney. Paneer Kofta gravy and ghee fulka - the gravy is bomb, very yummy, a must try. Buttermilk - a big glass with buttermilk to soothe your taste buds.  A value-for-money restaurant, would like to come back and try out all the dishes on the menu.  Food : 4/5 Ambience : 4/5 Service : 4/5"
4.0,One of the best restaurant in Bangalore ..taste is too good with respect to price..but you will talk about rash and table booking is difficult like Everest riding
4.0,Full Panjabi style dhaba....All food are good and best thing is Lassi...you should try this atlast. But one main problem in weekend you have to wait for getting seat.
4.0,Good for specifically Punjabi food. Every time over crowded. Booking is must or else you will not get a single seat. Good price and ambience add well
3.0,"Went for a corporate lunch there. Waited for an ho5ir or so for a table of 20.  It goes with its name of being a dhaba with proper dhaba setup tables and seating. Loved the decor there. Only problem was that there was too hot since we went at 1:00 PM. So ambience would be 3/5.  Starters and main course was scrumptious.They had authentic Dhaba Style authentic North Indian Food.So, food is 5/5.  But the price is towards higher side. So , price 3/5."
3.0,You can get good North Indian main course near Brookefield at this place. The starters were a bit disappointing. They serve huge lassi glass which was good. The service was quite lathargic. The sitting area was unique but not that comfortable.
1.0,I visited the hotel many times so you served very good quality food.But today first time I ordered food online and except butter naan all the other items were test less.Even the chicken was smelling.
1.0,"I would start with a positive note and accept that they have been creative with the ambience, i liked that. However, thats secondary to me. We go to a restaurant to eat not to take selfies. All the other things about the restaurant ruined my evening. 1. They have about 25 waiters and every single one of them wants to take your order. We were waiting for people there and in 5 mins five different waiters came to take order and we had to repeat the same words five times. 2. Once the food arrived, everyone of us was in shock by seing the quantity of the food. Considering the price, the quantity was way below everyone's expectations. 3. we thought may be they are serving great quality food and that could be the reason for less quantity. But we were absolutely wrong. We were four people from four different states and none of us liked the food. I asked to make the curry spicy, the chef poured green chillies in it. I laughed and cried at the same time.  Since I started with a positive note, I would like to end with a compliment. They serve good Lassi. Its tasty and rich. Thanks."
4.0,"Visited this restaurant on a weekday. We ordered paneer tikka, chicken 65, seekh kebab for starter, chicken 65 was delicious whereas seekh kebab was really bad in taste. Tried dal makhni, chicken tikka in main course. Chicken tikka was tasty. I didn't like dal makhni. Gulab jamun was really good.  Service was good and it's value for money."
4.0,"Used to be one of my favorites restaurants to have dinner with family and friends, the taste of food is just awesome and delicious. Previously , when I started going I am talking about a year from now the service was just perfect but nowadays the service has gone down to an extent which was not expected from Chulha Chauki da Dhaba. I visited the outlet one near Brookfield, Bangalore, the ambience is good and will give you a glimpse of Dhaba on the roof top. They mostly have waiting time as its mostly crowded on weekends and sometimes on weekdays as well. Waiters are friendly over here as well and the manager too as he manages the crowd with calmness."
4.0,"If you are looking for some authentic North Indian and Punjabi Dhaba style food in Bangalore with an ambience which is a mixture of rooftop restaurant and a Dhaba, and it does not burn a hole in your pocket, then Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba is the place you should visit. The rush you see in this place whether it is a weekday lunchtime or a weekend dinner is a testament to how good the food is. Starting from the starters to the main course, the food is extremely good here. Only thing I feel needs a lot of improvement is the servicehere.  Recently went there on a weekday evening with few friends for dinner. Initially, the place was mostly empty and we took a table outside on the terrace. Very quickly the place was packed and I was surprised to see the place almost full on a Wednesday evening when it was raining outside with a lot of traffic. Well, the food does most of the talking. They make some amazing Lassi, with which we started off the evening. The starters were absolutely delicious, especially the Paneer starters. Tried the Malai Paneer Tikka, CCDD Paneer Tikka, Chicken Afghani Kebab and ChickenSawariyaKebab. The CCDD Paneer Tikka, which is their speciality was simply the best with nice chatpataflavours. They even have a version in Chicken as well, I am going to try on my next visit for sure. The Chicken Afghani Kebab was also nice. The actual kebab tasted very similar to a Malai Tikka, but this one had a speciality with all the pieces covered in fried egg, just like an omelette. SawariyaKebab was pretty decent, but not special. In the main course, had Dal Makhani, Butter Chicken, Mutton Rogan Josh (it was the special for that day) along with Butter Naan, Garlic Butter Naan, Stuffed Kulcha and Ghee Rice. I would highly recommend the Butter Chicken here along with the Daal Makhani, one of the best I had in Bangalore. The Rogan Josh tasted well and mutton pieces were soft, but not much authentic. I prefer the Stuffed Kulcha(best among the bread options) over the Naans here. The main course dishes went well with the ghee rice as well. Finished the wonderful dinner with hot gulab jamuns. It would have been a little better it the jamunswere a little warmer. While leaving do not forget to have paan.  Overall a nice experience, but if they take a fewof the feedbacks with the service this place would be even better."
4.0,"I think there is hardly anyone in Bangalore who doesn't know about this place. I have been in Bangalore for past four years and this has been one of my favourite places to have great Punjabi Food.  It is the first restaurant I visited after coming to Bangalore and though I have been there numerous times, this is the first time I am actually writing a review.  So last Monday, after having a hectic day at work, we decided to visit here for dinner. Since we know how fast this place gets filled up, we got seated at 7:30 pm only.  We were too hungry to quickly ordered a Punjabi Lassi and roasted papad. I have always been a fan of their Lassi. Unlike most of the places which serve watery lassi, this one was thick and refreshing.  In starters, we ordered a Paneer Tikka, Lasuniya Kabab and Chicken Tikka. Paneer Tikka and Chicken Tikka were amazing as always. Lasuniya Kabab I felt was lacking in marination and could have been better. The feedback was well received by the staff.  In the main course, we ordered Malai Kofta, Dal Tadka, Garlic Butter Naan and Jeera Rice. Everything was amazing and delicious. Malai Kofta gravy could have been a bit better and thick. Garlic Naan as always was great.  They have only Gulab Jamun in Desserts, so we ordered that and trust me it was so damn good.  In the last, having Paan from the Paan Counter is the best ending to an amazing food that one can expect.  Overall, this is an awesome place to have Punjabi food with a desi ambience. Staff is well trained and service is quick. Cheers to the amazing Team and Management..!!"
4.0,"If you want to have good food and dont want to burn your pocket a lot then you can visit this place. They have parking area so no need to worry about that too.  They have half area as enclosed area and other half as balcony. Only problem with the balcony seats are that dusts keep coming to your table and if you leave your plate unattended it will be covered in dust for sure. To avoid this, they can keep fold-able shades which they can remove in the night to give you balcony effect but day time it has to be a closed area.  They have a wide variety in chicken and paneer as well. From their non veg section, I ordered Chicken lollipops and Malai chicken tikka. Chicken lollipops were really delicious and juicy but Malai chicken was very dry and chicken was chewy. From veg section, i love eating mushrooms so ordered their Today's special Schezwan Mushrooms. It was crispy and tasty. Also, I ordered Hara bhara kebabs and Stuffed mushrooms tikka. Mushroom tikka was really spicy and delicious. I you like eating spicy food then you can order without a doubt.  I also tried their kullhad sweet lassi, it was really good and worth a try. The price & quantity totally justify each other.  From the main course, I took Chicken biryani which was okay in taste. Also, I took Malai tikka gravy with garlic butter naan. The gravy was actually sweet in taste but tastewise it was good. At last we ended our lunch with their Gulab Jamun, which was really good in taste- soft and sweet. Overall, the food & service was good but only problem I faced was the dust. They should definitely do something about that."
3.0,Good place to hangout. Roof top arrangement with desi style khaats. Food looks delicious but can be improved on taste certainly. Worth visiting once at least.
5.0,"A perfect Punjabi style dhaba restaurant. On weekends, there is long queue of wait but it's worth it. Everything was perfect in taste, service, food quality and even ambience."
4.0,"An authentic Punjabi Dhaba ambience with manjis and chair seating. The food is almost there and the crowd is always there. Hard to find a place on the weekends without waiting, this place deserves what it does. A roof top ambience clubbed with an inner ambience, you are here to enjoy decent food. The only scope of improvement is the service, which lacks to an extent. ****************************************************  FOOD  We went for a fine weekday dinner. Decent crowd with nice roof top seating. Started with kullad lassi and must say it's more than good and a must have in this place. In starters we ordered a ccdd paneer tikka, a Malai paneer tikka, afghani chicken kebab. The paneer tikka is my favourite be it the ccdd one or the Malai one, with ccdd one being a mix of Malai and spice. Afghani kebab was a topped with egg omelette and good to have. In mains, we have had a butter chicken, a mutton rohan josh and a dal makhani. The mains were decent but could have been better if they are trying to serve the authentic ones. Not very authentic but good to have. The kulchahs were good in breads. In desserts we have had the Gulab jamuns to end it all with the paans. The paans were really good. Gulab jamuns were OK but not warm. ****************************************************  MUST HAVES  STARTERS - Paneer tikka (ccdd and Malai) MAINS. - Butter chicken, paneer butter masala and stuff kulchas. *****************************************************  OVERALL.

4.0,"Such is the charm of this place, very restaurants can match up. Authentic as hell, great ambience & even better food.  Though I prefer the starters as tad bit more than the Main Course but they are great as well.  Favourite drinks are the Jal Jeera & Butter Milk.  For starters love the Tandoori Chicken, Kalmi Kebab, Afghani Kebab & Sanwariya Kebab.  For Mains we stick to Mouth Lasooni which is absolutely delicious."
2.0,We had ordered 3 items for home delivery. Firstly the quantity is not much for the price. On top of that 2 of the dishes were made so spicy that we could not enjoy the dish at all!
4.0,"Chulha Chowki is one of the best dhabas in the Brookefield area. Easy to locate, ample parking but loads of waiting time. Weekends are jam packed and you might have to wait a little longer for getting a seat here.  I have been a regular here and I keep visiting over and again. This place serves lip smacking kababs, Naan, sabzi and lassis.  I was here for a quick dinner with friends & loved it. I started with Kulhad lassi & Lasuni kabab. The lassi is a must try here esp with the kulhad because the taste gets enhanced in those earthern pots. The Lasuni tikka was an average dish & I felt could have been better. I told the staff the same. Within no time, they replaced the dish and took feedback seriously. Yes, they work towards consistency. Then we replaced with Chicken Tikka which was brilliant.  In veg starters, we tried Paneer Tikka & Stuffed Mushroom Kabab. They were a bit spicy for my palet but I still love it every time I come here. The masala papad is to die for. Simple yet delicious.  Coming to the main course, it is my most awaited affair. We ordered Paneer butter masala, Dal tadka & Butter garlic naan. Typical Dhaba food is the comfort food for me. Trust me it is delicious and the dhaba food is something we all crave for right. This is the place.  We ended the butter laced dhaba food with some Lime soda and then Gulab Jamoon. Hot jamuns dipped in sugar syrup are a must after a great meal.   We then had the pans here. Overall it is a brilliant experience. We loved it.                                             foodgasmdiaries.wordpress.com"
4.0,"Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba in AECS Layout, Brookfield is a dhaba style ambiance with pocket-friendly food items. It is primarily meant for couples or larger groups than individuals as the food portion size is good for minimum 2 people & single person would end up with food getting wasted.  I really liked the Kulhad Sweet Lassi, Paneer Tikka & Stuff Mushroom Tikka quite filling though average in taste. Matar Paneer Curry & Dal Fry with Garlic Naan was simple, very homely & tasty. The single naan came in 3 cut pieces & was quite filling. I felt only Gulab Jamun in dessert menu was a disappointment & more options can surely help though when I had the gulab jamun, I really liked it.   I felt that the garnishing on lassi & food items could help & there is definitely a scope for better crockery which was classic steel plates. Valet Parking wasn't there at this place which was quite disappointing but given the rates they have & the portion size they are serving, it totally seems worth it. They serve pan (meetha & saada) which is a must try.   #ashishbansalfoodie                                             foodie.prorido.com"
4.0,"I visit this place regularly as it is near my office. Its a good place to hang out and the ambience is also good. The place has cots and small stools to sit. Staff is friendly and service is fast. Food quality and taste varies from time to time. My last 2 visits were good and had good food over here. The best part is matka kulfi. Chicken tikka was good. Mutton Dishes are good , the piece was soft and well cooked. Tried number of starters but found chicken chili to be best. Seekh kebab was very dry would not advise. Dal was not really good. Phulkas were soft and were served directly from pan. They have pan stall and make good pan as well. They only have gullab jamun in dessert and it is delicious. Must try place."
4.0,"Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Value for money - 5/5  Food was really good. Paneer Tikka was soft, tangy and delicious. In main course, matar paneer dry was perfect. However, dal makhni could have been better. Overall, it was value for money."
4.0,"Recently visited this place. It is located in brookefield. The ambience is dhaba-like and gives a rustic vibe. It justifies the dhaba in the name.  For starters, we ordered Paneer Tikka, seekh kebab and chicken 65. The paneer tikka was made well and tasted great. My friends liked chicken 65. It was tangy and delicious. Seekh kebab wasn't great, it could've been better and they should improve it.  For main course, we ordered matar paneer, dal makhani and tikka masala. The tikka masala was spicy with thick gravy and was terrific. Matar paneer was non spicy and it too was great. Dal makhani was disappointing and could've been better. For breads, garlic naan, tandoori roti and ghee phulka, all were up to the mark.  For desserts, Gulab jamun is the only option and it was delicious. Soft and well made. Haven't had such a good Gulab jamun in a while and it's a must try.  For drinks, ordered Lassi and butter milk. Both are their usp and were great. Overall I had a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend this place."
4.0,"I visited this place recently for dinner. The ambiance gives a feel of dhaba as it has wooden sitting stool and waiters were dressed up in kurta pajama.   Coming to food  Drinks :  Lassi - perfectly thick and delicious. They serve it in glass or kulhad  Butter milk : they added ginger and masala to it which made it great in taste.  Starter:   Chicken 65 - its a must try dish. It was very crispy and perfectly spiced .  Panner tikka : Paneer used was very soft and overall taste was good.  Seekh kabab: the core was very hard, we didnt like it. They can improve this.  Main course:  Chicken tikka : It was very spicy however the gravy and chicken used was good. My friends liked it a lot.  Mater panner dry : It was not spicy. Matar used was  sweet and soft. Overall taste was good  Dal makhni : We didnt like it.  It didnt taste like dal makhni. It can be improved.  Dessert :   Gulab jamun : it was mouth watering. You should try this. They only serve gulab jamun in dessert. They can add a few more dishes.   Service was bit slow. Staff was polite and friendly  Overall it was a good experience  and its value for money."
4.0,This restaurant is definitely one of the best restaurants offering North Indian food in Whitefield. I've been to the place over 5 times and never been disappointed. Though the price is relatively on the higher side as per the ambience but the food totally makes up for it.
4.0,"Ambience is greatly satisfying and the same with food. We ordered for CCDD Special tikka(veg), malai methi matar, paneer kofta, kulcha and fulka. I liked all the dishes, the items. Malai methi matar and CCDD Special folla are a must try."
2.0,The Restaurant serves good North Indian food for sure but in this day and age where the focus is on customer service and retention the management of this restaurant needs to definitely improve. For starters most of the times they are online for accepting orders.They do have a home delivery system and a number where one can call but the operates including managers are so rude as of they are serving food for free. Mind you the average cost of a meal for two is 700/- and the attitude of the staff is worst than a small time dhaba on the roadside. They refuse to deliver even in a radius of 1.5-2 Kms and behave in a manner in which they are the only restaurant serving decent food. Like I mentioned the food definitely is good but it can't come at the cost of such bad service. The service at the restaurant is equally slow and below par so visit this place keeping the kind of service to expect. There are definitely much more better options in the vicinity to choose from so make a right choice where food is good and service is good as well... Cheers
3.0,Too much spicy food
1.0,got wrong item delivered
1.0,the chicken biryaani was just okay. the chicken too didn't appeal to me. the salad given was not fresh.  it was just okay.
2.0,FOOD: The food was plain spicy. The chicken Kheema wasn't Kheema at all but rather a dish of shredded chicken like the one used for chicken soups.  AMBIENCE: The place has a good interior but all that was spoiled by the loud noise by all the people present. Rather I got an headache by the end of an hour that I was present there.  SERVICE: Slow. Plus missed out on a lime soda but didn't miss it in the bill.  VALUE FOR MONEY: I found the price a little extra for the quantity served.

3.0,"Ambiance - 2.5/5 Staff - 2/5 Service - 3/5 Food - 3.5/5 Drink (lassi) - 4/5  To start with , Lassi here is a must try . Have been to other outlets of this restaurant and this is the least favorable. Non Veg items are good as compared to veg items . Tandoori Roti was not good at all and that was a mood spoiler basically here ."
2.0,We came to this hotel around 9.20 p.m and order some non veg staters and veg staters and after than main course but it was served full cold pulka n naan was fully cold was not able to bite also. So pathetic food and served very late
5.0,"Great place, good ambience, delicious north Indian food with excellent sweet lassi. A must try for every North Indian at Bangalore. Every south Indian also should try for a change."
1.0,"I had already gone to the other outlet of this restaurant and hence went again to Brookfield outlet. The food was good but we were accompanied by the 'rat' while we were eating. The rat could be seen roaming freely in the restaurant. We had to leave the food unfinished and leave immediately. Hygiene standards are worse at this place and hence not at all recommended. Additionally, we informed the issue to the steward and the manager but we got laughs and very cold reaction. So not at all recommended."
4.0,"Have visited this outlet multiple times with my friends.  As the name suggests this place is designed to give the Dhaba feel. If you are lucky enough, then you might get a seat in the ""Khatiyas"" to embrace the complete Dhaba experience.  The staff is quick in their service. Good and polite in nature.  And the food is fully delicious. There is not a single dish which i tried and didn't like. Chicken Lolipop is delicious. Afgani chicken is a must try is you are bored of normal spicy chicken. Do not forget to have Lassi here. Though the lassi is quite heavy. Its hard to finish a complete glass after full meal.  There is no table booking available. So be ready to wait for a seat if you are planning to pay a visit in weekends.  The only reason for giving it a 4 star instead of 5, even after liking the place so much is that I find the place slightly costly based on the services provided and the area where it is located."
1.0,already specified  for less spicy but food was too spicy...
1.0,"Visited this outlet based on a friends suggestion and regretted it instantly. Too overpriced , below par quality of the food and everything is too spicy. A big no to anyone who wants to try this restaurant."
3.0,ordered dry mater paneer but got gravy.
5.0,Good place to have Indian food in Bangalore. The Naans and Kulchas are really good. They serve really great Lassi.  We recommend trying the Malai Chicken Tikka as a starter or Malai Paneer Tikka as a Veg option.
4.0,"Another delicious team party!! This restaurant is located close to Brookefield Mall and is usually packed during weekday lunch hours.  Being the non vegetarian monsters we naturally ordered quite many items.   Started with chicken wings chili which was surprisingly spicy and soo tasty. I am not really fond of chicken wings but this was completely a turner for me.  We next delved into kalmi kabab, tangdi kabab, and Afghani kabab. All three were amazingly good! I loved the tangdi kabab especially.   I tried to pick few bites from the veg platter and I have to say that chilli corn was  even tandoori paneer had that zing!  For main course, I went for chicken Afghani and tandoori roti. It was less spicy but still nonetheless good. Quantity was justified. Couldn't try the biryani or the lassi unfortunately. But my colleagues said that the lassi is worth.   Ambiance was okay. A bit congested area and felt uncomfortable sitting on those cane stools. But, the food made up for it.  Would recommend to have the mouth watering starters"
5.0,"Great manager . Real quality ingredients used for a nice food experience always .anil Sherawat if I remember the managers name Who is always available. Like their newly added mutton dishes , same as the other tandoor items"

4.0,"Been to this place as my friend/colleague wanted to eat at this place after her fasting. She told me many times that the food is very delicious over there and so I wanted to try it. The mutton in mutton biryani is succulent and juicy. Lassi is a must try, its thick and tasty. You can have your lunch/dinner while sitting on a cot like you are at your home. Loved the overall experience. There is on thing which I didnt like about the place. Too many mosquitoes in the evening time."
4.0,Food is good.Service is quick. Ambiance is nice. One very important thing please make a reservation before going especially on the weekends as it is way too crowded.
5.0,Awesome food with the awesome ambience. Loved it. Always make sure that you will reach to that place earlier because every time you will find a long queue in front of you.
3.0,"This place is situated in residential area of Brookefield.  Have been to this place a couple of times. First the positives of this place: - Great ambiance - Pure punjabi dhaba style, with seating on cots and bamboo stools. - Both veg and non-veg items are cooked in authentic Punjabi style. - Lassi in khullad and masala Jaljeera are good to try. Areas of improvement:  - Very less quantity for the price they charge - Very poor service. They have laid out too many tables in a small area, and hence struggle meeting out quick service requirements. - Too much of waiting and totally not worth the hype.  Overall, the experience here was good in terms of ambiance but, disappointing in terms of service & food quantity."
2.0,"Ambience is purely dhaba style. One side is open air ambience where we can sit on cot and chairs. Food taste is not that great. They will take too much time to serve the ordered items. Roti's were not at all hot, they served hour back roti's and ghee rice which served was half cooked. Service was too bad they took more than half your to serve each item."
3.0,A good place with good Ambience for dineout with people who love Punjabi food and Punjabi Dhabas. You will get the feel of being in one of the dhabas.
5.0,We tried veg food and its very tasty and pan at the end is very nice. Nice ambience. Kitchen is open which make kitchen side place li'l noisy. But all over nice experience.
4.0,Loved their chicken angara..place seemed conjusted...having dhaba ambience....cordial staffs....bit costly...we got the open air seat which was comfortable...will come again.
4.0,Nice place to hangout with friends and family. it's a Place with amazing Ambience. Nice experience dining here. The only disappointment is that they don't serve Fish. The staff is friendly and the dishes are very spicy here. Overall It's amice place to spend the time with friends.
4.0,"It's a good place but too much congested.  Food: 4.5 ( All dishes were tasty, especially lassi was awesome.)  Service : 3.5 ( it was very slow. Better order everything at same time, otherwise they takes hell lot of time to serve orders.)  Ambience : 4 ( but too much congested).  Worth spending my money."
3.0,"Food was very good, good ambience. , quantity wise it will be bit less comparing to other restaurants ... but I gave 3 rating for the bad behaviour of waiter...he was continuously staring at us that when we will finish and leave so that other customers can come as it was a peak time even though we dint even spend 30 mins there. We called him and asked whats ur pblm then after that also same behaviour without asking us whether we are done or not ...immediately he brought the bill... manager also responded the same way as waiter. They should take care of this."
4.0,"Nice ambience , but sitting arrangement needs improvement. It should be confirmation.  Food id good. Good to take more than once.  Nice service. Phulka can be improved a little"
4.0,"Great place to gorge on the north Indian delicasies. I've been here many times and I'm always satisfied. The quantity of the portions is less but no compromise in the taste. Must have- Achari chicken tikka. Avoid ordering dals, they don't taste that great!"
3.0,"Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba, Brookefield, Bangalore . Sunday dinners are usually out as my cook has a holiday on this day, which makes sense. So, we chose to have dinner at this place as the name attracted me. . Starting with the positives here: - Great ambience - seating on cots and sitting muddas(stools), giving Punjabi dhaba vibes. - Kullad lassi(sweet) is a must here - star of the evening - Achari chicken tikka - good starter to try . Areas of improvement: - Dal Makhni was not good at all, tasted nothing like it. Was not cooked well and lacked the creamy texture - Paneer Tikka could have been grilled better - Quantity of chicken in Butter chicken was too less. . Overall, the experience here was great in terms of ambience and disappointing in terms of food. . With Love Thetechnifoodie"
3.0,"Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba had been on my bucket list for a long time and I had many expectations from them. Excellent location, right on the main road its easily noticeable. A small lift takes you to this rooftop restaurant. It was Sunday night and the restaurant was packed up. There was a long queue waiting on the stairs. As I entered, I was quite impressed with the decor as it gave me that ''Dhaba waali feeling''. It has 2 seating areas- one inside and one on the terrace. The ambiance was lovely with latest Hindi numbers being played.   We managed to get table for four on the terrace. The seating was not comfortable like sofa but I enjoyed sitting on the rope beds and stools. The bamboo fenced wall and matching interiors looked very good. Light was little less but overall it blended well with the Dhaba atmosphere.  We ordered ''Kullad Lassi'' to begin with. Service was pretty fast and in no time we received the yummy elaichi flavoured thick lassis served on earthen kullads.   In starters we ordered the following:  Paneer Labaabdar- The marination tasted superb but I felt that the paneer needed to be grilled more. Portions were sufficient.  Achari Chicken Tikka- It really tasted good. Quantity of serving was decent.  In Main course we had the following:  Daal Makhni- It was not up to the mark. Daal makhni is a signature Dhaba dish and hence we had high expectations. Neither the consistency nor the flavour matched with the actual daal makhni. Quantity of serving compared to the pricing was less.  Chicken Butter Masaala- Again this is a signature Dhaba dish but gone wrong. It tasted like a very normal chicken gravy. Quantity of serving compared to the pricing was less.  Plain Roti- It was good and tasted like homemade roti.  Makke ki roti- It was again good.  Kulcha- Kulcha was done very nicely.  Overall it was a mixed experience for us. We loved the ambiance, the staff and the Lassi. But there is scope of improvement on the food part. Glancing at the menu we felt that the price is little bit on the higher side compared to the portions served.                                             diaryofmoments.com"
5.0,"One of the greatest North Indian food with North culture. You can sit in special area too having charpai Its feel very nice. I tried Todays special Paneer lababdar, trust me its having very unique paneer gravy taste and when seved with Sweet lassi in Pot glass is heaven. I strongly recommend this to North Indian Folks"
5.0,"Best place for north indian lover ! Must try : lemon chicken (starter) , Lassi and go for day special , you will surely love it . Pros : Heaven for north indian lover . All dishes are good and worth money , cheap Cons : If you hate waiting , Never go and I said Never means Never ()"
4.0,"The place exceeded my expectations. I guess was surprised by how the place looked and for what did it offer. I am amazed by the excellent service and outstanding quality of the food we Guys were served. Good, better, Best !!! Yeah, I can give them all three. I am a foodie and once again my core emphasis is on the quality and taste of the food that the place serves. Only Windmills has broken that norm for me until today. Anyways, yes it's mouth-watering North Indian food. Have anything what you want and you won't be disappointed. Just don't forget to order sweet lassi as the icing in the cake... Njoy Tandoori Chicken"
5.0,Wow food. Specially achari chicken .yum it is.. full Punjab Di feeling.. serves good. Taste good. And the que shows how good it is. Must try
4.0,"Authentic north Indian food with authentic ambience which gives u the right jolt of dhaba. The chowki, kullar, steel utensils and decor takes you the the roadside Dhaba experience of North India. Food wise starters are extremely good and well presented specially the chicken kababs. Veg dishes with special mention to dal with Desi her and palak paneer are standouts. Rotis and rice also are apt to the match the sides. Improvements - non veg main course gravy items could be better. Good and prompt service and nice seating arrangements."
4.0,The ambience in Chulha Chauki is fantastic. The open air dining experience resembling a dhaba and big earthen glass full of lassi may be just what one needs on a nice Friday evening...
2.0,"Food is good, ambience is bad. In trying to give an authentic dhaba feel they have made very uncomfortable seats with gravel on the floors. Very uncomfortable. If I'm going to pay a bomb for food, I need to be comfortable having it. Was very uncomfortable the whole time i was there. No legroom to sit. No back to the seats. Ridiculous. Might order but never go to eat here."
4.0,"This place is crowded always, algough food is decent i find it to be spicy. My friends who eat non veg like this place. Overall decent place to visit. Prefer going kn a week day"
3.0,"Visited recently. No doubt foods were awesome but what I realized here is, they were in rush a bit, we were having dinner and the waiter kept coming to us and asking about anything else you want? Oh man, if I would need anything I will definitely ask.. Actually he wanted us to finish our dinner as soon as possible and go.. We go to restaurants to eat peaceful and calmly. And they were indirectly forcing us to finish our dinner quickly by sending waiter continuously to us. We really felt bad. If you have so much people to accommodate then please increase your area so that people can eat properly. Otherwise everything is good.  Ambiance - 4 * Food - 4* Service - 3 * Price - 3 *"
4.0,Nice ambience and good service. There were so many varieties for veg & non veg both. Food was little spicy. But overall it's a good place for north indian cuisines.
2.0,Not a worth going here. Taste is ok only. Its gud if u visit a normal dhaba  Waiting time is ridiculous. No proper seating arrangements.The theme of the restaurant will flaunt u.its better if u book one day before you come to this place.
4.0,Proper rural Indian feel with good North Indian food. Amazing ambience and good music. Waiting is an issue but all in all a good place to hangout with friends any time of the week.
5.0,"Visited this place many times. Its mostly crowded all days. Long wait in time, but its really worth it. Food and ambiance both are perfect. The rates are also very reasonable."
3.0,Well this is a place where you go casually . The place is good to meet friends for dinner or something. North Indian food is what you get here . Quality is not persistent !! I had my fare share of good and bad experience. It's not fine dining so I won't give lot of negative criticism. Price wise is easy on your pockets.
1.0,Very bad service. The so called manager of the restraunt thinks he is the owner and is very rude and arrogant. He has absolutely no manners how to talk to the customers. They kept us waiting for an hour and after that when I asked that I need the food ready in 5 minutes he still said I cannot assure you. And was very rude. You are serving people food you should have some respect for that. Worst experience ever. Wont ever visit again
1.0,"This used to be the place to go for us. In the last 2 visits a bit disappointed. Still good but that edge it used to have is missing. May be they changed the chef. No longer ""the"" place to go. It is just one of the many restaurants."
3.0,Ambience is like that of a Dhaba which is appreciated. Food is good enough but I feel the prices are too much even the portion they serve is not sumptuous.
4.0,Late post....nice ambiance...we ordered 2 chikcken curry n 2 veg curry...and 3 starters the starters are awesome.but chicken curry was too spice after all food taste are better...nice place for hangout with friends....
4.0,Nice place in the near by area to hang around with friends and family. The taste and presentation of the food is great. Ambience of the place is nice. Overall it is a great place to skip home cooked food on weekends and being surrounded by the residential properties makes it very much accessible.
5.0,"This is the best place in AECS Layout area for amazing north Indian/ Punjabi food! I can go even on the last day of the month without fear as they are so affordable! the taste is too good! I order most of the time for home delivery as there's always a huge waiting line for seating arrangements. But did also sat and ate their quite sometimes, a pretty nice ambiance! Overall, you should go!"
4.0,"A unit hidden inside the road, which we explored after people recommended it for North Indian food.  Its on the roof top,with dhaba kind of setting and sitting. The servers for the table were good and knowledgeable along with courteous.  We were happy to eat there.  Hole in pocket - 400/ head"
3.0,This place used to be a saviour for my North Indian hunger till an year back but not the same now. The quality of service and the quantity of food has been decreased drastically. Ambience is kind of a mirror image of dhaba on a rooftop with bamboo furniture. The food used to be good but is now just ok. Also the quantity of the food is decreased. I order lemon chicken and what i got was 4 piece of chicken slices only. Chicken masala was just a small bowl not enough for 2 people. Not happy with the quantity at that price of dish.
4.0,"While I had heard tall tales of this place, Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba was never on my list of places to try. It was pretty sudden and quite unexpected that I decided to meet my friends for dinner at this place on a Friday night. And I am so glad I did.  Honestly it is some of the best food I have had in months. For starters we ordered Lemon Chicken and Reshmi Kabab. The lemon chicken was gorgeous and an absolute delight and precise to the very last taste. The Reshmi Kabab came enclosed inside a thin layer of egg and was good though nowhere as great as the lemon chicken. The Mutton Lasunhiya, a special of the day, was another excellent main course with the mutton thoroughly cooked to its very core. I had thought that the garlic would overwhelm my senses but it was perfect with the right amount of spices toning down the garlic to a flavour just right for the mutton.  Team the mutton with some hot steamed rice if you love rice as much as I do. And with some dal tadka and masala pappad, it was a real satisfactory dinner that reminds me of home. The only disappointment was the lime soda which was too sweet for my taste. Prompt service and really cheap rates is a plus for this amazing place that definitely deserves good ratings.                                              anaffairwithflavours.wordpress.com"
4.0,"Have been here twice. But both my experiences has been, just average. With such great rooftop ambience, I expected the food also to be equally good. But it was below my expectations.  What I did like: 1. Malai paneer tikka 2. Kullhad lassi  What I did not like: 1. Tawa veg 2. Veg kofta curry  Update: I am increasing the rating from 3 to 4 star because of past 2 great experiences. This time I had ccd special paneer tikka which was somewhat similar to malai paneer tikka and methi malai matar which was divine.  Keep it up guys!"
1.0,"Went back to this place as my first visit was wonderful. But this time i had a completely different experience and not in a good way. To start off, I've always felt like the seating is very uncomfortable at this restaurant, I understand that they need it to make the ambience look more like a typical dhaba but one has to look for comfortable seating as well. I had a horrible back pain after sitting there, to ass to this, the food was not even half as good as it was the last time. This was an even bigger let down, I got served cold food and there was no value for money. The place was filled with mosquitoes and there was no proper fans that made it even worse to wat there. Honestly I don't recommend this place for anyone and I hope anyone in their right mind won't go here."
2.0,"Go to chulha chauki if you want a stiff back - in the guise of being rustic - they break your back wit horrible seating the food used to be good whenever we did home delivery, but was surprised by the quality of food when we went there to dine. Tasteless food - literally wasted the entire order -"
3.0,"First thing menu is not upto date.We ordered veg seekh,chicken reshmi kabab but it was just ok and nothing great.Mutton biryani took quite a lil time to be brought to the table(made us feel like it was brought from someother restaurant). Uncooked jeera rice was a surprise. so now things which are expected in dhaba were fine the chaaz,lassi, breads and curries. Ambience: 4.0 Food: 3.25 staff: 3.7"
4.0,"Roof top restaurant, good taste, decent dhaba style ambiance & good service. Daal, paneer is recommended! Must visit if you are near. Weekend may have rush, parking is limited!"
4.0,Food -4/5 Ambience-4/5  overall experience was good . Went on dinner with my friends last week . Food taste is good and the ambiance is properly done with dhaba theme . you may experience late food serving because of the crowd in the weekend time..
2.0,"Preparation is average,veg kolhapuri they serve should be removed from menu,it is absolutely un-eatable and feels like the restaurant is trying to take some kind of revenge.It is so spicy that you will have to leave it uneaten. They also do not accept Amex which is again a thumbs down."
4.0,this place is located on the top floor and the ambience is good with a dhaba feel. the service is decently fast. the prices are slightly high. the taste is good. overall a good place.
4.0,"Been here couple of times and every time, Food tastes good- 4.5 Quantity is also up to Mark 4.5 Ambience 4 Staff 4 Overall- 4 I would like to visit again and again"
3.0,"The food taste was good, except the mutton biriyani. The service was very slow. I asked for the menu several times despite of plenty servicemen, the were just looking at each other. Poor service. No cooling system also in summer."
4.5,"Went there with my friend Deepak for a casual Sunday dinner. Got to tell you, the place is very famous in the neighborhood. Had to wait 20 minutes to get the table, but in retrospect, I believe that it was worth the wait. Extremely courteous staff and a good amount of dishes on the menu made it a very positive experience. I have listed all the food items we had during our visit and my personal recommended dishes which are must-haves at Chulha Chauki on my personal blog. The link to the blog inpersuitoffood.blogspot.in/. Do visit the blog to get an overall view of the restaurant and the recommendations"
4.0,I have visited this restaurant couple of times...as the name suggests the ambience reminds u of a dhabha...it's different experience to enjoy the dhaba kind of sitting arrangement...love the lassi here..the non veg tandoori dishes are good..
5.0,"This is must go place for dhaba style north indian food, tandoor, non veg mainly, lassi and the best dal tadka I ever had in my life. So u Shud try all this items."
3.0,"Had been there for once in a weekend. Ambiance and food is good but place is very crowded. You got to wait around 30-40 minutes queue in weekends. Apart from this, I didnt like their service as well. If you call their staffs either they knowingly wont listen else say coming in few minutes but will come after 10-15 minutes. I am not happy with their response."
5.0,Had been to the same outlet which is at JP Nagar! loved it there... and the love continues! you guys are awesome. dhaba as the name says. they prove it right! the food is amazing here. those rotis! the sabjis! the ambience. worth every penny. keep up the good work guys. follow for more food reviews. if you liked this review please give a thumbs-up below!                                                                 bakasuraforever.in
3.5,"Although its quite a struggle to find a table in this place, but the food makes up for the long wait. Would really prefer to come here on weekdays, because on weekends, the queue starts at the ground floor !!  Would highly recommend their Kababs, and the lassi in earthen pots !! If only they would get a reservation system, could go their more frequently."
3.0,The food was good in quality.However the bread could have been a little better and softer....loved the ambiance of the place(we got a table on outer side).
3.5,"Good north indian food. If you want to have a good roti-dal meal, step ahead!  What we had- Dal makhani, masala papad, shahi korma, paneer corn masala, CCDD special tikka(paneer), baby corn munchurian, garlic butter naan, missi roti and lassi.   Must have- masala papad, paneer corn masala. Paneer is definitely a must have.   Just confirm whether the lassi is cold or not before ordering!"
5.0,"We had heard abt this place for long so decide to pay visit this weekend for dinner ,The place was crowded whch shows the popularity of this place, we got our turn after 25 mins as promosed by manager we ordered Kalmi Kebab, Chicken pepper, Chicken Lasooni, kulchs and lassi. All were found to be near perfect and made our evening . food was found to be fresh and right blend of spices also their lassi is awsome. recommend must try to all of my friends Service is little slow but accurate maybe because of the crowd, rest everthing was good"
4.0,Simple and rooftop experience with a mixed flavour of old times. It can be easily located and the food was upto the mark. Although it was a bit crowded on weekend and the service was a little delayed.
2.0,"slow service, long wait time on weekends and ok food... not worth the time. we went there 3 times hopeful that we would get better service but no improvement.. we tried their HD which was ok.. faster than eating in here."
3.0,"I have visited this place Multiple times. Though it is very crowded, found the service to be bit slow. Food:  I like the chicken kababs of this place. The main curry are full of masala and spicy. Will be liked by those who are fond of eating spicy food. I dont eat spices so much so find most of the cuisine to be okay.  Ambience:  Set in a dhaba theme . The place is good but there is lack of space between two different sitting. It gives the look of being a chaotic place. It can be visited once in a while if you love spicy food or is fan of kababs."
4.0,Ambience is good. Suits Punjabi theme. Though khaats are few and you have to wait to dine on khaats.  Food is good. Must try baby corn Tikka. Quick service. Prompt staff.  The only thing I didn't like was songs. They were playing old sad songs. Playing Punjabi songs would energizes and suits the theme. Overall a nice experience. If you like spicy North Indian food then must visit here.
4.0,"i would have rated them 5 if they had good ventilated place to sit and comfortable place for customers to seat. food is up straight good and staff services too. A good place for people who regularly eats out and vegetarians or non vegetarians, both could enjoy this place"
3.5,They serve authentic North Indian Cuisine .The place is a rooftop restaurant and u can get an authentic Dhaba feel.Prices are slightly expensive. Must try:lassi
3.5,"If you do not mind waiting for half an hour for decent food, good ambiance and slow services then this is worth it. Otherwise lots of other decent place nearby where yiu can get food immediately.  Can try once or go during non peak hour."
3.0,"Being a regular at chulha chauki da dhaba in J.P. Nagar for more than 5 years, didn't hesitate to pay a visit here.  The ambience is decent- dhaba themed. Now comes the sad part the waiting here. I did anticipate it as I had to wait close to an hour in JP nagar one some time back. Well didn't mind, as I wasn't hungry and I knew the food tasted well. The roti, curries we're all good. But the crowdpuller is the Lassi we get here. I usually have 2 of them. The place is overly priced for the quanity served. Staff were good like always.  Recommend this place for a good North Indian cuisine and definitely don't go if you hate waiting(table and then food)."
4.0,"The look and feel of this dhaba style restaurant is very pleasing. Service is quick, staff is courteous. Food is definitely good, one of the best North Indian I have had in Bengaluru. In all a nice place to to chit chat with tasety food."
4.0,We had lunch last week in full North Indian dhaba style. Had to wait a bit longer to get those dhaba style sitting arrangements on the terrace. But worth it. Don't miss the lassi. I loved the masala stuffed kulchha
3.0,"12 times visited . I love your CCD special Kababs and adraki chicken. Briyani is not that great , chicken is too cheewy in that. Lassi is good. Please improve your Tawa sabzi. -1 for manhandling the waiting customers, behave like you guys have waited for 2 hours. Suggestion encourage people to take away or put some mouth fresheners at waiting area."
4.0,"This is like our neighborhood place but we don't go here generally and thought of going on 14th for dinner. The moment we entered the place outside, the corridor n stairs everything is filled with people waiting for their table. They don't take reservations and the average waiting time is around 30 mins.  After we ordered food, it didn't take much time for preparation. First was masala papad n jaljeera. Papad toppings were too spicy n jaljeera was little more salty with no sugar.  For starters we had malai paneer tikka which was really nice. And mains we ordered paneer butter masala with breads. The taste of gravy is different with little more garlic than I prefer but otherwise it was fine. One starter n one mains is more than enough for too people n reasonably priced. For all this the damage was around 650."
3.5,The food here is good ambience is good. On my part I personally think the quantity they serve is a bit less. Rest service ambience food on taste and rest is upto mark.
1.0,If you want to feel your angry sister's food then go and dun enjoy. I ordered sweet lime but I got lime with garlic taste.yo yo . Right now I am here and enjoying others foods.   .... Food is average... Dun come for Ambience....
5.0,"I went with my friend here. In my opinion, this is one of the best options for north-indian food in Marathahalli. We ordered Paneer chilly and CCDD special tikka in starters. Both excellent, specially the Paneer chilly. In drinks, both salted lassi and sweet lassi were super-awesome. Lassi was thick and fresh. Just like, they serve it in Punjab. In main course, we ordered Veg kofta curry, Veg Raita and tandoori rotis. Raita and rotis were awesome. Kofta was also nice. There is pan waala also sitting right inside the restaurant. We had pan afterwards. Overall, I found this restaurant to be good on all parameters- Ambience, Price, Quality, Taste and Service."
5.0,Chulha chuuki Da dhaba it's a great weekend which osom we had to wait for 30 before gating in Now coming to food  We veg seekh kabab Dall makhanie ect  Tandoori chicken it was excellent prompt response Service And best of lassi ar awesome We will visit again
3.5,Proper Rajasthani and punjabi food. The staff here is okey. But what i love about this restraunt is the theme. You get feel of proper dhaba like that in the north. Food is nice. Lassi is the best.
4.5,Recently visited this place. Though little pricey. The ambience makes you feel like you are in a original dhaba. Food tastes good. Their Kulhad lassi is a must try. Overall happy being there...  Ambience - 5 Food - 4.5 Quality - 4.5 Service - 4
3.5,KULHAD LASSI!! They serve definitely the best lassi in this part of town. That one kulhad of sweet lassi with perfectly creamy consistency of malai with the right amount of sweetness can do wonders. It's a very economical restaurant serving tasty North Indian food. You do get some Indo-Chinese starters but I wouldn't vouch for that. SAWARIYA CHICKEN and CHICKEN MAKHANWALA is a definite thumbs up. CHICKEN ANGARA deserves a disclaimer (check photos).
3.5,Food is 3/5 Ambience is 3/5 Service is 3/5 Food is avg for vegetarian people..  Service is slow.. Need to improve on service.. They take time even in billing..
4.5,"Visited the place couple of time, their Non-vegetarian starters are to die for. My personal favourite is the Afghani Kebab .  If you love the desi flavour in your food then this is your destination."
2.0,"After seeing the pics from zomato of Chulha chauki da dhaba and being a rooftop and punjabi dhaba theme i was excited to visit in person .  But it was a disappointing experience in every terms food , ambience and service .  For a rooftop resto i expect to have a good night view of the city and cool breeze but you cannot as it has a higher boundary walls and it was raining that day so we had to go inside and eat .  They have mentioned in the menu to wait for around 20 minutes when u place an order which is a good thing but the service staff was not attentive at all .We had to call him multiple times just to place an order and literally have to go near him and pay the bill .  Also their seating is not comfortable and its too close for privacy or comfort . If you get some annoying person nearby where you are seating you just have to bear it for the whole time .  Now coming to the food , i ordered only veg items and it was average nothing special . Maybe their non veg food is gud which i have to try once to know why all the hype and buzz around this restaurant ."
4.5,"I personally have found very few places in Bangalore that serve great North Indian food. This place is one of them. With a dhabha styles setup, it's a place you should definer try if looking for a nice dal tadka or other North Indian delicacies."
1.0,"If there would have been any option for negative review,I would have given - infinity. Worst food worst hospitality. Nothing special about the ambience , this place has all the hype for mediocre reasons. I personally didnot like the attitude of the manager and the waiter of the brookfield branch that i visited today. I would never visit this place ever."
1.0,"Worst restaurant ever.Their hospitality sucks. Inhuman behaviour at peaks,their waiters argue with you if you ask them to bring the food to the table after you have waited for more than an hour. We had ordered 2 chicken starters 1.kalmi kabab 2.kasturi kabab , for which they charge 189/- and serve only 3 small pieces with worst taste. Then we ordered stuffed kulcha which was another disappointment,please never order chicken makkhanwala , chicken lahori was average. Garlic naan was good . We went today i.e; Wednesday evening at 9pm , got our food at 10:30pm that too after so much begging, as if we were eating food for free, We paid around 2400/- and it was worth nothing, My friend's birthday was ruined. I confirmed the manager, who doesn't even know how to treat their customers that we will never visit this place ever again. Stop behaving as if it's the only restaurant in Bangalore. Morriz serves way better food than you that to with a legit price to quantity ratio and also great hospitality. I would never visit this restaurant .Fed up!"
5.0,"Had been here many times. Order anything and it's just great or least good. We specially like Lasuni Chicken, Aaloo Methi. And if you are health conscious I even like Veg Saagwaala. I didn't image it to be good. But it was infact tasty for me."
2.5,Food is ok we ordered panner tikka masala and Punjabi chicken... Both the gravies were same with no taste difference... Starters were below average with high price tag... And the place is too crowded during weekends.  Food : 2 Ambiance: 3+ Service: 3+
3.5,"An average place to eat out. We had to wait for around 30 minutes before getting in. When we entered, the ambience was average. The name has dhaba in it but the place didn't look anywhere close to a dhaba. It was just a packed Punjabi restaurant.  Now coming to food, we ordered veg seekh kabab, which was okay. Tandoori chicken was not properly cooked and the chicken was not cleaned properly as it had some blood on it. In main course, we ordered methi malai matar, daal makhani and panner capsicum. Methi malai matar and daal makhani was good but panner capsicum was not at all up to the mark. Also the service was fast once the first serving arrived. At the end the sweet lassi is what I think I should call the speciality of this place. That was awesome and one of the best lassi to find in Bangalore"
4.5,"You want great food at a very decent price or let's say extremely pocket friendly price, go to this place. This place is so famous you've got to make a queue. Almost every day there are people waiting for a table. The interiors are in a proper punjabi setup. Too good, this place is too good. It's heaven for punjabi food lovers."
3.5,"Didn't have much expectations when my wife dragged me here. But have to say, the food is quite decent. The ambience is Dhaba like. Among the dishes we ordered, the Mushroom tikka, Butter kulcha and Chaas were spot on. Would love to visit again and try out their non veg options."
2.5,Food is ok but they took so long to prepare food. 50 minutes for one normal order. Staff is rude. Ambience is ok.. Lassi is must try.. not happy with service
4.0,"This place is quite close to my residence and this is the reason I have visited it quite a many times and never have been disappointed with their food. Though finding a table here in weekends are like fighting for freedom, but it is worth the patience.  I have tried many dishes in both veg and non-veg and have found both cooked perfectly. Never I miss trying bhindi here.  The ambiance is cool, not the inside part though but the small set up with the typical Punjabi dhaba is always preferred.  Keeping the crowd in mind the service has to be fast and it is. The price is not very high or low so it's another addon.  Food- 5 Ambiance - 4 Service- 4 Value for money - 4"
4.5,Again filled my heart to content.  Showstopper Kulhad lassi did the magic once again wih awesome Lemon Chicken as starter.   Extra spicy Chicken Angara with butter Kulche was apt. .  Would be there soon again.
2.0,Was a big fan of jp nagar branch.order panner tikka turned out to be really bad.naan was also not that great..but the lassi as usual was heaven!
4.0,Ambience here is very good. Staffs are very friendly and service is upto mark. Food quality is also good but is on a little costlier side. In all it is a place to visit with your friends and family for having a good food. Butter chicken is my favourite at this place and you should also must try lassi here.
5.0,"Yummy food. You order anything and you will never be disappointed. For ones who have not visited yet, go and enjoy the food. Paneer butter masala and stuffed kulcha are my favourite."
4.0,"Ambiance is good. It has a Dhaba theme as the name suggests. ""Lassi - must try! "" One of the best I had. Ginger chicken and Chicken tikka Awesome! Butter chicken  simply delicious!  In veg kadhai paneer,  dal tadka and phulka is tasty  ghar ka khaana.  Food is generally a bit spicy here. So, if u don't like spicy do tell them in advance. This is probably the best place in Brookfield for lunch plans. Worth your lunch money! But do  plan accordingly .. as sometimes may have to wait to get a table."
4.0,Choices are not too many but what they serve is great to taste and to pocket too. Arrive early to get a seat or be ready to wait as it's always full.. specially at weekends.
4.0,"Been here around 2 months back with office friends for dinner and the place was bustling with food and people. Had heard a lot(both good and bad) about this place eventually decided to have a point of my own. First things first, they have managed to create a dhaba ambiance on the rooftop which is a plus. We had ordered mushroom tikka, Methi malai matar, paneer babycorn masala, Aloo-Gobi parathas, some normal breads and ended it with kulhad lassi sweet.  All the items were top of the chart and sweet lassi really summed it well. Our only issue was that service was pretty slow and the order was mishandled, besides this, food was good."
4.0,"I totally like the setup/(theme) of the place...service is quick, that's my favorite part!! Lassis' and chaanch are must try..its reasonable!!"
3.5,The first thing you will think of once you arrive at the hotel is where to park your vechile as it at a building whose all floors are occupied by restaurant and is always cramped. Once you sort out the parking the next thing which will greet you here is you have to wait for your turn. After enough of struggle you get a table but the seating is not upto my liking as you will not enjoy the food with the typical seating style they offer apart from the KHATIA seating. Staff is courteous but not all of them and they lack the welcoming smile.  Coming to food you will find a good Verity to choose from. Going by my experience you should not ask for tawa roti as they prepare it before. Dal tadka is good so as the chicken dish with no specific dish to point at. Lassi is worth trying. But I personally feel the place is a bit over priced.  Ambiance: 2/5 Staff : 2/5 Food quality:3.5/5 Food variety: 4/5 Value for money : 3/5
4.5,Really nice food and at great price. We finished with 600 Rs for 2 adults which included a starter and one main course n a drink. Ambience is totally traditional and is really good to see. The tables rrranged nicely and on weekends the place sometimes need 10-15 min waiting for dinner. The service is quite fast which is what is actually in the dhabas.
4.5,"Been here multiple times and by far this is one of the best restaurants within AECS layout. They offer great food at a budget price with pretty cool seating arrangement.  The food on the menu is typical north Indian that you should expect from a Dhaba style restaurant with amazing taste. To compliment that, the ambiance is very suited to their title. One have an option of normal table chair seating and an open terrace with 'Charpai'. The staff is very attentive as well."
3.0,Chulha Chauki is a good place to have North India food. I ordered online and have been to this place and i found a difference in taste. Loves their Kalmi kabab but however their Chicken Punjabi and Paneer Tikka were not good. Maybe because of 31st Eve ? However I liked the food at the restaurant.
4.0,"The best dhaba in Brookfield area with a rooftop dine in and typical dhaba set up where u literally sit on a knitted cot . Feels so comfortable to chit chat n share your food in such set- up .coming to the food , asli Punjabi is one word to describe the food served here . Chicken Tikka n kebabs are a must try here .. Garam gulab jamuns and chilled lassi will Kindle your taste buds"
4.0,"Nice location, ambience and food. The service was also good. Food is bit costly but worth visiting. They have started home delivery also recently"
4.5,"The AWESOME place for a non-vegetarian! Have a great variety in food options. Nice sitting. Have an open sitting area as well, has a theme of a punjabi dhaba near highways. Service is little sloppy but ambiance reminded me of my college times. A good place to hangout."
3.0,Ambience is simple but gives you a road side dhabha feel. Lassi is super tasty. Dum aalo is yummy. I did not like phulkas as they were really not phulkas. Egg parantha was disappointing. Apart from all this there was huge waiting queue we were told to wait for 15 mins but ut turned out to be 40 mins. The good part was they had waiting muddhas outside so you can sit and relax while you wait. Overall an average experience.
4.5,"I came here just this once for a friend's birthday. The food was surprisingly delightful and tasty. The ambiance is very comfy and pleasant (i found the lighting to be a bit shady but it's not at all a deal breaker). The service is a bit slow (irrespective of the crowd and queue), but in the end its worth the wait. Authentic north Indian cuisine complete with starters."
4.5,Totally mesmerizing experience......... typical north indian taste.............loved the pro rural Indian theme.............. great service.........highly recommended
4.0,"Food is tasty, price is low and seating arrangement is like a dhaba in terrace. What else do you want? Do recommend this place for casual dinner."
1.0,Restaurant is always crowded. You will have to be on time to get seat and still you will have to wait for min half an hour. Last time we went and we had to wait for approx an hour. The service was pathetic. Naan was cold. Earlier this place was good but now with the crowd this is becoming a money wasting place.
4.0,Well a Punjabi Dhaba like experience .Option to sit and enjoy you food under the sky on desi khatiya.I have been there multiple times mostly on team lunches as my office was nearby.I liked food everytime I have been there.Specially their spicy chicken curry items.Starter not that great but except few items.I used to have egg chilly..And of course lasso and paan when you are done..Overall a decent experience..
4.0,"It's nice place, you will find typical dhaba look. North Indian food is good in taste. I had veg food it was tasty food, I don't have any comments on non veg food.  They can improve in service, I found service was slow specially for tandoori item.  Overall It was good food with nice dhaba look like khatia,  muddi, lamps etc.."
5.0,"Been here quite sometime and loved it every single time. So the last visit was no different. The dhaba style theme is spot on and we settled up for the ""Khatia"". But mind it you have to go really early(12:30pm) around or else you gonna miss it.  Comming to food, we ordered kalmi chicken kabab, gobi manchurian for starters, main course was ghee rice, butter nan, chicken dahiwala and malai kofta. All of them were delicious. As I dont like much spice in my food I asked to make it less spicy and they made it. At the end we went for khullad Lassi and that was orgasmic. It was so so delicious even word cant decribe it.I am definitely going back even if I wany just to have the lassi and you too if you have nt."
5.0,One of my favorite places in AECS. It gives a proper Dhaba feel. My favorite dish here is Malai Kofta. I always confirm its availability before going
4.5,"Amazing! Service is good. The people who work there pay full attention and serve hot food and specially the fulkas. You must try the handi lassi if you have the appetite. :) its best if shared between two.  Suggestions - If you want to have dinner over weekends, you should reach the place by 7.30 PM to avoid the queue. Theres always long waiting time if you reach post 8 PM.  Lunch hours dont have any waiting"
1.0,Had a pathetic experience on my last visit. The staff were so arrogant and impolite. The food quality has degraded from what it was earlier. Not to speak of the quantity. And the service was downright disaster. Absolute NO NO in the future.
3.5,"Headed here due to its rating but found it not up to the mark.  Food and Price: Prices are not much high but food was not up to the mark.  Ambiance: Typically dhaba kind of ambiance. they have open area as well but to get it you need to wait or book. Found it little congested as well.  Service: This was a good part, Service was fast. Even on second order they brought order fast  PS: If you like Punjabi flavor food and dhaba kind of ambiance then this can be a try for once"
4.5,Nice place to hang out with your friends and family. Food tastes great and restaurant has very nice ambience. If you go on weekends you need to wait for 30 odd minutes to get a table.
4.5,Yesterday night me and my friend went to this awesome restaurant.  1. Ambiance was superb 2. Food was good. 3. But the staff guys are speaking in Hindi it was little bit problematic for me. 4. Nice environment 5. Price is too much expensive but OK with that.  Thanks for having an such an wonderful food over here and also thanks to zomato
4.0,hi..iam going to give detailed review.. overall food is good and cost effective.. ambience is good with open roof too... cons are..place is most crowded..hv to wait in que fr long hours..coming before 8pm is good..
5.0,"Good place to have food regularly,  value for money food n place, Really awsome authentic yummy food, Wanna try every thing on menu . . . Smitha Prasad"
4.5,"Awesome food. Had missi roti, phulka, paneer khurchani, veg dry, Gobi Manchurian and butter milk. Everything had an authentic real taste with great quality. Ambience here is also very good of that if dabha. Overall had great foodie experience and value for money. :) Ishwar Prasad K"
5.0,"Today was my fifth day in Bangalore and i discovered one of the nicest eating joints in Bangalore. I ordered Lassi,Kalmi Kebab, Dal Tadka. Lassi was heavenly and kalmi kebab was one of the best i have eaten,the right blend of spices and perfect roast. Their Dal Tadka is the best as you will remember home cooked food and garlic tadka in it was utterly delicious. The manager and the staff were very friendly and treated us very nicely. If you want to have pocket friendly and finger licking food, this is a must visit place and you will never be disappointed.and best thing is the ambience with their Khatiya and outdoor seating. Thank you chulha chauki da dhaba for the heavenly food and exemplary service."
4.5,"Super seating, awesome food. Make a booking well in advance to get a table. It has an amazing dhaba feel, a treat for north indians in bangalore!"
4.0,The food was very spicy and everything was good. Nice place to hangout with your friends and enjoy typically punjabi items. Furthermore they have different seating arrengments like highway dhabas.
1.0,They are allowing people after 10:30pm and keep on annoying them by saying last order.. I didn't like the behaviour of the waiters working there with the manager.
2.0,"Have been to this place a couple of times but today was the worst experience. Had to wait for a table for about 40 mins and then after we got the table, even after 35 mins the food was not served. We were expecting the starters at least in 15 mins but it was never served. After 30 mins on asking the staff they said that all your order will be served together. The staff are very rude and if you want to screw up your precious evening or night then please visit this place."
1.0,Visited today!!! First time in my life...to have such a worst experience.We waited for an hour to get our table for 2. Ordered 2 lassi Malai panner Tikka and pepper chicken and fried rice and bhoondi Raita. We waiting patiently for our order for 35 min and all we get is bhoondi raita with a sarcastic smile as if we were beggars and we asked for food and one of the server replied wait Karna padega very rudely while the others who came after us were actually finishing their dinner.We almost waited 45 minutes to get food but we didn't all we get is arrogant looks from the staff as if we were eating for free.Pathetic pathetic pathetic service and they don't even care about customer. I really don't know if the management is really interested in taking some action because many of my friends faces same issue.  Such pathetic place to visit. What is the point of serving good food when you don't know how to treat customers???
5.0,Amazing food. Though the quantity was less whatever was served was amazing! Food was served in steel plates. Probably to make it look like a dhaba :P
4.0,"We went here on a Sunday evening and it was packed completely and waited 30 mins, I got to know that every restaurant in Whitefield gets crowded in the weekends. The food was good and was on the spicier side,please ensure that you inform the waiter to lessen the spice.   Price:3/5 Food:4/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Service :4/5"
3.5,"Very poor service, delay between delivery of items of what really pissed me off. Quality  starters all taste really very good. as for maincourse, I'd suggest to go for nonveg items & avoid rice items."
4.0,I had food here the first time I arrived in Bangalore but forgot the name hence never reviewed. My wife recently did a take away and the butter chicken was so flavourful and perfect hopefully will visit them shortly and give a more detailed review
5.0,Has a different ambience. Loved the fact that you can sit cross legged on a cot and eat. Ordered ghee phulkas which were soft with right amount of ghee. Had chicken lahori with it. Well cooked and had a good texture to it. Dal fry was brilliant so was the jeera pulav. Tandoori aloo was a little spicy. Finished the meal with a pair of gulab jamuns which did not disappoint either. I would wilfully go here again
4.0,"I really love this place. They offer some delicious variety of food. I tried many items and liked almost all of them. If you are a non vegetarian, you can chicken tikka and kalmi kabab, they were just awesome. In main course, do try chicken punjabi masala. The only bad thing is it is always crowded with loads of people. If you are planning to go on weekends, make a reservation otherwise it can ruin your night!"
3.5,This is one of the best dhabas in Bangalore that serve authentic Punjabi food. The ambience here is lovely. The dhaba provides both indoor and open terrace seeting arrangement with neatly laid out mooda stools and the charpai. It is usually packed in the weekends and as there is no reservation I would highly recommend coming here before 8pm to avoid the long wait. The food here is pretty good especially the kebabs. There is also a pan wala in case you are want to try different kinds of pan. So definitely check this place out next time you are in the neighborhood.
4.5,"Love the ambience. Very Dhaba-like. And the food is awesome. Absolutely no complaints. Just a suggestion if you go there, do end your meal with a refreshing tumbler of lassi"
4.0,"As i entered the place the look and feel was fully like a punjabi dhaba.. Also the staff was all dressed up in kurtas which i liked. There are teo sections for seating, indoor and outdoor. We opted for outdoor seating as the weather was pleasant. Coming to food, it tastes like home cooked food. We stuffed ourself full. Do not forget to try lassi. I will definitely recommend this place and would love to revisit."
5.0,"I came here few time,  the food is really great I like the sweet lassi in mud glass. Nice ambiance and comfortable sitting. Everytime I came here I had to wait for long to get table. But it's OK"
4.0,"Visited this place during weekend for dinner quite crowded and they dont book tables only first come first serve  Food Authentic North Indian food we tried malai panner tikka and tandoori gobi both good Main course diwani handi and pulav both excellent   Ambience grt if you get outdoor seating inside okish  Good value for money   Cons service not grt this is authentic North Indian restaurant however waiters push chinese starters Strange may be becoz of crowd and timing  Of all the 7 or 8 tandoori veg starters waiters say everything is spicy if want less or medium spicy they say go for manchurian ( crazy y will i go to North Indian restaurant to eat manchurian)   Management needs to train waiters on basic service and add more medium spicy starter option   Overall grt food so when you visit stick to North Indian even if they push, spice level for me was ok not too spicy even though they say spicy"
1.0,"Service is very poor. Food quality, quantity and taste is not that great. They served food everything at once starters, main course whatever i had ordered. That was annoying. Not value for Money. Rest rooms are not clean at all. Not good for families due to so many constraints. Bachelors may like the place and waste their money, its like mess."
3.0,"Food is good if you like more spicy food  we ordered kalmi kabab, malai paneer, harabhara kabab, Kadhai paneer, butter paneer and dal tadka.   Apart from malai paneer and bitter paneer kids cant enjoy any other dish.  Lassi is super delicious  must try item."
5.0,"One of the best in our area and hates off to your taste . I will recommend everybody around this area to try once and then decide. Unique Dhaba type themed restaurant and their taste of food is out of the world. Super delicacy and one of the most visited restaurant in the business.    Had there Paneer Hariyali Tikka, Veg seekh kebab, vegetable pulao, Chicken tikka were delecious. My regular visiting destination this one. Thank you."
5.0,"The best part about this place is its ambience. I love this place specially for the cot they provide, it reminds me of my summer vacation trips to my village. The food is also decent here. Gulab Jamun is really awesome, garlic naan needs a bit improvement but overall was a good experience and would love to visit them again :)"
4.0,"If you want to have good quality north indian food without burning a hole in your pocket, this place is a must try..we were lucky enough to get seats on a sunday night without having to wait..but you may not be so lucky..hence, be prepared!!  The place is a bit too congested. But the food will totally make up for it. The menu is pretty diverse and the service prompt. We tried a variety of veg and non veg dishes. Found the balance to be perfect for most of them.  Would love to go back again to try out other dishes."
4.0,The food was very delicious . The ambiance is also very good. Lassi was just mind-blowing. I frequently visit that area . The fulkas they give are very smooth..in short I like all the things on menu.
1.0,"I ordered, chicken Manchurian but they delivered gobi Manchurian at the cost of Chicken Manchurian. Beware! It was a home delivery order that I did yesterday."
4.5,"Shaandaar Taste ...The word 'YUM' comes to my mind when i had a bite of Chicken Lollipop...Simply Outstanding in terms of taste ,theme (Full desi Swag),ambiance. A bit on the higher side in terms price,but the taste overshadows it....Keep it up Guys (y)"
5.0,"I have heard a lot about this place but never had the chance to eat here.Finally on recommendation of my bestie ,we landed here after office. The place attracts good crowd-anyone who is a lover of North cuisine. We had to wait for 30 mins as my bestie wanted to have the dinner on the khatiya as in any dhaba. The decor is just like a dhaba , loved it with the lanterns lighting the place. We order kulcha - soft and stuffed, butter fulkas - generous spread of butter, kadai paneer and dum alu. Spicy yet tasty, authentic North food. To finish it off we had Chaach- refreshing. Good experience, must visit for anyone who loves North food."
4.5,"This restaurant is one of the best, serving delicious North Indian food at very reasonable price. Place is crowded most of the time and waiting time can be more than half an hour if you go on weekends after 8.30. So advisable to go early if you don't like waiting as there is not enough waiting space. Service is very prompt and food is delicious. We like their malai paneer tikka in starters and palak paneer/bhendi masala etc. All the paneer items are good. Overall very good restaurant for North Indian food"
3.5,"Nice Punjabi food. Chicken was good, paneer was not good! it was raw and not cooked properly. The restaurant didn't have soup!  Happening place otherwise."
4.5,We visited thia place on a Saturday. Crowded but after a 10min wait we were able to get a table. Service is prompt and good. Ambinece reminds you of a village in north india with their lanterns and khaats (cot). Food is delicious specially the sweet lassi in kulhad. Worth a visit.
4.0,"If talk about the ambience first, I like the ambience and setup. The sitting is much more like a dhaba with the cots and stuff where you can sit comfortably with your footwear off and have your meal.  Coming to food, it is good. You get all spicy food which is my first choice, taste is good. Service is good. Quality is good. Overall a good place to visit."
3.5,"The good was good and tasty. The lassi, kebab, curry, biriyani and phulka were good. I got a small screw in the curry, for which they apologized and offered a replacement. Will I go again? - Yes, since the food was good."
4.0,"Surprisingly good. The first time I visited this restaurant, I came away disappointed. But recently I've been here twice and I must say I liked the food. It is simple, uncomplicated, North Indian food. Suggestions are given by the staff, depending on preference.  I really liked the aloo kulcha and the dal tadka. The ambience is rather rustic and pleasant, too with charpoys and modhas. Can make for uncomfortable seating, especially on a full stomach, so make sure you wear your most comfortable clothes and seat yourself in a way to best enjoy the yummy food!"
3.0,"Went here after reading the reviews and hearing from people. Few things i would like to mention: food : taste is good but was not served hot. ambience : good. Authentic feel of dhaba. Service : the waiter serving us was very rude. Firstly, they asked us to order starters and main course in one shot. And even after ordering in one shot time gap between starters and main course was huge. For few ad hoc request, they gave a arrogant and rude response. Seemed to be in a lot of hurry. If you can ignore the negatives, its a sincere place to have food."
4.0,"If you are looking for North India food in desi style then you should explore this place. Dhaba styled theme restaurant with charpai. I would strongly recommend to try chicken curry and a glass of lassi here, it won't disappoint you. Overall good experience but you need to plan accordingly to get a table on time as there is long queue waiting to find one.   Food - 3.5/5 Service - 3/5 Ambiance - 3/5 Value for money - 3.5/5"
4.5,"A perfect place to hangout and eat some tasty North Indian food. Have been here multiple number of times and was never disappointed. Food - 5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Service - 4/5  Overall a must place to visit if want to have some tasty food and for north indians kadhai paneer, daal tadla , jeera rice and tawa roti  feels like home."
4.0,"Food is v good, service is fast. But ambiance is not comfortable, waiters will push to order fast and to release table fast. I hope no one is comfortable with this at food time.."
4.0,"Nice ambience, village theme, food is good....I liked mainly that they have put khat which is giving a complete difference experience. It gives you experience of complete raw village experience"
3.5,"Good veg food, though a bit costly. Generally this place is overcrowded, no phone /Web booking make you sit on stairs (while waiting)  Try rooftop.. Will find worth money."
3.0,I have been here once with my office colleagues for lunch. We had to wait for 10 mins to get the table. The seating arrangement is like a dhaba which justifies the name of the place. Quality and taste of food is average. Service is little slow. There is definitely a scope of improvement specially in terms of cleanliness.
1.0,"We were a group of 5, ordered a good amount of food but we found hair in ghee roti and a housefly in the water. And when addressed the manager said "" It's not there fault"". The response given was very rude."
1.0,Found a hair in phulka and housefly in water... When we went this issue to the manager.. He was stubborn enough... Saying it's not their fault .. Apart from food.. Service is also important..
4.5,My favorite place.. Chicken kheema and ghee phulkas are awesome!!! other dishes are yummy tooo..Love eating there everytime ... but always have to wait for atleast 30mins on weekends
3.5,Food - 8/10 Service - 7/10 Ambiance - 7/10 This place has tried to bring in the Ambience of a Dhaba in the middle of a Crowded city. It did succeed somewhat but the flavour of the food was lacking. The taste of all the curries I had was similar. The service was also late. The Lassi was good though. Hope you have a good experience. Bon Aptit
3.5,"Over hyped. Has food color added to stuffs. Tried veg handi, roti, JAL jeera, Good for hanging out with friends and family. Bit overpriced. Good ambience. Table service good."
3.0,"Good North Indian food, ambience is very good, food quality is good but bit high price. We had veg here food is decent. We have ordered Veg pulao, Mushroom Gravy and Paneer Tikka, Hariyali Kabab was very good."
4.0,"After waiting for 30 minutes, we got table for 6. Heard a lot about this restaurant in providing dhaba style food. We got khaat / khatiya(chaipai) to sit (which is amazing). Ambiance is great. As it was overcrowded, we got our food delivered little late. Taste was really good. And ended our dinner with Lassi (must try). Staff was quick and attentive."
4.5,Ghee Fhulka Chicken Reshmi Kabab & chicken kadai are my all time favourite. Already had there almost 5-7 times the same things & love it each time. Only concern is the waiting time. However a great food after a wait make you forget everything.
3.5,"Place for quick hangout with friends. Typical Punjabi food.The waiters are well mannered.  This place has a humble seating. We ordered Baby corn chilly, Mix veg curry, Dal Makhni with Butter kulcha & tandoori roti. Dal Makhni, was rich in butter and flavors. Baby corn chilly was delicious. Coming to mix veg curry, it was quite some good amount & decent in taste. The Breads were usual. Although the preparation had large oily coats yet delicious. Its really difficult to please me especially when it's Punjabi food. Too sentimental and emotional for all the dishes and their flavors and Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba didn't disappoint me.  Deserves one visit for sure !!"
3.5,"It is heartening to just visit such a place which reminds you of your backyard of your home. With farata fans and manjaas at the back, the place is well managed and the food was really good. Kulhad lassi is what I can think of right now. Achint Jain"
4.5,"After repeated recommendations, I decided to try out this restaurant with a friend. It surely lives upto the hype. We ordered garlic chicken and kalmi kebab in starter. Both the dishes tasted really good with the right balance of flavour and heat. In main course, we ordered butter stuffed kulcha and Handi chicken. The kulchas had a cheesy flavour which we both enjoyed and the stuffing was done right. The Handi chicken tasted just fine. In dessert we had sweet lassi. It was pretty thick and did a perfect ending to the lunch. The ambiance is dhaba like with cots for sitting. It's hygienic and a must try place for a foodie. The only downside is the amount of portion per dish. It's less given the price. But I would recommend going here coz the taste is worth the money spent."
3.5,"Had Tawa chicken from here. Though it is quite spicy , taste was great. Nice north Indian restaurant with good ambience. When I visited place was very crowded. I think always it is like that"
1.0,"We, a group of 9 visited the place for our sunday night dinner. The place is in our neighborhood and the ratings were also quite good, so we thought of giving it a try. But the place, management and most importantly ""the food"" really disappointed us. First we were made to wait for close to an hour and even after that, we were given a table for 5 only saying the nearby table will be free soon and the other 4 were asked to wait outside.Reluctantly and seeing the long queue, we took whatever table we got. Meanwhile they were pressing the people who were inside to order everything for all 9 of us in one go, even the rest of us were still waiting outside for a call. They were just interested in getting us out in least time possible, forget about making the guests comfortable. The staff was so rude to deal with when we confronted with the table issue. Now the most important thing about any restaurant is their food. That too dissapointed with low grade main course. Starters and the beverages were more or less fine only. But the main course gravy dishes were so spicy that it was very difficult to even eat. On top of this below par experience, we found so many small stone pieces in daal makhni. Again we called for the manager, but he cared least about the guests and tried to downplay the issue and later offered to replace the dishes. Although he apologized but we already had enough for one meal experience and decided to leave the place after paying the bill. It may be an one off experience but the way it was dealt with was so disappointing. I don't think we ever are coming back ."
1.0,Very bad staff and the food contained stones. The food was also very spicy. Such a bad restaurant. They are very rude and didn't even do anything when told that the food contains stones
4.0,"This place is perfect to have northern food (dhaba ka khana) Ambience is quite decent especially the seating arrangement gives you a feel of Dhaba We ordered Afghani kabab , seek kabab , chicken butter masala(butter chicken) chicken biryani and veg biryani and lassi it's a must  Overall Ambience 3/5 Food 4/5 Service 4/5"
3.5,The ambience is like a typical Punjabi dhaba with chaarpai and stuff. The food is as lovely as the place. I loved the reshmi kabab they served. The staff is polite. The place lights up in the night time. So it would be just the perfect evening you were hoping for if you visit this place for dinner.
4.5,If you are looking forward to eat some good north Indian food in AECS layout this is the place. The look is that of a dhaba as the name suggests. The food is simply amazing. Just that it's a closed place without ac but the rest was perfect.
4.0,"It's really been a long time that I tasted such delicious food in Bangalore. I have been waiting to try out this place since quite some time but every time I visit here, there will be a long queue and I had to go some other place to satisfy my hunger. Also, there is no option of reserving a table as they follow the first come first serve basis. Finally, I got a chance to enter into their premises on a rainy evening when there was no queue but still the place was full. Now, I was really piqued to find out what is so special about this dhaba cum restaurant setup. So without any further delay, me and my friends ordered their specialities - ginger chicken and kalmi kabab for starters. The food was served in no more than 15mins. As soon as I took a bite of the sizzling ginger chicken, I understood the reason for their popularity. I could feel the taste of ginger perfectly with every munch of the flesh; no less, no more. Kalmi kabab was equally flavorsome. For the main course, we ordered phulka, masala kulcha, butter chicken and one veg gravy. The food was served within 15-20mins and it was delightful. It would be a crime if I dare skip about the lassi. Seriously, that was one of the best lassi I had in a while. It felt like I am sitting somewhere in Delhi roadside dhaba and enjoying the drink. Also, they serve paan (betel)  right inside the restaurant which was quite good as well. Ambience was decent.They have given the restaurant a dhaba look with the punjabi cots to get the dhaba kind feel while you enjoy your food. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available. However, I was not very satisfied with the service. It was quite difficult to get the attention of the attendants to order anything or to make a request. They were so involved among themselves they did not care. The only reason I am going with a 4star rating instead of a 4.5 is because of the service otherwise I would love to visit this place again for sure."
4.5,Best place in Whitefield for pure Panjabi food. Advance booking not allowed only walk-in. Phulka roti is best for who wants health and wheat base.
4.0,"""Place that typically follows the 'desi style' not just not just in terms of interiors but also in the way they serve. Restaurant cum dhabha I must say!."
4.0,"Theme was good. We ordered Typical indian cuisine like butter roti, corn masala , baingan bharta , daal tadka, pulao ,paneer chilly and matka lassi. I was heard they serve nice baingan bharta over here but i don't find it was exceptional otherwise food were okay. Restaurant resides AECS layout with greate basment parking facilities. Prebooking in not avalabale for this restaurant , its just like first come first serve which kind of annoying to wait outside without waiting room, you got to stand or sit over stairs."
3.0,"As compared to my last 2 visits,this was not a pleasant one. The starters were good keeping the name high also the lassi was nice but i was very disappointed by the main course. The mushroom masala was not at all good and even the navaratna kurma's taste was not good."
2.0,The food is too spicy and oily. Even after requesting the staff not to make it too spicy they never accomodate the request. Very dissapointed with service
5.0,"Loved it..!! This review is writing for my third visit..!! Especially Nonveg items are too good..!! Just go for it, you will enjoy food for sure..!!"
4.0,"Great place for having North Indian Food. Ambiance is unique,gives you the feel of comfortability.The best thing ,they ask about how spicy your food should be. Service is okay. A Happening place. Food -4/5 Service -3.5/5 Ambiance -5/5"
1.0,"Overpriced, overrated, average quality food. The service is horrible. Went thrice, and we had to finish the dinner and vacate the table so fast as if we were occupying it without paying for it. They give you the bill even before you have finished the food."
3.5,Its a good north indian style food restaurant. Try to catch a khatiya while booking. Waiting time is usually very long on weekends. We have to wait for more than 30 mins for a group of six. Service is not as good compared to number of people they have to serve.  They take a lot of time to deliver food to your Table though Lassi is fast.  Must try Sweet Lassi here.  Most of the items in main course will not be available on rush days. You have to order from what is left. So try to visit early in the evening.
4.5,The food was amazing. Good quality and quantity. A bit spicy for people who are not used to Punjabi style food. Good place to hang out with friends.
3.0,"Went here on a weekend had a waiting time of 30mins. So we decided to go elsewhere,  'these hangry situations are not good' so we went elsewhere. We were quite intrigued by the long line that kind of piqued our interest. So went back another weekday.  The lassi was good. The food was like any normal north Indian restaurant so couldn't really understand the hype or the long lines. But of course the quality and taste were good.  I'd be at a ' maybe' if someone asked me to go here again.  Ambience was nice. Service was good too."
3.5,"The place is good for a quick hangout with friends.We went to have a farewell lunch for one pf our collegues.The foods was good,one prominent downside was that there was no air conditioning.The service could have been better and a little more thought should be given on hygiene."
4.0,Chulha chauki is one of the very few restaurants near Brookfield serving good north Indian food.  Quality of the food is awesome .  Must try : dal makhani  Food :4/5 Service :4.5/5 Ambience :4/5 VFM :3.5/5
4.0,"A special treat from my cousin when we visited them. Simple but food ambience. Good options of food which was very tasty too. Did enjoy the spice of India in papads, tikka, curries breads and flavored rice. Reasonable price and good service. Overall loved it."
4.0,"they serves a really good north indian food... had tried tandoori roti, chicken biriyani, chicken butter masala, lahori chicken, kadhai chicken..  chicken biriyani-- has 3pcs of chicken, good in taste... little spicy... quantity was enough for one,  chicken side dishes were up to the mark... but felt excessive garlic smell in kadhai chicken..  ambiance-- impressive  service--quite ok.."
3.5,"Absolutely one of the best places in AECS layout to have Punjabi or north Indian style food. I have visited this place once and also ordered for home delivery from the same. My first experience was great as  the dishes that I had here were top class and fantastic, suiting my taste and appetite. Mouthwatering Chicken tikka in starters and spicy delicious Chicken lahsunia along with roti and butter naan in main course. They have tried to give the place  a dhaba like ambience with khatiya and bamboo seats without armrest and glasstop tables. It remains usually crowded and you might have to wait to get a seat. The food is priced here almost equivalent to a fine dining restaurant so no surprises there.  In my second  experience I tried some veg food by ordering dal tadka, paneer tikka masala, aaloo jeera  and jeera rice. All dishes were fine except paneer tikka masala which was average in quality. May be they might not be giving much importance to home delivery customers because of the usual rush at the place. Hence I would recommend going there and eating instead of ordering. I lowered my rating because of my not so great second experience but I  look forward to visiting here again.  Food - 3.5/5 Ambience - 3.5/5 Service - 3.5/5"
1.0,"The place is just hyped up and little enpensive,food is not tasty and the spicies were raw in the food.We were asked to leave as in when we paid the bill"
4.5,Hidden Gem it was!!!!! It was 8 pm and I completely drenched in Rain was waiting near Brookfield for my friend..Inspite of Rains she insisted to walk almost 1 km to reach this place.. I was damn hungry and quite hopeful.. Now comes the ambiance..Total Punjabi dhaba style Restaurant..I loved it at the first look.. Food..Yummy Butter chicken masala..Fulka with ghee..Chicken Tikka and chilli chicken!!! Mind-blowing!!!! Big Glass of Lassi was the USP!! Sorry forgot to take pictures..But it's a worth the time place for proper Punjabi style Food!!!
4.5,"Ambience is nearly like a typical dhaba. I have always loved the food quality of this place especially the sweet lassi. Being a north indian, it's totally worth visiting. I have never declined going out to this place with anyone and will continue doing it since i am in love with the food and place.Do try out sweet lassi and never forget to have a sweet pan at the end."
3.0,"Prices of main course are on higher side as compared to the quality and quantity. Paneer Butter Masala was not at all meeting the expectation. Paneer tikka, Malai Kofta and Veg Fried rice were good. Roti's were also good."
4.5,Best place to have Punjabi food in Bangalore. Malai Kebabs and Tandoori chicken are must try dishes here. Always packed so better to reserve a table before visiting this place.
4.5,"Whaaaaat the food they serve... ummmmaaa   ..  Been there few days ago. Had    Veg. Seekh Kababs: It was the first time I was tasting this dish and I loved it..   Paneer Chilli: This one was a bit spicy otherwise tasted well. Buttermilk: Spiced buttermilk was a have one more glass, tastyyyy..!!  Butter Kulcha: This too was my first time, but it seemed same as tandoori roti to me except just some decorations over it. Palak Seekh Kababs: Again taste was super delicious but quantity served seemed less to me. Kadhai Paneer: This too was good in taste but less in quantity.  So they served amazing food, but don't expect large quantity to be served. The place remains crowdy most of the times and I was lucky for this as we went there on weekday and not on weekend days.  As its crowdy and place is very small compared to the people it is soooo chaotic so don't opt for this if you are finding a peaceful dinner place..."
4.0,"Went on a weekend and had an early dinner so managed to get a table for 3 easily. Otherwise this place is crowded and the waiting time is lot since they don't take reservations. Coming to food, we ordered masala papad to begin with which had lot of spices. The spices could have been reduced and it would be much more tastier. The Tandoori Chicken was juicy and absolutely delicious. Malai Paneer tikka had utterly delicious soft paneer. The Naan and Roti was fresh out of the oven. The kulhad lassi was out of the world. Couldn't stop with one but went on having two each!  Overall good food and good ambience."
3.5,"Small place. Upbeat ambience. Usually overcrowded with waiting time reaching 30-40 mins.   Serves good North Indian food, kababs and lassi. Biryani could be improved.   Great service!!"
4.0,"Nice ambience with lanterns, mudhas and khaats. A must go place for North Indians . Ordered hara bhara kebab which was nice. Gravies had good taste nothing out of the world but good and nicely served."
1.0,"Tasteless food. They have prepared a same kind of taste less gravy and add for any item you order. There is no difference between taawa chicken, kadai chicken, kadai paneer etc.. All tastes same. Poor quality. No smell of any punjabi masala. I request Zomato, please don't misguide people by giving rating 4*."
4.5,"Best northindian Dhaba in city. Food is very nice. Tried kadhai paneer , chicken starter, mushroom and baby corn dishes and ofcourse lassi.here lassi is like icing on the cake.Everything is best except service is little slow bcz of over crowded."
4.0,Only few restaurantin Banglore city to provide authentic with The place is crowded heavily and you might need wait for a while if you go with your friend but the wait is worth.Must try Twachicken.... Food-
4.5,"Great food, cool ambience, very Desi styled food joint. The chicken Tikka butter masala is so authentic that you can't have enough of it. The fresh lime sode is one of the best here. Overall, a superb Punjabi food experience at cost of surprisingly light pocket."
3.0,Have been a fan of the Chulha Chauki at Kalyannagar. This branch has similar offerings but lacks the vibes and energy. Tandoori Aloo & Paneer Biryani are must.  Food - 3.5/5 Ambience - 3/5 Service - 3/5
3.0,I have been here twice but ordered food online several times. 1) Its crowded most of time. 2) Food is good. 3) Cost reasonable. 4) Behavior of staff is average. You have to leave the restaurant immediately after completing your meal as they will keep on asking you to pay the bill.
3.0,Went there for the third time. Good quantity and decently priced. Authentic north indian food. Tandoori chicken was good but chicken malai tikka was not soft to the extent one would expect. Chicken Methi and chicken butter masala is really yummy though. Lime soda was good and Lassi is a must try. Lately their staff and service quality has gotten really bad. Few staffs lack basic manners. Our waiter literally threw fork and spoon in our plates. They really need to keep a check on that.
4.0,"The food was absolutely wonderful, good place to have north Indian food ,pocket friendly, but little crowded Ambience: 3.5/5 Food 4.5/5 Service: 4/5"
3.5,"Only for Delicious Food!!!  One of the few restaurants in city to provide authentic north indian dhaba style food. We ordered few veg and non veg dishes both were good. Harbhara kabab in veg starter but prefer panneer dish. Chicken Adraki was good. Don't order Masala Papad, it came with too much spices and bad onions. Chapati is better than tandoor roti. Service is good and well dressed staff (in kurtas).   Bad things: Food quantity is not at all enough. If hungry I guess one dish will be sufficient for only one peraon and the prices are 250+ per dish. Second thing is seating. They have khatiyas which is plus point but they tried to fit too many in small place. Sometimes you have to disturb people on other tables to move out. Third, place is always crowded so you have to wait a lot. Also they serve starters too early and make us wait for half hour after finishing starters for main course.   Overall: Worth a try for once for food quality. You won't get food quantity and table privacy. Avoid on weekends."
4.0,"Came across this place when we were exploring Brookefield area in our last stint at Bangalore. It has got a unique dhaba feel to it. Reminded me of Angeeti in Hyderabad during its heydays.  The food here is authentic North Indian / Punjabi. Rich creamy lassi/ chaas was exceptional. The tandoori chicken is a must try. It's well cooked, the masala evenly absorbed and succulently soft. This place stands out in the crowded food scene at Brookefield for its authenticity and commitment to quality.   Definitely a must try, but be prepared for the waiting time."
4.5,"The thing i like most about this place is authentic north indian food. It felt like i was sitting in my home and having dinner which my mom cooked. Absolutely delicious.  Place has a nice ambience and if you are lucky then you can also get the part which is under open sky...  Music was different, it was bollywood hindi songs, which is again gr8. The only thing i don't like is that the quantity of food was not appropriate according to the price, but then again it was delicious so no worries about that.  Will definitely go there again."
3.5,I have been to there branch in jp nagar and u would say the ambience is better here this is on roof top with khatiya to sit. though the taste of food is same. We had tandoori mushroom and veg manchurian in starters it was good but the quantity i felt was less.  In the main course we ordered mix veg and malai kofta. Malai kafta was not good it was too sweet and lassi was as usual good. The best thing was the sweet paan that was amazing.                                                                 foodtravelpedia.wordpress.com
3.5,"Really good place to hangout with friends ambience-dhaba style quite good.The place is always crowded so takes quite time to serve the order,but the ambience really makes you to get into the mood .Food tastes really good . The  place is crowded and table booking  not  available ,not a good choice if u want privacy"
4.0,"Food is really good. Service is very prompt. Ambience is a typical dhaba setup.  Only thing is it's very crowded always. Though you can expect this kind of environment in a place with all good things, but it's bad if u want some privacy   Do visit for some nice north Indian food."
3.5,Heard much Hype about this place ...Got a chance to visit here... In the entry i got to know whatever i heard was correct... I have to wait for 20 min to get a seat here. On my first view when i entered here i feel like a street dhaba on road side... It is the modernized version. They placed thing very beautifully. Small lantern are light all the way in dining area.we are placed on a Bed for eating.we ordered food.. they took lil more time to serve. The food we tasted was not so good as i heard. First Lemon chicken .it was extra spicy.Then Lehsuni chicken was lil bit sweet.The Garlic nan was very hard to tear even we have opted for butter.The biriyani was okey type.But the best part was Handi chicken & Lassi. The Handi chicken gravy was too good as it should be. After our food the Lassi took our heart away.very awesome in Taste...  I recommend this restaurant .if you are in a group .must visit once.
5.0,After shifting here I was missing chulha chauki(Jp Nagar) But yeah  Relief Chulha chauki is here Near to main road Great food Great ambience Great staff Nice place to hangout Kudos
3.5,"I had been hearing about this place since I came to Bangalore. All my friends said it's a must visit place. So had a lot of expectations from it.  The ambiance is quite nice and everything has been used keeping local village culture in mind.From the small lanterns on the entry to the sitting arrangements with khats (jute bed) n chauki, staff wearing kurtas everything gives you the feeling that you have entered a typical village of India.  Coming to the food we ordered kadai paneer,aloo gobhi and boondi raita with ghee fhulkas.Being a North Indian the taste of the food to me was preety average, nothing was a delicacy to the mouth. But the sweet lassi was great something which made up for rest of the meal.  Service was the one thing which really disappointed me.You ask the staff anything and the answers will be blunt and uncompromising.They don't even offer to serve food in the plates.  If you are a lover of North Indian food you can give this place a try but don't keep your expectations too high."
3.0,We had to wait for half an hour to get seats. Just another hotel with same taste. Extreme of everything in tastes. They started forgetting the quality to serve people quickly.  Food-3 Ambience-3.5 Service-4 Value for money-3
4.5,My go to place for good north Indian food. Amazing menu with a good variety for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. Great service!! As expected it is always crowded. Expect a waiting times of updo one hour on weekends after about 8:00 PM
4.5,Good restaurant......... Nice nice nice nice ambiance Good good good food Service also good Price is average Ambiance 4.7/5 Food.        4.8/5 Service.   4/5
5.0,"If you want an authentic north Indian restaurant, this is the one to go to. I go here almost every Sunday.  Heads up , there is waiting time here mostly. Though there service is extremely fast so you won't have to wait more than 10-15mins.  Food -5/5 Ambience -5/5 Service - 5/5  Must try their lassi (I prefer the salt one) and Kadhai mushroom.   Well to be perfectly honestly none of the dishes here ever disappointed me.   Keep up the good work!"
4.0,Visited this place thrice with my friends. Seating style and ambiance is good. Crowded on weekends. Well managed in limited space. Service is good. Food is tasty. Good for people who like spicy food. Must visit this place.
4.5,"Why you should go? The most paisa vasool north indian restaurant you gonna find in bangalore... Period  YEAHH.. -Despite pocket friendly they don't skimp on food quality.It's as close you can get to dhaba flavors from the north in here at bangalore. -Butter chicken -Malai kebab  NAAH.. -Ambience is not that great, but who cares. -Terrible seatings,no backrests. -Vegetarian food is lacklustre(as told by vegetarians).   VERDICT- If you are in a mood to hog plain north indian food, visit this place and you won't be disappointed.Plan to be in long waiting queue.But just go already   AMBIANCE-3/5 FOOD-5/5 VALUE FOR MONEY -6/5(This has to be the first on my list)"
1.0,One of the worst staff behavior experience ever! Khana khila rahe ho and that too i pay for; ehasaan nai kar rahe!!! Would expect someone from their management to call and discuss with respect to this! Apology my foot! PS: i dont give such harsh reviews until treated like it!
4.5,"Food was just awesome , spicy and theme of normal common place is good. I liked place and food. Don't forget to have lassi after your spicy order."
4.0,"Punjabi food and chulha chauki are the best combination. Every visit we make, i enjoy the food here. Palak kofta, chicken tikka and paneer chilli are my favorite"
1.0,"This rating is for the very impolite and uncourteous service given by this place time and again!  Yesterday was my third visit and I was visiting there for my farewell dinner with office group. A group of 5-6 including me reached the earliest hence we asked them to assemble the table for 15 members. After they assembled,we came inside and I asked my friends to take a seat,right then a man looking like the supervisor of the place asks us to sit outside until all 15 members arrive. I was baffled! I said they are reaching any moment now,how can u ask your guests to sit outside.. especially after you have already put our table together. He was extremely unprofessional, rude and loud. Started screaming this is our policy,we don't block table this that. I told him ok I'll talk to your management,he comes back saying dhamki kisko de Rahin Hain.   Other people started arriving,or I would have left this place.  This is absolutely unacceptable and I would warn other customers and would like this to reach the ear of the management. Disgraceful!"
3.0,"Had to wait 30 mins on a weekday to get in. Seeing the queue we hoped that the food would live up to the expectations. The seating is rustic with a dhaba feel to it, but if you sit for long hours it becomes uncomfortable. The restaurant is downright noisy, just the way a dhaba is supposed to be! Not the ideal place for a candlelight dinner. The waiters are good and service is above average. Now the most important part, the food! Food is average and expect nothing fancy from it. We ordered Malai Paneer Tikka, Masala Papad and Lemon Soda in starters, all of which were simply average. For Main Course we ordered Phulkas (served chapatis instead) and Malai Kofta (too sweet for my liking). The only good part was the Lassi that I had to round off things. So its a classic case of ""Uchi Dukaan Phika Pakwaan"" which is literally true because the restaurant is at the 4th floor :P . All in all its a one time visit because the food is average, the ambiance is rustic and the dishes are moderately priced."
3.5,"Went there on a Sunday evening. It was packed place with waiting. The service however is very good. Ambience is very nice with open, semi open and closed options available on the rooftop. The food was also nice. Tried their CCDD special tikka , hara bhara kabab , dal makhni, veg kolhapuri. Dal makhni could have been better rest was all fine. The portions of starters served was very good."
1.0,Horrible service. They say their minimum order for home delivery is 700! Not professional in the way they speak to their customers.                                    Not sure if i want to go there or order food from there again.
3.5,"Nice decor, love the set up.. and service.. food is average didn't find the reviews justifying the food... Yes the place can be rated good in comparison to the eat out places around AECS LAYOUT but can always improvise bcos the competition is heating up"
5.0,Great ambiance  Authentic dhaba food.  Lovely and fast service.  Loved sweet lassi served a earthen glass.  Best ever dhaba food   Overall awesome...
2.0,"I placed a order of chicken lusania and tandoori chicken and garlic naan. The chicken lusania was way too oily and spicy. It was all about masala and no taste . Thetandoori chicken was okaish, but it takes really effort to spoil a tandoori chicken.  The naan was uncooked and there hardly any trace of garlic in it . Even after i called the restaurant to explain bad quality of food he was least interested .   Best to avoid this place"
5.0,First of all a very desi ambiance with muddaa and manji. Lassi served in earthen pots has a special smell. I am vegetarian but they have nice phulkas and paneer dishes like paneer kadhai and baigan ka bharta. Must visit
3.5,I come here only to have lassi . Lassi is awesome . It tastes like a thick ice cream . Woooaaah  Chicken items are OK to fill stomach after long office hours
4.0,This gem of a restaurant in marathahalli aecs layout is a really crowd puller. We visited on a rainy stormy weekday night and it was super crowded. The food is delectable and very tasty. We had an opportunity to enjoy the rain in the out doors location on the roof top where we got some spray of rain. Would like to revisit again.
4.5,Good food with nice ambiance. Grt choice for weekends. Try the panner tikka. It was the best. Can ignore the rush by prior bookings. Nice experience.
5.0,"I was extremely excited to taste the food in this dhaba. I visited this place with 5 of my friends. We ordered Butter naans, chicken starters,mushroom biryani and Chicken biryani. Every single dish overthere is scrummy. We ended up with a glass of lassi. Do pay a visit if you are a North indian food fanatic."
4.5,"Stopped by at this place during a shopping spree. . For a quick dinner. Had heard a good review  about this place from my husband. So to begin with its in aecs layout. A very north indian kind of a place. Not too much over the top decor. You get to sit at the khats and woven chair. It's gives a nice feel. May be if you have old people you may wanna check about the low seats. But the food man... Food is very good. Lip smacking north indian dhaba kind of food. Very quick service.  Waiters are at your service very quickly. A very hearty kulhad lassi to start giving you kulhad ka making taste in your mouth.. Very earthy and so was there chaas. Then we ordered mushroom tikka fresh out of tandoor served with kachumbar salad and fried chilli's., a very nice take on mushroom they weren't overly cooked. For the main course we ordered paneer butter masala the paneer was very soft in a nice tangy tomato based gravy... Nothing extraordinary....desi ghee wali Dhaba ki daal was amazing.. With the smokiness of tadka and lots of ghee.. Was very satisfying. .. The desi ghee wali tandoori roti was very nice..  Very filling. Everything with the fried chilli and onion rings made our meal very satisfying..  For all the food we had for 2 people we paid less than 1000 bucks. .  Good deal for the yummy  food."
1.0,"Veryyyy bad staff response for delivery. They don't deliver on time n when cald regarding the delivery they respond in jus a single word ""Sorry "" after waiting for soo long and say that they don't have enough staff to deliver. Mat b it must a small order for them, but they jus don't care about the hunger of their customers n refuse to deliver inspite of requesting. Jus not even bothered about the zomato reviews or response of customer."
4.0,"Nice food, decent price, Service is good. I liked Malai kofta with white gravy, this was the best malai kofta i had till now in Bangalore. Panneer gravy was also good here. Nice place to go and have food."
3.5,I had planned my dinner here as this looks like a best destination in Brookefield.  The place is crowded heavily and you might need wait for a while if you go with your gang but the wait is worth.  Ambience - It doesn't has any funky Punjabi ambience that you might expect but has a decent bamboo finish with a retro style kitchen 4/5  Service - Nothing much to talk about but could have been better if they choose correct utensils and cutlery. 4.5/5  Food: CCDD special tikka and believe me you can add it on your must have list (5/5)  Missi roti is well cooked and it's great. (5/5)  Methi roti as the name suggests it's a roti we thought that it would be made out of wheat flour but it was made of maida. Taste wise it's good (4/5)  Now comes the villain dish the Tawa Veg curry which was worst. You don't feel it like a gravy and the vegetables are not cooked properly and not chopped properly (3/5)  Lassi and Butter milk shouldn't be missed (5/5)  Had a Tanda pan in the pan point near the exit and better don't give a try.
3.5,The interior of the hotel looks completely like a typical dhaba.The place is quiet small..we need to wait for min 5 to 10min....coming to the food...it gives authentic Punjabi taste..the starters tastes good both in veg and non veg...than the biryani..
4.5,"It was my second time yesterday. Awesome food. We ordered chicken garlic, lemon chicken and baby corn Manchurian dry as starters. Lemon chicken and chicken garlic were very very tasty, enjoyed eating every bite of it. Ordered Biriyani and it was finger licking. The oil content was bit more in all the dishes. Then we ordered kulhad lassi and butter milk. The lassi was one of the best lassi I have had so far. I would definitely go here again. It is usually very crowded and I recommend going there early to book a table."
1.0,The service is very pathetic. The staff is so arrogant that I cant explain. Would not suggest anyone to go there especially on weekends. They don't care if the customer is happy or not.
4.0,"We have to wait for almost half an hour to get a table there. The ambiance was good. We had both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, compared to non-vegetarian vegetarian dishes were good. The quality of food is nice and quantity is reasonable."
4.5,Food - 5 (best for non-vegetarians) Ambience - 5 Service -4 Beverages - 4.5 (lassi )  Everything at its best just the service is a bit slow and that maybe because of the heavy crowd.
3.5,"The place is a hot place for families as well as friends. The place is full almost always and one has to wait for at least 15-20 mins. And the wait is bittersweet. It's bittersweet because the food is good, but the service is not quick. It may happen that you would have to wait another half an hour at least. The food makes up for it. If the service would have been prompt I would have given a higher rating."
1.5,"Very substandard restaurant at a very popular neighbourhood. If you are foodie ,  avoid this place.  We went there on for Sunday afternoon with family and friends.. Ordered biryani, tandoori, lassi, roti, chicken and veg starter.... With the given price tag.. I feel, if you cook biryani watching YouTube you may cook better. We try different types of roti, wondering why roti was so dry and rubber like feeling. Only item i like was Chicken tandoori and lassi.. The place is highly congested, because of space and sitting arrangements."
4.0,Good food here ordered lemon chicken  and love it when we are here . The long wait time is okay as it's worth to wait for and the service is great . I have tried to eat so many times here only  overall it's okay .
4.0,One of my favourite punjabi restaurants in Brookefield. Can't miss Lassi from this place. Good ambience. Can enjoy food with your gang in a typical punjabi dhaba style.
2.5,"DeliciousFood with worst service. You have to wait for the main course minimum 30 mins. You have asked every 10 mins for food, then maybe they deliver food in 30 mins.  Please improve your service."
4.0,One of the few saving graces in the area. It can however get a bit stuffy and hot if you're planning on lunch as its not air conditioned. Loved the chicken makkanwala and would definitely recommend the babycorn Manchurian for starters.
5.0,"This place is so good . Food taste is awesome especially pulka, paneer Manchurian and gulab jamun. We have tried only veg items and it was awesome"
4.0,"The place is a bit unnoticeable until and unless you're familiar with the restaurant or the area. It is on the top floor of the building, basically a roof top restaurant. But once you enter the place, you'll not feel like seating in some posh restaurant rather it is a proper 'dhaba'. They have open area seating arrangements in   'khatiya'. Also covered area is there. But the feel will be like a roadside dhaba, this is something I like pretty much about this place. I've been to this place quite a few times. The average waiting time is around 15mins because its mostly crowded. But service is fast and good. So you don't need to wait much as long as you manage to get a seat. I have tried many dishes here but the best will be Malai paneer and Malai chicken kebab. Chicken lasuni & kalmi kebab also O liked. In the main course I like daal makhani and chicken lahori. Last but not the least lassi and paan. Now you'll feel like you had a complete meal and in your budget (I will categorize it as pocket friendly restaurant). Overall this is a good quality proper Punjabi restaurant. You'll like it if you like Punjabi foods."
4.0,"Very good food at reasonable price. All the starters are good, lassi is awesome. Only issue is waiting time. Its too crowded on weekends and you may have wait long for your turn, so better visit early."
4.0,The interior is much restored as a Dhaba. Scores a double check for the seating . Personal favorite is the outside seating area . Always visited on lunch hours in weekdays and its crowded throughout. You may have to wait for a while to get a place. Regarding food is 9/10 and have variety and rich in non-indian flavors.
4.0,"A bit late for the review, but this place as always been my favourite for North Indian food in Bangalore.  For starters we ordered Tandoori aloo which were very yummy. For main course we went for dal takda and biryani which are my all time favourite over here. And yes , do not forget to order lassi or jaljeera, these are the best here."
4.0,"I have visited this place multiple times on multiple occasions. The interior resembles a dhaba and the waiters also wear a kurta to give yiu the complete feel. The open roof area can give you more authentic feel of a dhabha. The service is great and the food is served quickly despite the fact that it is too crowded at most times.  I had tasted almost everything at this place and nothing will disapoint you ever. No matter what you order, you should get a Kullad lassi for sure. The best is the Kalmi Kabab that is served here. Ghee phulkas are the best one can get in bangalore. The menu is huge and one cannot be bored easily from their even if they visit hundred times. The only thing that can be irritating at most times is the waiting time to get a table. It doesnt matter if you are going on a weekend or weekday, going on during lunch hours or dinner time, you'll have to wait for atleast 30 mins. The trick to get a table is to go a bit early to the standard hours.  Overview:- Food:- 5 Service:- 5 Value for money:- 5 Ambience:- 5"
4.5,"I am yet to see a proper dhaba but this place, I believe can be a good start. Wicker chairs and cots, open roof, oil lanterns, copper jugs, steel plates and also pebbles in a corner. Good efforts have been put to present it as a dhaba. The chicken on the menu is delicious. I love the Reshmi kabab that comes wrappen in omelette. And the best part is it is very budget friendly."
4.0,"Love love love this place, have lost count of the no of times I have been here .. Everything on the menu is delicious , haven't had a bad dish till date, and the must try here is their rich lassi and their hara bhara kabab, the kababs melt in ur mouth and love the munt chutney he gives ... The prices are pretty reasonable too..."
5.0,The ambiance is definitely like a dhaba.. The food is great!! I can eat here every weekend and also during weekends the place is insanely crowded... I love coming here with friends and chatting over hot yummy food...
4.0,I went this restaurant and the food was very good and tasty and delicious..... Ambience was good..... Only the serving took a lot of time..... I had to wait a lot time.......it is a very good Punjabi Dhaba.....
4.0,Interiors resemble a dhaba based in Punjab. Full marks for setting up such an atmosphere.It is heavily crowded in weekends and you will have to wait to get a table. We loved the chicken makhanwaka and the bhindi masala with naan. The lassi was great too.
4.5,"Wow.. that is exactly the word that comes to your mind when you have food at this place.  My friend had taken me there saying its worth trying it out. Their Chicken tandoori is lip smacking, tender and super soft,  We ordered half plate chicken tandoori, chicken punjabi masala and naan.. everything was wonderful in taste and the quantity justified their price.  The lassi in the end was the icing on the cake.  It was heavenly. Thick consistent and smooth.  You must be there early for food as you might need to wait for 15-20 mins to get your place. This place has great food and thats why there is a huge rush at this place on any evening  The seating arrangement is very much desi and i found that distinctly attractive.  Must visit for a food lover..  Thanks for the great experience."
4.0,How much ever I try to describe d food here it goes wste bcoz I cnt exactly. D food is too yummmmmmmm n it never disappoints whatever u pick up from d menu..Tried almost everything in veg n trust me it's delicious . Only drawback is u will have to manage wid fans ..Dnt expct acs ! Even d waiters provide a good n quick service ! 4/5 - only for d food
2.5,"Definitely an overrated place.  The entrance is dark with no natural/artifical lighting and no air circulation. But it  can be considered for family outings as it is themed as a Desi Dhaba style. Can expect a waiting time of around 30 mins on a busy weekend.   We ordered Lassi, CCDD Special Tikka, Aloo Chili,Tandoori Chicken, Malai Kofta, Kadai Chicken, Naan. Had to wait for about 45 mins for the main course to arrive after starters, which was a major turn down for us.   For main course I felt that the Kofta in Malai Kofta was uncooked , tasted bland and not soft as other usual Malai Kofta.  Other than the lassi, nothing was up to the mark. They really need to work on their service and quality of the food.   I will never recommend this place to any one else."
3.5,"No Parata , no egg items except boiled egg, chilli egg , feelings disappointed . v came for parata, ordered pulka, tandoori roti . overall good , if items are not there , should remove or should inform before ."
4.5,"Amazing amazing food here, people who stay near by are lucky that they have this place. The ambiance is great and the place always crowded. Great food."
3.5,"I had ordered food before from here. Today decided to drop in with friends. The food was good , both the vegetarian and non vegetarian items that we ordered. The kullar lassi was to die for. It took us 90 minutes for the food to come. The waiting time was killing. Not sure if this because of the rush ( Saturday afternoon), but 90 minutes is really not good. Loved the ambience. Some Punjabi music would have been nice instead of FM music."
4.0,"Best restaurant in a low budget. I used to visit there when I came Bangalore for the first time and since then I have been visiting there frequently, mostly for team lunch or dinner. Food is good in taste. Also the ambience is nice as they give a feeling of a north indian village. In a low budget range, this is one of the few good restaurants in kundalahalli.  Food- 4.5 Ambience-3.5"
3.5,"There are little things about this restaurant which makes a huge difference.  The Dhaba setup is surely a hit but the place gets very crowded and you will feel the heat as there is no ventilation. The lighting is too dim considering its just a restaurant and not a pub. Coming to the food, it's very delicious and almost gives you the authentic punjabi taste.  The kalmi kebab, sawariya chicken, Tandoori chicken, butter kulchas, dal makhani , different types of chicken curries, Ghee in hot phulkas with veg curries everything was good, spicy though..Spicy food lovers will like the taste..Sweet Lassi was at its best.. Price wise it's average. Not too costly.. Overall nice place to have dinner with family.."
4.5,"Been visiting here from almost the time they had newly opened this place.Its like a Food outlet next door. You have a wide range of food options to choose from. The ambience is good. And the charpai sitting arrangements certainly catch attention. I was a bit uncomfortable to sit on that to have food though. The food here is awesome be it Paneer Tikka , lollypop chicken Manchurian style(My personal favourite) to bhindi masala, dal tadka, chicken sawariya...Etc etc and u name it.. the lime soda sweet n salt to lassi. And to top it finally the Paan. Great place to take family and friends. It's a overly crowded place most of the time. Have visited their BTM Layout and Kalyan Nagar branch as well. And all serve the same taste and good quality food.."
4.0,We tried the chicken kalmi kabab which was succulent and tasty. We also tried the tandoori chicken which was decent. Chicken Angara is a must have for people who want spicy food. It's a nice place to eat at. It is generally crowded so make sure to plan for the waiting time. Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Decor: 4/5
5.0,Me and my friends when craving north Indian food this is where we end up!! The place is done up so nicely and also the food is beyond delicious. Their veg and non-veg dishes are equally yummy... Highly recommended.
4.0,Mostly order home from here. Always delivered hot and at the committed time though this might vary based on demand. Accepted card payments for door delivery which is a great thing. Good food.
5.0,This is a really popular place in Brookfield.. The food is truly delicious.. Both veg and non-veg dishes are great.. Also the place is so so cute.. Highly recommended..
4.5,"Ambience - 4.5/5 Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Enjoyed Chulha Chauki dinner. Overall a must try place. Went with couple of families.... had a waiting time of 15 mts on a Thursday evening 8:00 pm..... since it was a big group. Order on the table was Mushroom chilli, Chicken lollipop,  paneer tikka, butter chicken,  paneer butter masala,  diwani ki handi, aloo gobi and assorted breads. Diwani ki Hundi and Paneer tikka was the pick of the lot for me. Paneer butter masala was good as well...right mix of tanginess and creamy. Chicken lollipop. ..I was told was very spicy. Overall food is in the spicier side. So remember to tell to make is medium IF you are not the spice lover kinds. Butter naan and rotis were good. Garlic naan was bit tough. Choice of desserts ....rather availability was limited. Only Gulab Jamun was available. Verdict - Must try."
3.5,"A renowned place in Whitefield for good North Indian cuisine. This place is crowded most of the times. During weekends it is almost impossible to get a table without being on the waiting list. But it is worth the wait. Try the kababs here. Hariyali Kabab is my favourite, succulent pieces of chicken spiced rightly. Among the veg starters, paneer chilly and babycorn manchurian are delicious. Phulkas are soft and Rotis are good too. Egg Kalimirchi, Ghee rice were decent enough. Chicken Angara is amazing, it has an authentic flavour of the spices and it was super spicy. Jeera rice and Dal fry tasted superb. The Lassi and buttermilk are to die for. Jaljeera was just above average. Service is a bit slow, could be because of the heavy rush. Lovely ambiance, a little noisy sometimes, good & courteous staff. Priced reasonably for the quality of food that they serve. I hope the person who takes orders for home delivery and take away becomes polite and little more attentive to what the customer says."
4.5,One of the best food and more into north Indian and Punjabi flavor . Price is bit costly if I see others . But food is awesome .keep going same .
1.0,"This is a highly strange place. If I were to be this slow (like their service) in bed, my wife would be the happiest person on earth. The attitude of their waiter is like they are our Hitler fathers and compelling us to eat whatever is thrown into our plates. Any item which is requested twice in their Kingdom is misunderstood as a shouting and we should be prepared to face their wrath. I would personally not recommend any living soul to visit this place if you have even a shred of self respect to spare. On tte  tte with the manager, the domineering attitude was war mongering but anyhow I controlled myself and left the premises without wasting my time on those shallow human beings."
4.5,Best Punjabi food in town.. very pocket friendly and the food satisfies you like no other Punjabi place in town.. malai paneer tikka is a must try.. even the kullhar lassi..
5.0,This place gives you a real feel of dhaba.. The place is always buzzing with people and the food is lip smacking goood... Their veg items are really yummy. I love coming here on weekends..
4.5,"Good to the taste buds and better for the pocket. A must visit place if you are around. Better reach by 730 if on a weekend, else you'll wait forever to get a table."
3.5,The ambiance has that rustic touch . We ordered mushroom tikka which was wonderful and machuran for starters. For main course we had dal makhni which was sweet and paneer tikka as told by the waiter to b spicy but wasn't spicy at all. Buttermilk is the good part.
3.5,"Dhaba style food and ambiance. There was a long waiting for about half an hour for us, hinting at how popular the place is. Service was slow on the day, very likely just because of all the people they served. Food was dhaba style but okay in taste, I've eaten better food elsewhere. Decent place to go to at least of you don't want to travel all the way to Indiranagar or beyond."
4.5,"The place has a lovely rooftop seating, though they have a very old 80s 90s song collection.. it was amusing enough for us to sing along to some bare minimum lyrics we knew. The food was really spot on! For any person who loves north Indian cuisine this place would shine out. Some people did find the gravy pretty spicy, but it depends on personal spice intake levels. I personally loved the CCD special chicken, which was really tender. Do visit guys this place guys! :)"
1.0,"Horrible experience ! We went for a team dinner for 14 people and as soon  as half of the team was done eating the manager asked them to get up and move to another table. When given a feedback to improve his behaviour with customers he mentioned ""I'll talk the way I want"".  The service thereafter was rude and the staff kept muttering things while serving. We even told him that he is an employee representing the hotel and he has no right to be downright rude to customers, he stated that he feeds 600 people in a day and doesn't care about the feedback from one table. The food is amazing but a restaurant can't have managers who feel entitled to treat people like commodities. Thumbs down if you are planning more than a meal !! Hospitality here is outlived soon after the food gets over."
1.0,My emotions varied from indifference at the beginning to infuriation at the end. In short: Uncomfortable seating. Long wait. Abysmal service.  Average food at the price of all of the above.
1.0,"The service is slow, the staff changes orders at their whims and wishes. They also force you to order things that will be easy for them to serve. I like the ambience but the staff is arrogant, the guy who handles the seating acts like a mafia. I will find it difficult to recommend anyone to go here."
1.0,"I decided to visit here because of high ratings, but place definitely seems to be very overated. The food and servings were not up to the mark. Chicken was very hard, I doubt if the served food was fresh and hygienic. Not recommended!"
3.5,"I have been to this place more than thrice, and every time I have loved it. The first time i was here was with my team, and the food tasted really well that day. Since then, they have lost their taste. The ambiance could be a bit more better. It feels crowded at times. the seating arrangement is to be blamed for that. The music is always playing, but u can barely hear it, as they keep the volume quit low.  In my multiple visits,  I have tasted almost everything they have to offer. They have a lot in their menu, and they do justice to it so full marks for that.  I would recommend a lot of things, like afghani kabab, veg chili balls, stuffed mushrooms they are lovely, the jaljeera drink is really refreshing. For main course, do order malai kofta, and dal makhni, something i love at every punjabi restro. The tandori roti are at times so soft n just at its best. but in my last 2 visits, the qauality and taste of the bread has degraded. The last but not the least, THE PAN. I always take more than 3 pan's at once, cz they are goooodddd ;)  The service is also good, however they take almost 25 - 30 minutes for the order to come. I understand, in order to get good taste everything they prepare is fresh, but they can do few things to decrease the time. Spcly when ppl have to wait for almost an hour just to get a table.  Its not so heavily priced, and looking at the taste of food, i would say its worth the money.  All over, do visit here once, if you have a craving for proper Punjabi food."
4.0,It's good for a impromptu dinner where you get Punjabi veg and non veg food. Food is delicious and I could tell from the crowd waiting outside.. seating is casual but goes with the theme.. overall good place in the neighborhood for Punjabi food..
3.5,"Been here couple of times. The ambience is dhaba sort of which is different from other dinnings. Usually the place is crowded specially on weekends. The chicken served here is good with Punjabi flavours, spicy and tender. Lassi was average here. The Pan served here is a must try. Dont forget to have it. It is absolutely must thing to finish your food with. Not at all pricey. Only the seating arrangement is bit that needs to be modified. Pay a visit !"
4.5,Food was good. Must have a lassi here along with the food. Little spicy. But those like spicy will like this place. Ambience is also good .  Service was OK OK.
4.0,Had to wait for almost one hour to get a table. However the wait was fruitful. Had ordered butter chicken and it was yum. Possibly one of the best in Bangalore. And yes Lassi is a must!!
4.0,"So I went to this place today for lunch .. Waiting was there but thankfully we dint have to wait that long.. This place offers a good ambience, nothing grand .. They give you the true feeling of dhaba with the ""muddas and khaat"". Food was quiet good ... The quality of food is good .... But the service isn't fast at all .. We had to wait for 15-20 mins between starters and main course. Kulhad lassi is a must try if you visit. I will definitely go again and take my friends tooo ."
4.5,Amazing place. Delicious food. Kulhad Sweet Lassi is a must try. One of the best lassis I have had so far. Would rate 5 if their service was a little faster. Great ambience. Panneer was amazing. Would definitely go again.
4.0,"Folks! If u luv 2 eat tasty food, u must visit once. Ambience=3.5/5 Food=4/5 Service=2/5 Value for money=4/5 The service is bad, staff is unprofessional and rude. But, once you taste the food u'll luv it.Almost all the dishes taste yummy."
4.0,Food - 4/5 Ambience- 4/5 Service- 4/5  Food is really good and authentic dhaba style. If you're missing north Indian dhaba food then Chula Chauki Dhaba is the answer for all your craving  Restaurant staff is very active and they appreciate instructions for personalized food experience.
4.0,Great theme. Great ambiance. Good quality food. Lovely. Try the outside area.
4.0,"I don't want to eat vegetarian food outside. But i would love to eat vegetarian food here. These people serve best vegetarian food. I order the obvious vegetarian choices Gobi, Mushroom and Baby corn. These people added magic in these dishes, they tasted really well.  I would have given 5/5, if they could have served lassi without any flavor. It is a must visit if you like vegetarian food."
1.0,"Dine-in during lunch time is good....been there few times.Take-out foodat dinner time has so much red/green chilly that it is inedible.Tried different menu items from chicken tikka to dum aloo to currys..all had excess chilly problems. Wonder if others also hadsimilar problems.Experienced it 3-4 times - each time same problem - even over a span of several months apart. Perhaps their take-out chef team like excess chilly. Gave feedback to the restaurant but they don't seem to care. Once ordered with less chilly, still didn't make any difference....toomuch chillyin the food with eyes watering...can't eat. Don't think we will go there again. Too bad, their dine-inlunch food is milder and good though."
4.5,Great experience... A traditional Indian food with traditional arrangements which really make u feel that u r in your home town. Food n service both r excellent even u get more desi touch n taste in all food. My only advice is if u planning to visit this restaurant on Sunday plz make previous booking other wise no one knows u get table or not. I had to wait for more than one hour even there were more than 25 customers waiting for their turn so imagine the popularity of the restaurant. Cheers guys will back soooon..
1.0,Service is horrible and they keep on asking you about bill while you are eating and ask you leave even if no one is waiting. Their argument is they are not charging service charge and say that it is not a place to talk it is a place to eat and leave. All the best to those who visit this place.
1.0,"Had the worst experience while dining at #Chulhachauki #dhabha  near brokefield mall, whitefield.  1. We were 5 people ordered food for 1600.  2. The worst service by arrogant  goons as if they were giving the food for free. 3. We ordered 12 thanthoori rotti a but they Delivered only 10 but  billed for 12. 4. The starters and main course were served together reasoning the closing time busyness. 5. The bill got delivered before we complete the food and asked us to leave immediately after payment as more customers were waiting. 6. Once we realised that there were no customers waiting and most of the tables were empty, and once we questioned, the goons told that this place is meant only for dining but no talking. 7. As usual the food quality was very poor.   #neverecommend. #worstfood."
3.5,"Ambience - 4/5 Taste - 4/5 Value for money - 3.5/5 Must try : Tandoori chicken, Lime soda salt Suggestion: Name board to be put up with a bright light. Since it is in the 3rd floor, I hardly noticed it even though I've been near this place many times."
4.0,"Great dhaba style ambience and good north Indian food. Taste is amazing. Reasonable cost. I have been here multiple times, tried different things and result is the same everytime, delicious.  If you are going on a weekend, be prepared to wait from 15 - 45 mins. But it definitely is worth the wait :)"
4.0,The atmosphere and the ambience is extremely good. Very good place to visit for dinner. The food was extremely good. A special mention to Malai Kofta. It was excellent. Must Visit place.
5.0,"Hello hungry lil monsters,   I went to Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba today for lunch and treated myself with so much food!  This plate has an ambience of that of a Dhaba and the food is yummy!   I relished Hot Garlic Chicken, Kalmi Kabab, spicy Angara Curry,  a basket of Naan, a tall glass of lassi and finished with meeta paan!   This place is usually crowded, thanks to the delicious food. A must try if you want good spicy food!   ~Yours hungrily"
4.0,"One of my favourite Punjabi restaurants in Bangalore.This was my Third visit to this place and everytime it's been a amazing experience.If you have to visit this place during weekends then waiting time is around 30 min so be patient but wait is worth it.This time we tried Jaljeera(everytime we ordered the same as we love it),Paneer Tikka(good one),Kadai Mushrooms,Missi Roti and Aloo Kulcha(it was yummm)."
4.0,"My first visit to this branch and being a great fan of their JPNagar outlet, I came away rather happy with the food.  Tandoori Gobi - my favorite dish from their other outlet was completely destroyed here with tons of red chilly. Too hot even for my visiting family who are from Rayalaseema, the land of super hot food.  Mushroom Chilly - nicely balanced taste.  Paneer Chatpata - not bad, just a little too many bits of almost raw garlic.  Phulkas and Naans - no chance of complaints here!  Palak Paneer - good but a rather large dollop of cream made it too sweet.  Dal Tadka - the Best dish of the lot. We literally licked the bowl empty. Perfectly cooked dal with just the right amount of perfectly tempered Tadka.  Baby corn Biryani - decent.  Kulhad Lassi - good.  Update - Visit 3: Kalmi kebab: Succulent. Egg Chilly: Rightly spicy. Methi Malai Paneer: Lightly sweet, awesome flavor. Capsicum masala: Spicy, must try. Gulab Jamun: Ok.  Staff courtesy has improved from my previous visits. So has the service. Parking still remains a challenge though."
3.5,"A nice and cosy place, on the roof top. Situated on the arcs main road, parking is a big issue. The decor is nice,and the food, mainly north indian cusine are good overall. They are a chain and some how the one at Kammanahalli has better tasting food. Try Thier Chas, it's really good."
3.0,"Had been here for a team lunch. The ambience as promised is a typical Dhaba style setup. Food served was normal but the quantity was good. It had the flavours of Indian cuisine imbibed , with generous amount of butter . Lassi was excellent. The food was worth the price paid."
4.0,This place provides perfect North Indian food . Food quality deserves 4.5. Just the place is little congested otherwise it's a good place food wise .
3.5,"Had heard a lot about this place and decided to try it out on a fine Saturday with my friends. Ok, so to start off with, you can't reserve tables on call and upon reaching there, we had to wait for 45 minutes to get a table. The food, although good, doesn't quite lives up to the hype. It's quite decent north Indian food, but nothing extraordinary. Yes, the ambience is good with the interiors reminding you of a typical north Indian Dhaba. The Lassi, although, was delightful and one mustn't miss Lassi here. Overall a decent place with a little too much hype!"
4.5,"Nice food. Good ambience. Can do little better on ORDER-Serving time. ""Lassi"" is OK, but not 100% lassi. Please make it better. Overall satifcation - 4/5 and recomendable for Casual Dinner with family and Friends."
4.5,"Awesome n awesome.. Very good food. Tried the items all are very good a try.  Recommendation : Mushroom tikka, masala kulcha,paneer items. Ambience : Awesome Service : Very good  Taste : Awesome   Must visit place for punjab related food.. In this area. Would love to visit again n again"
3.0,2nd attempt. After 40 mins on the wait list on a Sunday evening got our hot seats to warm our bellies. Seating was fine. Place was swarming with chattering crowd and an equally vocal service staff. Nothing unexpected of a dhaba. Our order was taken by one delivered by another and billed by yet another. Cool.    Our expectations had reached its peak. 40 mins. Packed audience. Busy staff. Buzzing kitchen. And a few hungry bellies. Now climax.  Tandoori chicken was nice and tasty. Kulcha and lahsooni chicken followed fast. Chicken was raw in parts. Gravy wasn't much better either. Kulcha was ok. Lassi was the clear winner. I nodded while the senior staff explained the raw and rubbery chicken. Well my bad.  Can't explain the craze of this dhaba. Non existent service. Long wait. Average food. May be we had a bad day. Sayonara.
4.0,"Having been to their other 2 outlets, wanted to try this one as well. And just like the other ones, this too was a pleasant experience.   Chicken Hot Garlic was good, but too spicy for my liking. The Egg Manchurian has to be their signature dish... brilliant as always. The Egg Punjabi Masala was very ordinary. It tasted just ok with the Fulka. Kulhad Sweet Lassi was lassi served in an earthern cup... it was very good. Lime soda they serve here is too good.  Pricing is quite decent. No extra taxes or charges whatsoever. Service and ambiance are fully upto the mark. This has now become my favorite Punjabi restaurant chain in Bangalore."
4.5,"Let me start off by saying, I am not usually a fan of North Indian food so a 4.5 rating from me, means this place is something else!  My husband dropped by and reserved a table for 5 beforehand as he wanted outdoor seating. Tip: Wear comfortable pants and chappals when you go- they have the traditional cots on which you can prop your legs up and sit. Keep in mind that the chairs do not have back support.  The ambience calls for 5/5- it's done up in very good taste reflecting the authentic Punjabi food. Service was slow but it didn't seem to matter much. The food though! 5/5!!!!!  My overall rating has dropped half a point only because of the slow service.  I would surely visit again!"
5.0,"I have been here twice. Even my dad liked the food and the seating arrangement. :PGreat ambiance. Great food.Make sure that you reach there by 12:30, else you have to wait for a long time, because it's always crowded. That makes sense, because they serve amazing food!"
4.5,"Been here once.  Went here last afternoon for lunch. We went early thinking it would be easy to get a place,  being a weekday.  Boy,  were  we wrong!  The place was packed and people were happily eating kababs  and drinking lassi. But we were seated immediately.  Ambience is great!  With low seating and such,  it has a very authentic dhaba feel to it.  Coming to the food,  we had the Lasuniya kabab.  Very,  very,  good!  Must try for everyone who loves a strong garlic flavour! Main course we had butter naans and chicken Punjabi Masala which was suggested by the staff.  Very good suggestion,  as we wanted something spicy.  One naan has three pieces,  instead of the usual two pieces in other places. Loved the food!  Wait staff is helpful and kind.  Very reasonably priced!  Lunch for the two of us came up to Rs.694!! Must visit  and everyone told us we should have tried their lassi, so going back soon to do that!  Happy munching!!!"
4.0,"Went for dinner here tonight. Even on a weekday the place was full with people. Firstly the ambience is great, they have a complete dhaba set up and its rooftop so a plus point. Coming to food we ordered tawa roti ,Afghani chicken, masala papad and buttermilk. Afghani chicken was superb and i would recommend it to those who dont like much spicy food. Service was good and prompt. And they have great value for money as well. Would definitely like to visit again :)"
4.0,"I had been here with my colleagues for team lunch. The food was good. The ambience was also good. Had to wait for sometime after the starter for the food to arrive , as there was a lot of rush. Tried both paneer and chicken gravies and they were good."
3.0,"A typical dhaba style restaurant. Went for a friend's promotion treat. I am a vegetarian so ordered malai paneer tikka for starters, the flavour was good but the paneer was so haaaaard. I couldn't eat after 2 pieces. Then for main course I ordered garlic butter naan and paneer tikka gravy. Also jeera rice . The flavour is good here. One must try is Kulhad lassi. That's worth trying."
4.5,Loved the seating area. Just like a dhaba. Amazing food. Chicken lasuniya and chicken punjabi with garlic butter naan a must have. Worth the money. We sat outside and the feeling of having food open air was good.
4.0,Considerably huge place yet totally full. The seating is good. The food is amazing so authentic and tasty.  It is on the rooftop so the ambiance is even better.
4.0,Chicken lahsunia and garlic butter naan!! One heck of a combination on a cold winter night. Interesting about ambience is that how elegantly they have made  a set up out of normal dhaba things. Worth visiting. Don't forget to grab a glass of lassi!!
3.5,"I am a new bee to Bangalore and have hardly tried restaurants here.When asked where to dine out, i used to hear about Chula chauki from some of my folks. I never preferred as I always felt dhaba toh dhaba hota h, nakli dhaba mein nai khaana. This Sunday evening when my friend got me to this place, I couldn't believe my eyes on seeing the queue. People were literally waiting for their number and I opted to see whats the deal with the queue and stayed back . We got our number after an hour , but the wait was worth it. The ambiance is totally comforting. It is not like a complete dhaba dhaba but it is something where you can hangout with your best buddies and eat dabake. The service is a bit slow but never mind ,it gives you more time with your friends.  Speaking about food, we ate all vegetarian starters which were good to eat. Veg seekh kabab and veg manchurian is what you can opt for because when asked they say they are good at everything. Being a roof top place, the cold breeze in this winter extends space in your stomach. Its a must try if you want to eat a lot and if u donot eat a lot, u may start eating !!! Got to try non vegetarian dishes next time. I am coming soon !!!!"
3.5,"I would give my opinion of the following Dhaba with respect to various aspects ranging from the Ambiance to the food we ordered to the service provided by the Dhaba.  1. Ambiance - I would definitely give it a thumbs up for the unique traditional set up which is quite rare to see in a metropolitan city like Bangalore ,however on the contrary i found the small traditional stools to be quite discomforting to sit on to since i am a tall person. 2. Food - The starters were mouth watering and delicious . I had ordered Paneer Tikka (Veg) & Chilli Chicken(Non Veg) along with my colleagues and finished it instantly. Next for the main course we had ordered various kinds of breads (Garlic naan, Butter naan , Aloo stuffed naan etc.) along with Curries ( Butter Chicken and Chicken Hyderabadi) .Main course was great as well except i did not like the Butter Chicken. 3.Service - The service was average which in my view should be the one main thing which the Dhaba needs to look upon . We had to wait for quite a while before the food had arrived on the table.  Overall , I would recommend people to go to such place for its Unique Ambiance along with the Delicious Food !!"
4.0,"Had veg food from this establishment. Loved the food. Good ambience, we had low lighting, I loved it. The service was good, but there was a rush of people and felt that it affected the service. Will definitely recommend to my friends"
4.5,The reason I'm rating this place 4.5 is because of the home style food I had there.. The roti and buttermilk was totally awesome.. Ambience and service is also good.. Beware - there will be long queue on weekends
4.0,Starters always start with baby corn chilli and Hara bhara kabab in here along with papad. Gobi tava fry is optional to taste if you can have gobi in any form. Diwani handi with pulka will be yum. Paneer butter masala is must try here
4.0,Great food . This has become a daily go to .This is around AECS Brookfield area .  Best restaurant in the area by miles. Actual dhaba style food .
3.0,"The ambience is good. But food is just average. Food was too spicy that we couldn't even finish. Starter was good, try their Dal that's good"
3.5,Food and ambiance was preety good. Quick service and pocket friendly price. I only found that all menus are not available. Apart from that all is good.  Love to visit again!!
4.0,"Good food - veg and non veg. We ordered tandoori chicken, veg kholapuri, matar palak malai (sorry if the name is not in order ), sweet lassi, buttermilk, dal tadka and lots of rotis. Food was really yummy, but our entire waiting time from table reservation to food arrival took about 1 and hf hr waiting time. Such is the rush here. Nice place to hangout with friends."
4.5,"A must visit for all foodie.. ultimate dhaba feeling with ultimate food.. feela like i am having a realy dhabe ka khana.. my mouth is watering.. ambience superb, food damn delicious very pocket frndly.. must visit for all.."
1.0,the waiting place is horrible. no way to reserve a seat. horrible people at reception. not at all comfortable seatings. had waited 15 mins standing. food is good . but if u have alergic to food  pls avoid this place.
4.5,Good ambience. Authentic Dhaba feel. Lip smacking starters and tasty main course. One of the very best of the places I have been to recently. The staff is polite and helpful and the prices are surprisingly lower for the quality of the food. Don't miss the lassi here.
4.5,Have been here many times. Ideal place for north indian dinner. Food is awesome. Excellent ambience.  Sweet lassi after a heavy dinner makes a perfect combo.
4.0,"At last, I am writing for one of my favorite hangout places in Bangalore, I am a regular visitor at CCDD as i love the simplicity of the place. I have been here for team lunches as well as casual dinings. The dhaba style Khatiyas along with Truck-type songs makes one feel as if you are on a highway, specially at night! Pretty simple, pocket friendly , tasty food is what you can have here. Although not much options to choose from , but still from the dishes I would recommend Dewani Handi - semi gravy mixture of different veggies as must try. This is one place which has never disappointed me although I would suggest them to include more varieties and expand on space, as you have huge fan list , the place becomes congested at times. Nevertheless , Way to go guys :)"
5.0,"One of the best places to eat in Bengaluru.  Delicious vegetarian food, quick service and cool staff.  Don't go for ambience.  This place is to eat and leave and rightly so.  Go for an early dinner or lunch on weekends.  I love the Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Paneer Tikka.  I have been eating here for last 3 years and the taste and quality is still amazing..........."
3.5,"Well it's not the first time I visited this place, but to be frank all the times got the same pleasant hospitality and marvelous north  Indian foods taste. The garlic chicken as starter make you more hunger for main course. I love to eat butter naan with methi chicken here. Only the problem is with seating arrangement. It's not very comfortable for having lunch or dinner."
5.0,"This is our go to place. Soft phulkas, tasty sabzis and super satisfying lassi! What's not to like? Try to avoid visiting this place on weekends though, too crowded and long waiting time."
3.5,"Ordered food from here to work one day and wouldn't say that I was disappointed.  All the starters  and main course were good, especially the chicken ones. The can improve on the milk based dishes like malai kofta, afgani chicken (curd marination) and make it less sweet.  Overall, good quantity and moderately priced and definitely won't burn a hole in the pocket."
4.0,Taste 5/5 Service 5/5 Price 4/4 Very fast services. No pre table booking option. Fist come first serve. A lot of options for veg and Non veg
3.5,"""Once a place is famous it looses its charm""  I experienced the same after my third visit I felt I should write a review.  Food is definitely good & tasty but u won't get everything everytime something will be missing and you be asked to decide faster.  Don't know why but the waiters are always in hurry.  I don't think any Dhaba in the world will be in hurry to let there customer's go without making sure if they are satisfied with food and service"
5.0,This is the only good place for food around this area for both veg & non-veg. - I stay walkable distance to JP Nagar Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba and ambience is same even here at the rooftop. - Friday afternoons are little annoying due to waiting time. - Service is pretty quick n decent. - Lassi is at it's best (don't forget to try) - Ambience is different and good.
2.0,The food was decent but the service was terrible. I had a really bad experience at this place. I hope the service is a little more polite and professional.
2.0,"Food was good, but the service was pathetic, specially the manager was so rude as if he is doing charity and not providing any service. I would advice others to order food online instead of going there."
3.5,This place gives you the feel of rustic ambience.Furniture made up of Bamboo and cots gives you the vibes of a village.Lanterns also add to the beauty of the rustic atmosphere.Food acts as the icing on the cake.We went for the farewell treat given by our seniors there.There is a huge variety of non veg and veg cuisines.I liked the chicken tikka masala which was spicy enough to enhance its taste.The lassi served is delicious.The service is okay.
3.5,1. Very crowded.  2. Slow Service.  3. They will just bring the food and you have to do the honors of serving it on your plates.  4. Taste : 3.5/5 5. Ambience : 3.5/5 6. Cost/ Rate : 3.5/5 7. They follow first come first serve methodology.  8. You can Enjoy time with your friends and family. They might undergo dhaba experience amidst the chaos.
4.0,This is one of those north indian joints that offer spicy food. All the dishes I tried were really good and mouth watering. The place is crowded most of the time and had to wait for at least 20 mins but it's worth it.
4.0,If you are planning to go here on weekends then be ready to wait atleast for half and hour or more. It has a wide variety of Punjabi North Indian dishes. Staff and service is also good and they can adjust spices according to you as well. Overall it is a good place to have good and delicious food.
4.0,"Nice ambience, punjabi style.. famous dhaba sitting, with old lalten lights, with open rooftop. Fast service, ultimate place to taste smoky punjabi flavours"
4.0,Yummy North Indian food. Perfect combination of flavours. Even the normal dal fry is delicious. Ambience is good. The staff is also courteous.
4.0,Quite good place with Punjabi theme.Service is quite good.If ever been to there don't skip the lassi.Apart from that the food is not best still good+.best place for everyone.
3.5,Chulha Chauki is one of those places which will never disappoints you! Good place with awesome Ambience and Mainly for people eho crave for good North Indian Food One of the few restaurants in and Around Aecs Layout which serves authentic north India Food Not happy with the service
2.0,Think number of times if you are here to collect a parcel. The place is way over crowded than its capacity. The attitude of the staff is even worse. They don't care after you order. Food is good by taste and that is the sole reason that Keeps the place going.
4.0,"Chulha Chawki Da Dhaba (CCDD). This place is not new to me and writing this review after being here multiple times and in all the 3 outlets. Definately, a favorite for non-vegetarians with good vegetarian choices also. Why I emphasize on Non-veg is the difference you get in similar places and CCDD especially in non-veg. It's cooked perfectly, tender and juicy chicken which is pleasure to your taste buds and mouth. I would also advise to stick more to starters (tandoori - for both veg and non-veg) than main course for Chicken Lovers. Sawariya Chicken is good for people looking for spicy tandoori. Rest, try what you like and hope you will not be disappointed. Cheers!!!"
4.0,Great parathas & salad and ambience. Good service also. Need to add more options to the drinks section like thandai etc and also reduce the wait time.
4.5,"Awesome food, easy on the pocket is what would describe this place. 4 of us had gone on an all Non-veg lunch and we came out happy after the experience that we had. Special mention goes to Methi Chicken which was one of the best that I have had. The Tandori Chicken was well marinated and perfectly cooked. Chicken Kadai was nice. One must try their Lassi, Butter Milk which again was excellent.  The staff is friendly and cater to the taste of their guests. Ambience is ok - we were sitting outside under the umbrella. Since it was a bit windy, the umbrella kept falling all the time."
3.5,"Comfort North Indian food in Bangalore is how I would best describe this rooftop restaurant. Loved the ambience...squatted right on the ""Charpaayi"" and enjoyed a nice meal. We had Tandoori Chicken and Kadhai Chicken. The latter was sumptuously spicy, just how I personally like it. The place is in great demand and boasts of a huge waiting list. However, they only take reservations in person...so plan accordingly :)"
5.0,One line... this place never disappoints   Been here numerous times and left every time with a feeling of satisfaction. Be it the dhaba ambience Or it's  Amazing food  Or  the professional staff which dnt look like a professional but behaves in much more professional manner then you can expect  All in all my favourite place in bangalore to have North Indian and mughalai food
5.0,"An absolute delight for foodies. Pocket friendly. Must try-Diwani handi,kulhad Lassi, gulab jamoon. Have visited the place thrice and the experience is amazing."
4.0,"It is pure & authentic north indian desi style DHABA with pleasant ambience. It serves North indian food which has yummy taste. Quality food with desi touch in a desi ambience, value for money. Food quantity 4/5 Serving quantity 4/5 Service 3.5/5 Value for money 5/5"
4.5,Been to this place last night with my family - parents - consort and kido   Was infact surprised to see a huge waiting time to get a table   But given the fact that there are not many such good dining options around brookfield this places scores high on two things - desi style dhabha ambiance - paried with good north indian fare to taste !  The best part we have 3 restaurants below them - Amaravathi / kayal and Jade chinese - apart from jade rest all stand back when it comes to competition - reasons quick service - tasty food and desi dhabha style ambiance :)  So they said 20 mins fr getting a table for 5 of us - seen close to 50 people waiting outside -   so we too decided fr our turn  (BOOK A TABLE IN ADVANCE TO AVOID WAIT TIME )  Once we were called by the manager to get our seat - we requested him to give us the cots (CHARPAI) with 2 wooden planks in between where our food is placed and served for us..  I was quiet happy by the response of the manager as he quickly found one CHARPAI for our family and gave it to us - (even though the place was quiet jam packed he was considerate enough and cared for our request)  When it comes to ambiance - it has the proper Dhabha style ambiance - dim lights - one side they have 3 to 4 CHARPAI's laid out with open air seating - that gives the true feeling of dining out on a highway DHABHA :) :)   After a long time i got a chance to dine along with my kid and consort sitting across a CHARPAI - with a plank in between - and our parents were seated across the plank  I had seen many families frequenting this place with their parents too :)  BUT ONE THING THEIR SEATING ARRANGEMENTS MIGHT BE NOT OK FOR ALL - who love to dine in FINE DINE PLACES AND PAMPERED Its rustic and desi style  dhaba style place   They were kinda uncomfortable with the seating - but as time passed by the music and food made up their mood and they too loved the place and ambiance -  Ambiance - 4.5/5  I loved their rustic - DESI Dhabha style - with dim lights open air - CHAK DE PHATEE !!  The muzic they play is again good - 80's and 90's old hindi classics :)  adds a unique charm to the place :)  Food - we choose to have Veg sheekh kabab and Veg manchuria dry   was doubtful on the veg manchurian as i felt its a wrong choice to order one in a dhabha   but they proved me wrong - and the veg manchurian was perfect - tasted yumm and was superbbb  and then comes the show stealer in starters - veg sheekh kabab - its so soft succulent and tasty and was heavenly with right amount of spices added and cooked so well - and was served with mint chutney - !!  we all loved the starters that we finished them in just about 2 mins :P  then coming to main course - we choose to order their veg kofta curry and their paneer tikka curry   The veg kofta curry was slightly on the spicy level - compared to the normal malai kofta curry - but tasted really good   Then comes the paneer tikka curry - which was indeed yumm the gravy was so thick - it had the richness of tomatoes and fried onions made as gravy -   we ordered stuffed kulchas and the phulkas with desi ghee  The phulkas were indeed soft and perfect and then comes the kulcha it was stuffed with onions alu pyaaz topped with sesame seeds and coriander - perfect i would say !  Then come the veg biryani - which was again great cooked and tossed well with fine veggies like the french beans / carrots / potatoes / paneer fried and tossed in light masala / with fried onions as a topping again !  Food - 4.5/5 (their curries - subzis steal the show paired with phulkas )  coming to the service - they were quick polite and humble -  we asked fr few dishes and they suggested us the level of spicy ness and they customized the food and  taste as per our liking :)  Then we asked fr onions and salad - they got it in no time -   they cleared the plates on time and served things too with care and were infact quick - no matter it was crowded to the core !  Service - 4.5/5  VFM - 4.5/5   The bill came up to 1200 fr all of us - which is a steal deal - reason they have only service tax of 6%  No othre dumb arse taxes - like vat of food - service charge - service tax - additional tax n all  The prices are quite reasonable -  If one loves to try out their veg and non veg fare with a tinch of DESI North indian Dhabha style do give this place a try for sure :)  Dil khush hogaya :)   Will come back for sure with my family again and with friends to try out their non veg fare !                                             krantiawelltravelledgourmand.wordpress.com
1.0,2.7 kms away from my home and they asked for a minimum order size of rs 800!!! Which restaurant has minimum order of 800?? This is after they have delivered earlier to my place many times for much lesser quantities. And they were rude enough to say that it's ok if we never order from their restaurant again. Sure have lost a regular customer. All the best!!!
3.5,"Been there thrice, first experience in jayanagar was great.juicy kabab and yummy kofta curry. But brook field one was just ok. Kabab is always tasty but too salty..briyani wasn't good.."
4.0,"We were looking for a good place to have butter chicken with tandoori roti and we reached here. The waiting for a table was almost half an hr but the wait was worth it. The butter chicken tasted good. We even ordered lehsuni chicken which didn't taste as good as the butter chicken but I won't say it was bad, it was different. I got what I wanted so I would surely recommend it for the butter chicken hunger pangs. :)"
3.0,"Punjabi style food .This restaurant has got a big hype . Food is average . Difficult to get table if you have not booked it . We have ordered missi roti ,tandoor chicken , malai kabab .. All taste the same . In Nonveg option only chicken is available. Most of the curries taste same . Dal makhani taste not that grt . So overall not much satisfied with food ."
1.0,"Unfortunately, the home delivery services were very poor. We ordered Schezwan fried rice three times from this place and every time they sent veg fried rice. When we called them to replace it, they simply told that you can pay less and take this order. It looks the like management is very unprofessional and they do not care for the customer's preference.   I will never order from this place again."
4.5,True punjabi taste with traditional ambience. Damn crowded. It is really difficult to get a table on weekends as the queue is two floors long....so on weekends if you reach by 9...you might not get a table at all. Weekdays mostly 30mins waiting. I visited this place thrice in 3 consecutive weeks. The CCDD special paneer n chicken both are amazing.  The traditional cots give the place a Punjabi touch. Also slow nice old Bollywood music playing sets the mood right. The staff is friendly and service is quick. I don't like Pan but my friends said it's quite nice. So do visit but make sure to reach before 9.
4.0,"Ambience: 3.5/5 Service : 4/5 Food : 4/5  Nice service and food. I went with my family and we all liked the place. I had baby corn manchurian, hara bhara kabab, tawa veg, chicken lasuni. Manchurian was slight spicy and rest were nice."
5.0,Best place fr punjabi food !specailly the ambience it reminds me of punjab ...punjabi traditional ......... Loved to be hea ...........!!!!!
4.0,"It's quite a long time for the outlet being opened. Still the great north indian taste and quality is maintained. If you r going here, keep a minimum half an hour waiting time to get the table. However the food is worth the wait, even better."
3.5,"Visited this place on a Saturday afternoon. The place was crowded. The food was good , ordered aloo dum and phulka ,but may be my expectation was more. The ambience is good. But honestly the seating was not that comfortable for me. No matter what, if the seating is comfortable the food is more enjoyable. Their lassi was just me be blowing. I loved it.."
4.0,Very nice place.Pocket friendly.It is a roof-top restaurant.They sitting is dhaba stlye khats which is nice addition to roof-top. Food is good and as i said earlier it is pocket friendly.Place is crowded most of the times so recommend to reserve a table. My suggestion is try it on a weekday.
4.0,Expect long waiting time if going around 8:30 - 9:30 p.m. The staff also looks in a hurry to serve you so as to let other customers in. starters and main course arrived at the same time for us. The food is very delicious. A good family restaurant.
4.0,"Good food,Nice concept.This is the place which is always full.So expected waiting time will always 30mins.We ordered chicken starters and chicken handi,veg handi and dal makhni,everything aas good in taste."
3.5,"Visited this place on a Sunday evening, had heard alot of this from my friends. There was lot of waiting to get a place to sit, we had to wait for around 40-45minutes. The ambience is decent, though only a  small portion is open roof top, while the place where we sat was kind of suffocating. There was nt enough ventilation. Coming to food, we had paneer chatpata and chilli aloo in starters. Both were very tasty, little over spicy but good to kick off your 45 minutes long hunger. Then, we had methi mutter malai, paneer kadhai and veg kolhapuri. I personally liked methi mutter malai, because of the sweet taste. One can go of the other two, if you like that spicy masala vegetable. I had fulka and tandoori roti. Finally, we had lassi but I dint like it much. It was more of elaichi flavour. But I did found, the quantity comparatively very less.Overall, a nice experience maybe next time will try non-veg food dishes.  Food - 3.5/5 Service - 3/5 Ambience- 2.5/5 Value for money- 3/5"
4.5,The ambience here is exactly like any dhaba you find and its beautiful in the evenings. The food is yummy and you will love it if u like punjabi food. I have tried chicken tandoori and kasturi kebabs and it was delicious. The main course items like chicken lasuni or chicken punjabi masala were yummilicious too. The service is quick and reasonablw rates. I loved this place.
4.0,"Very good food. Chicken Tandoori was as expected. Paratha was good. Makfhanwala,Kadai mushroom were tasty. Lussi was just amazing. Service was not up to the mark but waiters were friendly & smiling. one thing, i was totally uncomfortable with cane furniture. ambiance is ok. totally food was good. enjoyed."
3.0,starters were good but not the main course.
3.0,"Food is 4/5 Service is 2/5, some ppl went after waiting 45mins for order to hit the table. Ambience is 3/5 small place, during rains its worst, the seats are very low and uncomfortable. Price is 3.5/5 ok for the taste. Overall 3/5 - I wouldn't recommend a friend."
4.5,Best place for north Indian food. The ambience is perfect. Friendly staff. Affordable price. I love this place. Do try lassi and dal fry... Yummmmm...
4.5,The passage way to this restaurant is sort of cramped and its on the top floor. It offers both outdoor and indoor seating options. Loads of natural light and that is a plus! Coming to the main aspect the food was mouth watering and delicious. True Punjabi style tadka lunch with lassi!!
3.5,"A bunch of us colleagues were looking for a place close by and happened to stumble on this restaurant. The ambience was pretty decent. We were lucky to get a table as soon as we walked in. While the place definitely stands out with it cane furniture, its a challenge for vertically inclined people. Our order of missi ke roti, kulchas, paneer tikka masala, navrathna korma, chicken kebbab and aloo gobi masala came soon enough....as did the lassi. What took close to 40 mins to be placed on the table was the chicken biryani. As an only rice eater, waiting that long while watching everyone else eating kinda gets to you.  The bill wasn't astronomical as one would expect, considering 6 of us were at the table and had consumed that much....but the place is rather pocket friendly. Again....it it were not for the wait, I'd have rated this place a lil higher."
4.0,"North Indian food lovers, this place is for you. I like the way they have made the seating arrangement. It really makes you feel as if you are enjoying your food in dhaba. We had ordered some chicken starters, butter chicken along with paneer stuffed kulcha. Taste wise the food is just awesome."
4.0,"Good food...had masala papad, gobi chili, veg kolhapuri, mutter paneer and rotis along with lassi and buttermilk. Very filling and tasty food with nice ambience. Must visit place."
4.0,I have been here twice and both for birthday parties. Food is really good but on weekends its crowded so it's better to book a table prior. Price is little bit on higher side but still manageable. On a crowded day you have to wait for a long time but they don't have enough seating arrangements for the same. Technology has to be incorporated instead of pen paper to book a table.
4.0,"I am visiting this place for a long time, and it never disappointed me. The ambiance is superb and food taste is just amazing. Their look and placement, gives you a proper feel of a dhaba, with equally delicious cusines. everything I tried here was amazing but, the must try items are : Chilly chicken lollipop manchurian, panner chiili, Lemon chicken, ccdd mashroom tikka.  I give 4 star rating, and suggest you to visit atleast once,to taste amazing dhabha food."
4.0,"We decided to try this restaurant based on Zomato ratings and we were's dissappointed. The ambiance is great, especially the open air section, giving it a typical dhaba style feeling. We started with a full-plate for Kalmi Kabab. It has a great taste of the marinade and the meat was juicy with a charred taste to it. Our next order was Butter Chicken - which was cooked to perfection. The proportions was generous and had the sweet, buttery taste to the curry. On a downside, the garlic naan could have been better. It was dry and crispy - seemed like the naan wasn't cooked fresh to order.  One great thing to note about this place that is DOES NOT charge service tax or VAT. Something that is rare these since almost 30% of restaurant bills is made of all kinds of taxes."
4.0,"Located on the topmost floor of the building, it had waiting line till the road! Now, you can imagine the demand of this restaurant. Though it was crowded, the service was smooth and swift. Talking about food, I can say it serves the best Punjabi food among all the restaurants I have visited in Bangalore. Though some dishes were too spicy like Chilli Potato, but the taste was damn good! A lively and village themed restaurant. Service was excellent. Serves a variety of veg and non-veg dishes. No pre booking. A must visit."
4.0,"Its been almost 2 weeks that I visited this restaurant, hence I dont remember what I had ordered. But, simply saying, the restaurant is a heaven for North Indian food lovers. This place is a good contender for the famous Punjab Rasoi restaurant.   Great taste, exulting ambience, swift service and economic pricing has placed this restaurant on the top of my chart.  Weekends, this place really gets crowded and reach here early to grab the seats."
1.0,"Had gone there for a friend's treat as a team of 10 people. While the food was good the service was pathetic to say the least. At the outset when we started ordering some 4-5 of us wanted different kind of parathas. The waiter kept interrupting and said ""matter-of-factly"" that I can give you 2 parathas. While that confused some of us who just wanted one and asked for clarification he continued to say he can and will only give 2 parathas. Until we pushed he wasn't even willing to clarify why he was sitting an arbitrary limit to what we can order. Turns out they have one guy employed to cook parathas and phulka so they can only give 2 parathas per order since the guy can make more phulkas / rotis at the same time. The best part was after the meal when we gave the feedback to the manager he was arguing that there was nothing wrong in the waiter's attitude and that he would rather limit what the customer can order than hire one more person or remove it from the menu. Definitely would not be returning to the place anytime soon nor would recommend for anyone I know."
4.0,Good restaurant with dhaba feeling. Ordered paneer tikka and veg seekh kabab in starters . Both were very good. Ordered veg curry in main course that was little spicy and their khulhad lassi is must try. Overall a very good place to eat.
4.5,Best restaurant in brookefield area. Super awesome food quality and theme.  Staff is excellent.  Have to book in advance due to long wait on weekends.   Only negative I feel is taste appear same for different dishes.  But still it stands out
4.5,"Located in city, this place gives an ambience of dhaba with its cots and tables. The lassi is one of the best i have tasted in this city! Lahori chicken was a little spicy but butter chicken was succulent. Overall, good place to have tasty country food.  Do opt to sit out in the terrace on khats if possible, will give you a 'dhaba' like feeling. Food is good 4/5, Ambience is good 4/5, Huge waiting queue 2/5, service a bit slow 3/5"
4.5,And the Punjabi joints like these will not only make ur taste buds feel blessed for visiting here but also keep proving that Punjabi are the next ray of hope in making Indian Cuisine an International brand. Yes taste at its peak and the right amount of spices will make u confused as to POINT out a single drawback to this restaurant. A MUST VISIT!!
3.0,"This place has an amazing decor. They have maintained full road side dhaba style with some of the sitting space in the open. Dhaba style Khatiya and grass type flooring with lantern for the lighting part. Insides have wooden flooring and some parts have stone chip flooring. The staffs are courteous. The food could have been made better. Compared to the price and ambience the food couldn't keep up. We ordered Lassi, Chicken Reshmi kabab, Malai kofta, butter chicken and butter Nan. The Malai kofta was a total disappointment."
4.5,"First visit. Amazing food and hospitality. Great ambience. Ordered paneer tikka, chicken tikka, palak paneer, bhindi masala, butter rotis, jaljeera and chach. Palak paneer especially was fresh and tasty. Must visit place for good North Indian."
4.5,"The food , the environment , the music and the whole setup was very nice . With all the khattt and stools it will give you full filling of a road side dhabha."
4.0,It will remind you of an actual punjabi dhaba. I have been to this place many times and really like the food. The lassi is nice. Not a lot of places you get the roti that you get in home. Most of them serve yoh tandoori roti. This place serves on of the soft and best roti. Both thw vegetarian and non- vegetarian is descent enough to try
4.0,This place gives you a feel of a roadside Punjabi Dhaba with rooftop open and indoor seating. I find the staff very polite and usually prompt in taking orders. Food is tasty but slightly less in terms of quantity. Try the tandoori starters and the sides with your favourite choice of Indian bread. It's a good meal.
2.0,"Went there on a weekday, there wasnt much rush.  The seating arrangement is little uncomfortable.  The Food is average, nothing special. The service is pathetic. The waiter was just waiting for us to finish food quickly and leave. Gave false information that it will take time to cook and took the whole order at once. The waiter then brought the whole order before we were half way through the starters. Until we started our main course the food was cold.  Mushroom Chilly was super spicy and not eatable. Dal Tadka can be cooked better at home. Garlic Naan was cold and rubbery. Kulcha was just fine.  I do not recommend this restaurant."
4.0,"The restaurant is situated at rooftop with indoor and open sky  seating. Ambience is typical dhaba in Punjab with low seating machiyas and Charpai. Staff is polite and you don't have to wait for their attention. We tried mushroom biryani, Baingan Bharta and chapatis. BB was awesome, biryani was good . Phulkas soft but very cold. Wish it was served hot like other restaurants do- tawa to plate. Not much choice for dessert.Use the stairs while getting down. The exercise will help you in making some place for dessert in your tummy as Kanthi sweet and Kesar are few steps away."
4.5,"Decent dhaba style food joint - sitting arrangements is definitely a point of attraction of this place. Delicious food, good staff and service. Most importantly, very close to where I stay so I can go any time I crave for Punjabi food . It could use more space to accommodate more people as I have seen several times people waiting for their 'khaat'/table"
4.0,Ambiance is really good and Lassi is awesome . All the chicken starters we ordered including one Paneer tikka and all were yumm and spicy (Which is the best part). For the main course the chicken gravy was ok types not good like starters. In all nice place to have punjabi style non-veg food
5.0,"This place is a must visit one. Everything is nice here. The food, the staff, the ambience. Gives a total dhaba feeling even being at the 4th floor. The only prob here is at the time of rains. Kulhad lassi is a should try thing here."
3.0,"Ambience: The place is very small and people have to wait for sometime during peak hours. Otherwise the ambience is good and different. Food: One of the biggest problem I see being a non vegetarian is that they only serve chicken and egg items. The items we ordered were mostly good. The flavor and taste of all the starters and gravy items were good. I felt the chicken in non - tandoori starters and main courses were slightly undercooked. So I will suggest people to go for tandoori starters and main courses.  Overall the experience was good, not the best as some of the reviews have suggested."
4.0,"Situated on the terrace of a not so noticeable building, the setup is all dhaba-style. It's not so much spacious, so I am assuming people need to wait good amount of time at the peak hours to get a table. I found the food really good this one time I visited; definitely would like to re visit to try some other dishis, then I would be in a better position to give a more legit food feedback. There's nothing much to the ambience. Just go there, grab a seat and a glass of lassi and hog! Happy eating!"
4.0,"Very Good Ambience and Equally Good Food. If you are in a mood to try Punjabi Food , this is the place you want to Go.  The only drawback is they don't serve Mutton. :("
4.0,"Very nice village like set up. Food is also really tasty, especially the paranthas. One of the best places I've been to for paranthas in Bangalore. Service is also good. Ambience: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Money: 4/5 A must visit place to have nice North Indian Food in Brookefield"
4.0,"This place is so close to my house, it's a shame I haven't visited earlier. The setting is really well done -  surprisingly a dhaba on the terrace ! Huge crowd for a weekday lunch with mostly corporates coming in for their lunches. For starters we had tandoori chicken ,followed by the stuffed aloo partha and later on ghee rice with dal makhni and chicken curry. The tandoori chicken was well done but the aloo partha wasn't upto the mark. The dal makhani was a real delight though. We ended with a lassi which was a fitting end to a good meal. Overall the ambience was neat and the food great. Wouldn't definitely visit here again!"
3.5,"Wanting a traditional Punjabi type lunch, we decided to check out Chulha today. I liked the interiors a lot with 3 different seating options. My kid loved the stones area quite some. We ordered: Masala papad: Crisp papad. Standard spicy finely chopped onions. Good stuff. Salt lassi in kullad: Excellent! Although we did feel this was a thicker version of butter milk which we also ordered. Sweet salt lime juice: Pretty good. Tandoori chicken: While we loved the masala on the outside as well as the softness of the chicken inside, a little bit better marination inside would make this perfect Sawariya chicken: Similar taste as tandoori chicken except that the masala was green. Similar marination as well. Masala boiled egg: This was a disappointment with it being regular boiled eggs with the same masala of masala papad sprinkled on top Chicken butter masala: Unfortunately a little too sweet for us. Chicken pieces were quite big but the same marination issue existed here too. Veg Kolhapuri: This wasn't as spicy as expected and it was floating in oil! Butter kulcha, butter naan, phulka: All of these were good Veg fried rice: Tasted a bit burnt with not much flavor Service could do with a lot more geniality! Why am I still going with 3.5 despite an average experience? Because of the absolutely lovely old Hindi songs they were playing and the overall ambience :)"
4.5,Good food.. awesome ambience and service!! Would love to visit again. Recommend for people looking out for budget friendly and amazing Punjabi food.
1.0,"On Aug 12,  we have been to this restaurant near Cosmos, Whitefield.  The worst service I have seen till now. We ordered veg paneer butter masala and found a BONE in it. When we complained it to the manager, he was not even ready to apologise. He started arguing ""We have only one kitchen and such things will happen"".  Seriously!!!  We were surprise to hear that. They are not even sure what they serve is pure veg or not. And jeera rice was not even cooked properly.   Never thought we will have such kind of worst experience with one of the renowned restaurant. They don't even care about the customers. Do whatever as they like. Guys never go to this  restaurant where, they are not even sure about what they serve."
4.0,"Went to this place on 13th aug. This was second time i went to thia resturant. Awsome taste of kalmi kabab. Any chicken preparation is of awsome taste. Chicken lasuniya was also delicious. Last time i ordered ccdd special kabab in starters, however they took a bit of time to prepare, but the final product was very tasty since they put so much effort in that. Only thing is ambience is good only in night time, in day time u would prefer if it would have been air conditioned. I would recommed other people to definitely try this resturant in AECS layout."
4.5,"Food is really good. Went here for casual dinner. Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Usually this place is a little crowded on weekends but our timing was perfect that day, we did not have to wait a single minute."
4.5,This rooftop restaurant is packed and u need to be ready for about 40min waiting specially on a weekend. The food is nice but service is a bit slow. I enjoyed desi ghee phulka and mughlai chicken.
4.0,"Came to chulha chauki da dhaba for a team lunch and was surprisingly amazed by the village like ambience set in this place.The Masala buttermilk was really good,it had a hint of ginger and mint and I think that's a very good combination.Starters were quite yum and so was the MainCourse with paneer butter masala and Indian breads. Food 5/5 Quality 4/5 Service 3.5/5"
4.5,"Was craving for desi food since quite some while. Hopped to Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba and boy, I wasn't disappointed. This is by far one of the best places in Bangalore that serves more than appreciable desi food. Pros: 1. Lassi was on point. Both sweet, and salted lassi were nothing less than amazing. 2. Daal Makhni and Chicken Lahori were exceptionally  delectable. 3. One of the best desi ambience in Bangalore, with open-air seating and bamboo furniture and a Manja(or Khaat) in the middle. Cons:  Only one con- the service was too slow and the staff was too lost. This maybe due to the fact that I visited the place on a Sunday.  But if you're in the mood to have some desi food, well, don't think twice! This is your place."
1.0,"Worst experience ever..!! went there with huge expectations but came back with regret. No hospitality, substandard service. I advice please don't ruin your time going there. Disappointed..!!!"
4.0,"Good place in Bangalore to get that dhaba feel with quality food. The only disappointing factor is waiting, weekends it will be full and one has to wait for 15-30 min. Overall a good place to be."
5.0,Excellent food......... Good roof top................. Must go early or else you will have to wait in long queue............................
4.5,"Hands-down, the starters are their strong point. They make sure that all your wait is worth it. Would specially recommend the ginger / garlic chicken. They make it as juicy as possible with the perfect amount of spice to it. In my numerous visits to the joint, I have never come across a stale or uncooked tandoori chicken. They serve it as fresh as it can be and when it is coupled with the masala papad, the combination becomes unbeatable. Would also like to mention the achaari chicken tikka which always reminds me of Delhi (the Delhi boy has spoken).  We ordered a malai kabab, butter naan and butter stuffed kulcha, kadai chicken and chicken mughlai ( you have only chicken in non veg ). The malai kebab was awesome. It was marinated nicely and the aromas of Punjab tickled the taste buds. The chicken was so tender and succulent that it ought to be praised. The naan, kulcha and the curries were good!!!"
4.5,Easily one of the best Punjabi joints in Kundanalli! The food was an absolute delight and the butter melted across in streams. Loved the ambiance and the classical music they had around. Great service! Great taste!
4.5,Have been here 3 to 4 times and haven't been disappointed a bit. The ambiance is really good and it has a open roof top as well. I'm not sure about the veg food but non veg food is truly delicious. Do try out their Punjabi chicken dishes. And not to forget the lassi. They could work a bit more on the cleanliness though.
4.0,"Visited this place more than 10 times and it never disappoints me in terms of food as well as the courtesy. Amazing north Indian food, with good ambience, you get to sit on country side wooden beds. Go for ghee phulka you will love it."
4.5,"Very nice place. My second visit. Good place for people craving for North Indian style/ punjabi food. Ordered butter chicken and dal makhni, both were quite good. Its crowded even on weekdays, had to wait 10 mins for the table on a wednesday hence plan accordingly."
4.5,This place is mother of spice.... ummmmhhhh.... i love spice food...after a long time found osm spice place to dine in....chille gobi.. kolapuri....sheek kabab...overall Good
4.0,Love the place because of the ambience and the food.. been in this outlet of theirs twice and was never disappointed.. a friend of mine recommend me and would now recommend everyone.. try the biryani especially ..
4.0,"This restaurant has been given a dhaba look. They have indoor as well as outdoor seating which is a big positive. Problem with the dhaba look is the seating, they have uncomfortable seats without back rest which might not be suitable for old people.  Coming to the food, we ordered lime soda, butter chicken, tawa chicken and rotis. The butter chicken was good and really resembled the type we find in Delhi. There was a load of butter in the chicken which reminds us why we should visit this place. Tawa chicken had thick gravy resembling kadhai chicken. I would recommend this place for all the people who are devoid of the north Indian style food here in bangalore.   Food - 9/10 Ambience - 8/10 Service - 7/10"
4.5,"The best restaurant for Indian food near the whitefield area. Even though we ordered hot garlic chicken for starters and that was amazing, its the standard dishes like chicken tikka masala or butter chicken that stand out. Getting a seat during lunchtime is difficult. Go early to avoid a queue"
4.0,"Good Authentic Food. Place is compact but had good ambiance. Semi Opened place so will not have AC Running. Difficult during summer season but can try for Dinner . Bit crowdy ,worth giving a try . Prices are not too high which is good"
5.0,"A 5.0! Finally. I've given a 5.0 very very rarely, never for a lunch place, never for an Indian cuisine restaurant, because there are just so many things that can go wrong. And it's easy to spot a mistake with dishes that are quite close to your heart (or rather, stomach). There's either too much of the scary red color, too much oil, the breads are too tough and you end up feeling queasy and stupid for deciding to eat out. Even if the food passes the scrutiny, there's always the service. Either indifferent or too loud. But these guys, they just got everything right.  The Food: Hara Bhara Kebab - Simply scrumptious. The spices were just right. The outside was crispy. The inside was soft. Not the weird squishy kind of soft, but the crumbling kind of soft! I went back to the last piece of kebab after the meal, and it was still crunchy (not hard, not soggy, crunchy!!!) and how! Gobi Paratha - Crispy outer layer and the tastefully done stuffing just peeking through. Could have done with a tad more salt though. Just a wee bit. Garlic Naan - Been long since I had naan that was soft and slightly crisp and delightfully garlicky. Satisfied all my requirements of garlic naan. Baigan Bharta - The star of the day! The strong smokey flavour clashed wonderfully with the mild ghee; for one without the other would have been disastrous. Phulka - Was extremely light and fluffy, split cleanly into two, the mark of a true phulka. Veg Biriyani - Mild spices, colorful, well cooked veggies, soft rice. Buttermilk: Light, right amount of ginger, curry leaves, cold, refreshing, just what was required to balance the meal. Masala papad - You want to know how it was? Really?  The Service: We were just the two of us and were given our seats immediately. However, judging by the crowd pouring in, I'd recommend reservation. We were courteously guided to the outside seating area which was charmant. Wicker chairs and copper jugs. The whole shebang. The entire service was seamless. We never had to wait for a thing; to order, to clear the plates, for the bill; even the food arrived quickly. Though they were quick and attentive, their presence was non obtrusive.  The monies: All this added up to 770, which I find hard to call expensive, in the days of Toits and ABCs and Chianti's. Give me a Chulha Chauki da Dhaba over a Toit, any day!"
4.0,I have been to this place twice. The staff is very well mannered. The ambience has a rustic appeal to it. It also holds an outdoor seating arrangement. The whole seating arrangement has a dhaba look to it. The food is good but I found the service a little slow. They should also probably have a bigger waiting area since the place is often filled. Food - 4.5/5 Ambience - 3.5/5 Price - 4/5
4.0,"The ambience of the this place gives the feel of north side dhabas. Food quality was superb. I liked sawariya chicken, chicken butter masala and lassi the most. Place is small though so too much crowd and delay in orders can be expected."
4.5,"Not a big fan of Dhabas or North Indian cuisine, I had visited this place after getting rave reviews from a fellow foodie buddy especially as its close to my place. The first day it had a wait time of about 30 minutes & I have never seen this place empty ever since. Thanks to their food & fun ambience I have already been there multiple times. The seating arrangement is real fun & casual.They even have a typical dhaba style charpai. Iam yet to get theopportunity to sit there! sigh!The staff are courteous & the atmosphere here is super energetic with people chit chatting at the top of their voices with energetic Punjabi music playing in the background.Theimmensely tasty yet not very heavy on thetummy food (which is notvery typical of north Indian dishes ) ,is what appeals to me the most. To name a few of the dishes I have had - Chicken Biryani, Stuffed Kulcha, Egg Paratha, CCDB special chicken kebab, Chicken Punjabi, chilli chicken & the famous Lassi. The egg paratha & Lassi are a must have.A nice place for a hearty meal if you stay in the area close by or are looking for a place to eat in the Brookefield area. They also have takeaway, though the wait time might be long especially in weekends."
4.5,"Full marks for the decoration,  theme and ambience they have created here. Old Bollywood Hindi songs on their playlist. Best North Indian food in Bangalore. I tried Chicken Sawariya, Chicken Angara, Bhindi Masala and Dal Tadka here. The dishes were spicy and authentic. Fresh Lime Soda was also very Good. If you are really hungry and want to try an awesome north indian food in the outskirts of Bangalore,  This is the place!"
4.0,Place is compact but has an authentic Punjabi ambience. Food is really good. Lassi is too good. Crew are very friendly and caring.
4.5,"1. I really liked this place. 2. But a big caution : Try to reach early, otherwise you will end up waiting at the end of a long queue. There is no option to book over phone. 3. Food was really tasty and the ambiance was also nice."
3.5,"Went to try this proper north indian place with my new north indian friends from work. Ambience was great. Roof top restaurant was dimly lit and combined with the perfect weather of Bangalore, it was amazing ;-) :-D   Based on suggestions from my friends we had  Veg sheek kebab - 3.5/5  It was well cooked and spices were proper. But lacked a certain flavour that i expected.   Paneer do pyaza with rotis - 4/5 This dish was great. Best of the day!! Paneer was soft and cooked to perfection. Little spicy and just the way i like it :-D rotis were average.  Dal tadka- 2.5/5 This was just an usual dhal dish . Nothing spl. And I felt like it wasnt perfect for the rotis.  Sweet and salt lassi - this is my first tym trying lassi. So nothing to compare it with. I liked the sweet lassi. Salt wasn't of my liking. And it was overall very heavy and filling.   Service was good. Clean tables. Well managed. And for 4 of us the bill came upto 918rs. I think thats a decent amount. Yet to try non veg. Will hopefully try it soon ;-P  Overall 3.5/5  Food 3.5/5 Service 4/5  VFM 4/5"
5.0,Superb food. . Always a pleasure to drop in at this place. . Perfectly set up ambience to give a perfect dhaba experience. . Panner tikka starter and their rotis and panner ke sabziyan are jus finger licking good. .  only problem is the space and the crowd. . A great place to dine at with family and friends to enjoy the best flavours of India cuisine. .
3.5,"This place has decent ambience but the interiors are a tad bit dim.. Food is really good.. Except for chicken - which sometimes is a little overcooked.. I would recommend Malai Paneer - very tasty appetizer.. Lassi is a must if you visit this place.. The rich creamy texture and great taste will leave you wanting for more.. Quantity and quality of food is good.. But, don't forget to get a table reserved or you might might end up waiting for a long time.. Else, you can there early.."
2.5,Thou the food was nice but order was shuffled. I ordered for chicken masala but received mushroom masala.. also in place of ghee rice received jeera rice. Highly disappointed.. I will think many times before placing order.
5.0,"Your search for a decent dhaba stops here!! Though its inside brick walls, the feel looks quite similar to a proper dhaba. Naan is something you shouldn't miss and lassi is a must. If your taste buds crave for dhaba style of food, dont have second thoughts!!!  Coming to the food; we ordered a malai kabab, butter naan and butter stuffed kulcha, kadai chicken and chicken mughlai ( you have only chicken in non veg ). The malai kebab was awesome. It was marinated nicely and the aromas of Punjab tickled the taste buds. The chicken was so tender and succulent that it ought to be praised. The naan, kulcha and the curries were good !!!"
4.0,"Very close to authentic punjabi culinary. This place offers you a tribal yet comfortable ambience. Lets get straight to food... Punjabi food !!!  Loved their butter chicken which they call 'Chicken makhanwala'. Very thick , creamy close to authentic Dal makhni. ( A lot better than most restaurants in Bangalore )  Their kulchas are a must try ( either stuffed or plain ones ) The portion size could have been better. Chilled buttermilk would be the best option to end your meal  or to make place for dessert !!  A little slow on the serving though but its justified considering the peak hour and a long waiting queue for table. I would rate them  3.5/5 on serving 3.5/5 on ambience 4/5 on food( all points for taste )  If any punjabi is longing for a traditional butter chicken , this place would not disappoint you :)"
3.0,Like d place...food was also good...disappointed with the staff his behavior was not rude but the moment v entered we ordered starters nd then he started asking to order d main course also with starter..v asked for some time...the guy keep on coming after every 10min for order main course...which ws quite irritating..dude for ur info people come out not just to have food but also to spend some times with frnds..
4.0,"Superb Ambience, sort of rusty theme. Service was quite okay. It seems to be quite rush area most of the days. So you might have to wait for your chance. Quite a crowded place, would suggest for a group feast. You would love the ambience. Overall good for family and friends to hangout."
4.0,"Had a lavishing lunch over here. Although we need to wait for half an hour the end was good. We had some chicken cuisine's chicken angara, Punjabi masala, garlic chicken;naan and Gulab jamun served so hot it was really delicious . Ambience is ok with full dhaba style seatings. Service is also fine. Worth a try."
5.0,Visited the place a couple of times and always enjoyed it. Ambience and staff are amazing. It's our favorite place for comfort food. Just ask them about the spiciness before ordering.
3.0,"I had been to the chulha chauki of jaynagar many times. Thinking of that taste I tried here. But it seems to be different. Not the taste I got at the other location. There is one bad thing about this restaurant - they keep you wait and strive in hunger for atleast 20-25 mins just to enter into the dhaba. And don't understand why the waiter at the entrance shows attitude. Very rude staff. And the food is nothing soooo great. We ordered for lemon chicken and that turned out so tasteless. Chicken tikka was not any great . Phulkas were served cold. They want you to leave the table quick. The waiters won't even ask you before taking away your plates. If I consider the price, the taste is OK OK types. And nothing great here to hype about."

3.5,"Pretty good place. The furniture and ambiance compliments the ideology behind the venture, even though the short coir stools are too short for anyone above 6 feet. Food is good, and the dhaba inspirations are clearly visible. The overall food is a bit on the spicier side, so be warned before ordering the same with extra spice."
3.5,"as one of the best dine out place at Brookfield area, this place just gives you a feeling  of being in some streets of Punjub and sipping some amazing chilled Lassi :) Great food .. good value for money .. I am a huge fan of Punjabi food...just love the extra spices in my gravy :D if you are in this area and having some craving for some mouth watering butter Kulchas and paneer kofta or Shahi paneer then this is the right place to be :)"
4.0,Had been here for several treats. A great getaway from well decorated and sophisticated restaurants. It  surely brings out the Dhaba feeling - true to its name. Chicken keema is my favourite here. Do try out the lassi.  It's yum. The rotis do get hard at times but manageable. There's always a queue.  So please get reservations. Starters are delicious Have almost tried everything and the tandoori is awesome.
4.5,"The restaurant is decorated like a typical roadside dhaba on highways. The ambience is kinda good and lives upto its concept. Now about the food , food is really good try veg nonveg almost everything tasted really good. So hope the quality is maintained over time ."
3.5,Good ambience good food. Lassi is Very tasty! must give it a try. Takes time to serve though and place is congested. overall good one time visit!
4.5,Very cosy and nice ambience. Very tasty North Indian food! I loved the lassi as well.. I think I'm going to visit the place more often and try out different dishes
4.0,"If you are looking for a quintessential punjabi food restaurant in AECS Layout / Kundalahalli area, then Chulha Chowki Da Dhaba should be visited at least once. My rating here is a combination of their dine-in experience and home delivery.  As it is located on the AECS Layout main road, it is pretty easy to spot. They have a waiting area right outside the restaurant where the guard would keep fiddling with the counter given to him by the restaurant (remember Ranbir Kapoor's AXE Blast ad !!). The restaurant has 2 sections in which 30% is open-air and rest is air conditioned. They do live by their name as they have a complete cane based furniture giving the ideal dhaba feel but keep it a bit classy with the glass top tables in order to conform to the Bangalore crowd.  Hands-down, the starters are their strong point. They make sure that all your wait is worth it. Would specially recommend the ginger / garlic chicken. They make it as juicy as possible with the perfect amount of spice to it. In my numerous visits to the joint, I have never come across a stale or uncooked tandoori chicken. They serve it as fresh as it can be and when it is coupled with the masala papad, the combination becomes unbeatable. Would also like to mention the achaari chicken tikka which always reminds me of Delhi (the Delhi boy has spoken). The veg starters are no where behind in this context. In spite of not being a big fan of potato, I always end up having their aloo chillias it is a good amalgamation of indian and a bit of chinese style of cooking. Thepaneer tikka can still go through some rounds of review from the cooks as it does not really adhere to the punjabi taste that a visitor might expect, with the before-mentioned being a bit too sweet.  Chicken handi and chicken butter masalaare the front-runners as far as the non veg main course go, with paneer butter masala complimenting them very well. Dal makhanican be a little disappointing as it turns out to be a little too tangy for the authentic punjabi taste. Tandoori roti and butter garlic naan are the breads that one would enjoy. Would recommend to avoid the chapatis as they are maida-based; something that a foodie would not really enjoy.  Don't forget to end the meal with the meetha paan topped with rose petal.  Taste : 4/5 Ambience : 4/5 Service : 4/5 Value for money : 4/5"
5.0,Awesome Experience. Super food but price is little more. The best part is sitting and eat outside in open sky at Khatiya. I simply loved the environment and food.
4.0,"Reviewing for delivery experience only. Have ordered from this place multiple times during lunch time. The taste and quality of their north indian food is unbeatable. If you are craving for good north indian food, this is a recommended place They have a wide variety of dishes available in their menu like lemon chicken etc. But we have always stuck to ordering basics such as chicken tikka, malai tikka, chicken tikka masala, chicken butter masala etc. And have never been disappointed. Although i would not recommend their malai kofta-it simply dsnt lool and tatse like malai kofta."
5.0,Simply superb...lassi rocks.. Veg biryani with malai kofta is amazing.... Tandoori chicken n butter Chicken are a must try over here... Only con is uv gotta wait for 20-30 mins to get a table
3.0,A 3 because I was made to wait for one and a half hours just to be informed later that there were no tandoori items left! I was disappointed. I had to order a not so good chicken lollipop that I only regretted having.
3.5,Very good place nice ambience the taste of the food is good...the service is fast the ambience was nice.....please avoid Sunday's and Saturday 's huge waiting queue.but it is worth the wait...
4.0,"Located in city, this place gives an ambience of dhaba with its cots and tables. The lassi is one of the best i have tasted in this city! Lahori chicken was a little spicy but butter chicken was succulent. Overall, good place to have tasty country food."
4.0,Non vegetarian food is good. Sitting is OK. Food is very spicy. Always go with reservation as it always crowded in lunch timing. Food is bit expensive. For 3 people we got bill of 1500.
4.0,Nice dhaba type ambiance inside restaurant..this place go easy on pocket...yummy Punjabi food...Punjabi food lovers can visit this place again n again..
4.5,"The place has a nice ambience, and the open terrace is awesome, if you visit in the evening! The service is apt, and the people, helpful. Probably one of the few places in Bangalore with tasty food in budget. I visited twice, tried different things and they were all good. You have got to try Aloo Paranthas, Lassi and Gulab jaumn. They serve melt-in-mouth hot Gulab jamuns :)"
4.0,"Yet another place to enjoy Punjabi/North Indian cuisine. Place has posh dhaba look with cots and bamboo chairs. Coming to food, lassi here is not thick as in other Punjabi places, they even add essence to it which I personally don't like. They make the great butter masal, have tried it with both paneer & chicken. Both time it was great. Starters were also tasty. But on weekends it ll b heavily crowded. Few tyms u have to wait for hours to get a table. But great food makes you feel worth d wait."
4.0,"Great North indian food! Been there multiple time,as well as placed home delivery orders a lot of times. I can order almost any item ,and more or less have liked and loved their food on most occasions. Be it vegetarian or non-vegetarian dishes,both are equally good in quality and quantity."
4.0,"Good Indian food at decent price. Do opt to sit out in the terrace on khats if possible, will give you a 'dhaba' like feeling. Food is good 4/5, Ambience is good 4/5, Huge waiting queue 2/5, service a bit slow 3/5"
4.5,"Your search for a decent dhaba stops here!! Though its inside brick walls, the feel looks quite similar to a proper dhaba. Naan is something you shouldn't miss and lassi is a must. If your taste buds crave for dhaba style of food, dont have second thoughts!!!"
4.0,"Have been there recently. Good ambience, Tandoori starters are good in taste, Angara Chicken Masala really spicy.. And Lassi in Kulhad really mouth watering...."
4.0,"Do not go by the cover picture of this page and assume that you'll get a seating place so easily. This place is generally packed, though you'll get seats easily as the service is fast and they clean up quickly!  ^That said, this place gives us the Dhaba feel right when you enter it.  Pros : 1. The food reminds you of the real punjabi style food with a touch of ""maa-ke-haath-ka-khana"" in it. 2. Lassi and Buttermilk here are a must have. Accompany them with a masala papad and you won't regret it. 3. Very Quick Service. The waiter's here are extremely courteous and always put on a smile.  Cons : 1. They SHOULD really tone down the price a bit. It's a little pricy for a small group, given that each dish costs around 250-300. So generally, going for a couple of dishes is ruled out. 2. Parking can be a problem sometimes, if you are on a 4-wheeler."
4.0,Food and ambience is very good. Only con is the seating. Some may like and some may not like cane stool-type seating. Had lunch recently on weekends but had less crowd than usual. Maybe due to the summers.
4.0,"I happened to visit this place out of the blue with my brother and a friend. We were searching for a good north Indian or flavours of Punjab type ka restaurant and we hopped in the right place. Go to this place to have nice food not nice time with friends or family as it is too busy to talk or eat slowly.  The place is located in the most busy street around the block in Aecs layout and always has waiting, would recommend to reserve a table and go. The ambience is almost the same as the JP nagar outlet but the service sucks, it is as if there are too many people doing nothing. No one gives a shit to what you are trying to say.  Coming to the food; we ordered a malai kabab, butter naan and butter stuffed kulcha, kadai chicken and chicken mughlai ( you have only chicken in non veg ). The malai kebab was awesome. It was marinated nicely and the aromas of Punjab tickled the taste buds. The chicken was so tender and succulent that it ought to be praised. The naan, kulcha and the curries were good but it was too much of chicken everywhere with no  variety. Too little gravy. We ordered a lassi too which was as good as in Amritsar.  We started off enjoying our meal nicely and couldn't continue it since it was overloaded with chicken all the way though it was cooked well. The prices are not too high but the service definitely needs improvement. The crowd still keeps pouring in as we come out of the place with a meetha pan in our mouths."
4.0,"I dont know how I missed out reviewing such a nice restaurant. It has a wonderful ambience and it gives the feel of a dhaba on a highway. Service is a little slow, mainly cause of the untrained staff. However, the food is brilliant right from the kalmi kabab to the angara chicken, everything is just delicious."
4.5,i will give a 4.5 for this!!!!! nice food.. great starters.. price?? not at all costlty.. lovely ambience.. must try for all foodies..!! dont know about other outlets but brookfiled one is pretty good.. more than satisfied.
3.5,"Nice food, good starters and ok ambience.... Overall a descent place to have a nice lunch or a dinner with a group of friends or family .... Starters are nice, with ok main course"
4.0,"Yes, certainly you always find queue for good stuffs around you. Once your wait is over.. U can either have dinner under open sky or closed doors. Nice ambience, good hospitality which sometimes goes hayway when there is big queue waiting outside. Superb food, lassi and don't forget to have esp. Meetha pan from bhaiya from Madhubani, Bihar."
4.0,Awesome food and amazing ambience...
4.0,"Had dropped in here on a sunday evening and OMG the queue was REALLY long! So, either you go at 8 or after 9.30. We reached at around 8.30 and had to wait for like half an hour, but it was worth it. We had malai paneer tikka which was bursting with flavors. Also the lassi in kullad, which is a must! It was divine. We ordered malai kofta, tandoori roti and stuff kulcha for main course, which I relished to my heart's content. The quantity of kofta I felt has been decreased. But then again, it was enough for two. The ambience as usual was chirpy and lively."
3.0,"We went there for a dinner on sat night.. The hotel doesn't allow reservation of table on weekends..so it's first come first...when we reached there , it was pretty crowded...the staff is courteous.. We waited for about 25-30 mins ...but it was worth a wait..when we entered inside , we were guided to a table which had gravelled floor. We got a corner seat..table and chair made of bamboo..it was a superb experience.. This hotel is made on a roof top. But they have decorated it well with all the lanterns, gravel, bamboo chairs etc to make it feel like a dhaba... Super good theme..light old Hindi music was going on..impressive.. Now let's proceed towards food.. While we waited outside we had already gone through the menu and have decided ours so we wanted to save our time inside but to our surprise they came to take our order pretty late.. A negative point.. And on top of it they served also late..but after serving they are in hurry to clear off the table..didn't like that attitude.. Anyways, we ordered kulhad ki lassi sweet... It was the typical Punjabi lassi..little too sweet for me.. Then we ordered sheek kabab...it was delicious..around 5 pieces in one plate.. Then for main course we ordered chicken Punjabi masala and roti..this was also very tasty just little spicy but the perfect punjabi style,so just dnt forget to mention it at the time of ordering if u want less spicy...overall food was good,  ambience was superb , staff was nice ... So overall 3.0."
4.0,"I have been staying in AECS Layout since 2 years, but visited this place for the first time. There are no doubts about the food served. Each and every item on the menu is worth a try. I was surprised with the quality of phulkas, as its very difficult to get good phulkas in restaurants. They simply melted in the mouth. Service was average. There is a scope of improvement in service. But food...loved it!"
1.0,Pathetic service for home delivery. Within 6 km radius they are asking for a minimum order of Rs 1000/-. The guy on the phone was an arrogant snob and was speaking like he was doing us a favour by delivering food. Avoid this place.
1.0,"The one star rating is purely for the service rendered. We reached by 12.40 for lunch and we were a big group. We were asked to wait, which we did. In the meanwhile another bigger group arrived and they were seated before us. More people kept coming and they kept seating others (although no one had reserved earlier) and they finally gave us the menu to decide, so we get quick service later. We were seated by 1.30 and then we realised that the order we had decided while waiting wasn't even given to the kitchen. The non veg starters arrived while the vegetarians had to wait. There was a 15-20 gap between each item. Only when we ask to cancel the order since our hunger had died waiting that long, did they bring out the next dish. I think they start cooking the dish when one asks them to cancel it. Never going there again. The food isn't great to waste that much time waiting."
4.5,Best food quality and service.....very nice ambiance..... Gives true feeling of a dhaba......                                              .
4.0,"Set up is awesome.theme also nice. Servicing also good. But quantity is less acording to the price...  ........ We ordered chicken kasa,tandori roti,lassi........"
4.5,"Had ordered chicken keema, chicken biriyani and bhindi fry. Overall it was excellent. Really enjoyed the preparations and will definitely look forward from this restaurant."
4.0,"Great ambience. Amazing food. Tried the lemon chicken which was absolutely amazing. I'd suggest everyone to try this out. Also tried the Afghani kabab which was something different and yes, this was amazing too and for the maincourse, it was Chicken Angara..which was spicy and too good. The lassi at this place is a must try. I'd definitely wanna go here again."
4.5,"Simply Awesome :) I have been there twice and I can say one word for the food and the guys working there .. AWESOME. I visited the restaurant during peak hours and waited for nearly half an hour both the times, but the wait was worth it. The food quality, quantity, and presentation are fab. Good job guys."
3.5,This is my favorite place in Brookefield. Food is great. Service is very slow. Ambience is good. The place remains crowded whenever you go. But they manage the crowd well. Nice place to have dinner with family n friends.
4.0,"A typical dhaba style restuarant in brookefield.   I have visited this place 4 times .The food served here is very delicious .Veg or non veg everything served here are awesome.The price is very reasonable. Service is very quick.the interior of this restuarant gives the feel of the dhaba. the place is beautifully lit with lanterns.The only problem with this place is that its always crowded,probably you have to wait to get ur seat.This is place is worth a visit if you want to try typical good north indian food.Lassi is recommended."
4.5,One of the lesser known restaurants serving Punjabi and north Indian Foods. The taste and the ambiance is spot on. Their service is quick. Waiting can be a lot at times on weekdays. Better ask about the waiting time before you leave. Dal Makhni and Paneer are a must try!
3.5,"Though I went on blazing hot afternoon but I didn't factored it in my rating as it was conscious decision and I knew this place is not Ac.  Well not having Ac works in your favor during final bill time. So better go during evening   or not so sunny afternoon. Then you will enjoy better.   Coming to ambience, typical dhabha rustic look with cane n jute furniture. Personally think chairs can be lil more comfortable..  Food wise Chilli chicken was nice, mushrooms masala was balanced width  right amount of spices, Yellow daal was like typical dhabha taste, paneer khadai was average. Baigan bharata was below average... Not recommended.  Lassi and lime juice was almost room temp.. When checked with staff he said their fridge does so much cooling and no ice... Found excuse quite lame and honest.  Tandoori roti was average and misi roti with butter was impressive.   Cost wise it's value for money.   Again go on non sunny afternoon or evening is the take away."
5.0,Really nice place with decent ambiance. Also the food was really good and the price was reasonable. From starters to dessert lots of varieties for vegetarians. However the catch is they don't have ice cream but otherwise excellent experience.
4.0,"The review is about takeaway and all veg food. Was in the area and thought of eating here as it was recommended by a friend. We went there on a Saturday evening and there was lot of waiting. Two things came in mind, good food but long wait. Thus ordered a takeaway. Dum aloo, Baigan Bharta, Dal Tadka, Jeera Rice and some breads. The food was good but not too good. May be the expectations were high seeing the crowd there. Dum aloo was way too spicy, but overall nice food."
2.5,"they say its non-veg place. But actually its chicken, chicken and chicken. Menu is full of chicken. No fish, Mutton or anything else.   For veg, less option.   Long wait time will kill you waiting outside near the stair where no space. I see people siting in stair waiting for their turn.   Food taste was ok, not bad at all.   Overall, the place is good if you have too much time and dying to have full spicy, tasty, hot but ordinary varieties of north indian food."
3.5,"A must visit place for people who love north Indian dishes. This place is usually crowded and you dont have advance booking option. But their list of dishes available is worth the wait. I have tried their jeera aloo, dal makhni and paneer tikka masala and loved all of them, their butter milk is also great and so is the various kinds of breads available. Price is moderate as well."
4.5,Good Rooftop restaurant. Great North Indian food.. I had dinner for the first time.. Masala Pappad my favourite dish was Ghee Phulka.. Good service and ambience but serving time is around 20minutes.. Great weekend spot
2.0,"I had heard a lot about this place and i was really hyped to go here and finally when i went it was the biggest disappointment ever.  There is a huge wait time and they don't have advanced booking option. It wasn't even first come first serve, the larger the group the faster you got the seat. There is at least 1hr wait for couples. The ambience is very average. We got our food after another 30mins. We ordered chicken dahiwala which should be a bit on the sour side but this was extremely hot n spicy. The gobhi mutter was like if you get gobhi in it you were the lucky winner. And u expect the mutter to be fresh but it was the frozen ones. The tandoori roti was cold the fulka was okay. Laasi we ordered sweet but they gave it salty and when told to replace they said that we dont give sweet lassi its either salty or mix. Never been so disappointed with a dinner."
3.0,Simply average in taste don't know why so crowded... They have simply put some khat and mudha chairs ....might be new for some ppls who have not visited any village... But food is not that great.
4.0,"Have gone to this place on Saturday night.. They have first come first serve policy,  no reservation.  We waited in long queue..  Place is good.. Pocket friendly.. We have ordered kadai paneer,  veg sikh kebab..  Both were quite spicy..  But taste was good. Staff is friendly.. Overall good experience.."
4.5,"North Indians dying for the authentic Jeera aalo, dal makhni and butter chicken, this is the place. Finding a seat may be a dismal affair, but the struggle is worth the food's taste and the stereo DHABA look given to the place."
4.5,One of my fave restaurantsin Brookfield !! Totally adore the ambience . The food is yummy and definitely worth what we are paying for :D :D !!!!!
4.0,"This is a well known place for the people who reside nearby and is quite famous for its authentic lassi and the dhabba cots which might make you feel like a hippie on a road trek, but no, it is far from authentic yet charming to the core. We went for a reunion for the first time, and have been going there ever since. The food is excellent and it might take you to the taste lands of Punjab.  The service is commendable and this is a must visit place if you are from around. The food might be a little heavy on your pocket, but it's worth it!!"
4.5,"This is one of the best places to taste amazing tasting dishes. Any non-veg curry would taste awesome here. My favorites are Chicken lollipop, lemon chicken. The Lassis taste heavenly. Great service too. I had a really good experience during all the times that I visited this place."
4.0,"Came here to celebrate the birthday of a friend, we were seven in number. The service was polite and warm. Food veg and non veg both were fabulous. And the dhaba style setting was well done."
3.5,"Visited once few week's back. Not as cozy as the JP Nagar one, but the food is almost the same. Servers are extremely polite and humble. All the items are tasty and easily serves two. Must drop in if you are looking for nonveg Punjabi dish."
4.0,Hv been to dis place twice and it never disappoints ;) Prefer to go in evening cz of itz ambience. Service is also very good. The food is gud..don't forget to tk their special kulhad lassi ;)
3.5,Decent place!!! Saturday's will be difficult to get a place.. North Indian food authentic with the punjabi lassi.. Proper punjabi flavour and can modify dishes as per flavour
5.0,"Our kids love it here! The Malai Paneer is excellent. Reasonable selection for vegetarians. It can get crowded, so you should go a little early to beat the rush."
4.0,This place had been on my wish list for a long time & finally I went to this place. Well it didn't disappoint me. It's a good place to have a proper filling dinner. Food - we ordered 2 starters & 2 main course. Unfortunately I don't remember the name but everything was good enough  Ambience is brilliant especially the khatai outside Service is also good
4.5,Very fast n quick service... wish they maintane this fastness in future .... Taste of the food was good their curry n tandoori chicken was awesome ... coming the ambience it was good but the place bit cramped as they tried to put lot of tables in small area ... may be they can remove 2 set of table so that place look bit nice....
4.5,"I went here for lunch with my team members. It was sunny outside and we sat in open rooftop, so we felt hot out there. But the ambiance is o give you the feel of a dhaba or village. All of us ordered variety of food but I became fan of their kulhad ki lassi. I loved drinking lassi in that kulhad and the taste was really good, not so sweet and not so sour the way I like lassi. Also special mention to their parathas and boneless chicken punjabi masala. I loved the food here and forgot the hot weather in sometime. Must try if you want to enjoy desi north indian food and got bored of having food in multicuisines. :) Ambiance : 3.5 Food : 4.5 Service : 4"
4.0,"Chulha Chowki Da Dhaba, The name is quite long and such prefixes with Dhaba are quite common these days. But this name is doing justice. An authentic dhaba cuisines and so is the ambience. All the items we ordered were different from each other and rejuvenated the taste buds. Starting from starters to main course to desserts all were awesome. We were craving for authentic veg food and we were not disappointed.   CCDD Platter, Veg seekh roll, Palak Paneer, Dal Tadka, Methi Malai Matar, Gulab Jamuns all were just sumptuous.  Taste : 8/10. Special Mention for dal Tadka 10 /10 Ambience : 7/10,  Little Cramped  Pocket : 7.5/10.   Must Visit."
4.0,"Visited on a friday evening. Luckily got a seat for 2 since we reached early. [Saw people waiting outside when we were leaving around 8.30]  Roof top, with dim lights and candles. Ambience is nice; But not a cozy/romantic place since its crowded, and seats are close to each other. Can hear laughter and chit chat everywhere. There is No music too.  Food is quite tasty, and service was good. Not expensive, hence a Value for money."
3.5,"Visited this place for lunch. Got the table without any hassle, probably cause it was a weekday. Starters were good especially the lollipop which were tossed in schezwan sauce. Kawab was also good. Main course is ok. Could be better though.  Overall, a decent place which is lightweight on your pockets. Ambience - 3(will feel like a dhaba, that's what it is called ryt..) Quality - 3.5 Quantity - 3.5 Hygiene - 3.5 Cost - 4  Overall 3.5"
4.0,"Went there for lunch after reading good reviews on zomato.You can imagine the rush becuase we got waiting on Wednesday.Also this place doesnt allow advance booking .The ambience is nice,feels lika a dhaba.We ordered panner chatpata and veg seek kabab for starters.Both were tasty.Lassi was also good.Food was equally good with variety.Though i felt panner was bit harder so that can be improved."
4.5,"We visited this place last night.. We wanted to visit it for some time now but would not get a seat as we would be late or something.. This time we got the seat luckily.. I must it is too crowded usually.. The ambience is gud.. More like a dhaba although the actual dhaba feel is not there but still a decent place. Food over here is simply delicious.. We ordered sawariya kebab which was mint paste based kebab.. It was yumm.. Other starter that we ordered was reshmi kebab.. It was different than the reshmi kebab we get anywhere else.. It was kebab wrapped in an omelet.. This kebab was a tad bit disappointing.. For main course we ordered lassuni chicken, chicken biryani and roti. The lassuni chicken was too good and biryani was mildly spiced.. Overall the food was delicious.. Coming to service, it is good. The waiters are good and courteous. Overall a good and budget friendly specially for chicken lovers."
4.5,Exceeds expectations. Great food and mellow ambience. Diwali handi was a winner! Highly recommended on a hungry day with no room to go wrong.
3.0,"Just returned from lunch at Chula Chauki Da Dhaba to celebrate our colleagues farewell. Clearly the place is popular, as the restaurant was packed. The dcor is pretty basic with low seating bamboo chair and tables, infact it was rather austere, if I should say so! One neat thing though, was the water served in a copper jug.  We settled down to order and the menu cant get any more Punjabi than this. All of us ordered lassis and buttermilk to drink (which were very good) and for starters we got kalmi kabab, lemon chicken, paneer chilly and a veg sheek kabab.  For mains, we got variants of rotis, palak paneer, kadai mushroom, kadai chicken and a chicken biriyani  The kalmi was pretty good, as the chicken was well marinated and cooked, the lemon chicken tasted good as well, but along with the other starters were just too spicy for my palate, infact the vegetarians in the group were sweating a river //seeing us mop our sweat and tears, my colleague jested that she was happy, she had such an impact with the team!//  Of the mains, I only liked the palak paneer, as it was the only dish, which was creamy and had limited spice and hence we could actually taste the flavours, the rest of mains were pretty run of the mill. The breads were pretty good tough.  Service was pretty brisk and a bit impersonal, but then it was a super busy day! My true highlight of the meal was the lovely sweet paan, which is made on premise, which bought back some life to my toasted tongue.  Sorry wasnt bowled over with the food, enough to want to go back again, but clearly this place has its fans and you can take a chance.  Dcor-6.5  Food-7  Service-7  Overall - 7"
4.5,"Nice ambiance. Parking facility rite opposite the restaurant. Roof top. Helpful staff-- all this summed up my 2nd experience at this outlet. Decently priced dishes served here. Biriyani was the best but slightly less in quantity, but it gets heavy on the stomach. Chicken Punjabi Masala is yummy, thick curry and goes well with Kulcha/ roti. This part of city has lot of eateries but this one stands out for the quality of food they serve.                                                                 grubitizer.com"
4.0,"Visited this place during weekday lunch time. It was Lil crowded but we got place in few mins. Ambience looks totally like the name ""dhaba"". Service was fast and good.  Coming to food we ordered paneer Tikka as starter, Masala soda sweet and salt, kadai paneer, baby corn Masala, tandoori roti, stuffed kulcha, garlic Naan and plain kulcha.  Starter was really tasty and very well marinated. Naan and roti was served soft and hot. In curries, baby corn Masala was too good but kadai paneer was Lil spicy for our taste.  Overall a good place and totally worth the money"
3.5,The street had a chain of restuarants. We went there during a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty crowded. The food was good. The masala pappad could have had a little more seasoning. The lassi was very thick and creamy. The garlic chicken tasted decent but it had a lot more batter than the chicken. So when I tried a piece when it was mildly warm it was more chewy and not appreciable. The bindi masala was good. I personally liked it. The service was poor. We waited a long time to get our food. The waiters did not attend to us properly. The dhaba set up was one good thing. Overall I would go there again to try more items on their menu hoping they have a better service that time.
4.0,"Loooonnggg waiting on weekends! I have been here a couple of times on weekends and never have I got a seat before atleast half an hour of waiting and they don't take reservations on phone. But its totally worth it! The vegetarian food here is amazing. Some must tries are paneer tikka, malai kofta and dal tadka. Their Lassi is the best I've had in Bangalore! Though, their paneer vegs might disappoint you. Full points to the Dhaba style ambiance. Service could be better. A must visit for Punjabi food lovers."
3.5,"A different village style setup , aimed towards making an impact the moment you enter. Food is decent, a treat for lovers of spicy food,specially the starters. Don't miss the paan on your way out :-)"
4.5,Awesome place if you want to eat upto your throat. Better if you opt for outdoor terrace sitting as  it gives the perfect feel of a road side dhaba. Worth every penny you spend which would surely not be hit on your pocket. Lassi is something which you can't miss. Weekends are jam packed and u might have to be in waiting list. So 7:30 pm on weekends would be a good time to be hungry.
2.0,Good dhaba like setup however the service was quite bad. The waiters were kind of rude. Nobody checks on you. You have to wait really long for the food and the quantity is disappointing. The food didn't taste awesome either. Hence not going back to this place again.
3.0,"I have been to there couple of times. It is a decent restaurant which is full of techie, who always discuss about their project :P. Even i also went with my colleagues. So let us come to the review. Non veg starters were good but veg starters were very bad. Had Paneer tikka and it was very very bad in taste. Chicken Tandoori was good and so as chilly chicken. In main course, missi roti was too hard and chicken curry was bit good. The best item is lassi and a must have item there.  Ambiance: fine enough. 3 star Service: bit slow and you have to call several times to have a glass of water. 2 star Quality: Paneer item was really stale one but non veg was really amazing. 3 star Bit over priced but who cares if you are not giving treat over there.  So go over there if you are going to have non veg. For veggies find some other place."
4.5,Homely food at reasonable costs. Love the seating on the terrace and the service is also quick. Do try Chicken starters - amaze balls! Only missing is beer at this place.
4.5,Just love this place for its simple village seating style... They have kept decors very Indian... Love it   Food... Uff what to say... It's exactly what my taste buds crave for... Can't resist their food   I don't mind waiting for my table  They are super quick when it comes to service..
5.0,"Best place to have non veg. starters ( ginger chicken, garlic chicken, chilli chiken) at reasonable price..Went 3-4 times there and they never disppointed. Lassi is awesome in kulhad."
4.5,Very authentic and uniquely designed place. Good for foodies. The taste of food is amazing and can feel the flavour in each bite. Totally yummy food. Should definitely give a try and will nvr be disappointed.
4.0,This is a really a cool place with the awesome food and the surrounding. The staffs are so cool even if one bothers them too much and its always been crowded.It really gives the feel of being at home with its quality cuisines .
4.5,"One of the best restaurant in Brookefield area. Cool ambience. Went there with my frn'd and by luck got the best seat. 2 kinds of seats are there: Closed roof & open roof. Only 3 seats in open roof are there and these are the coolest one with village cot (Khatiyaa) to sit on. Food is lip smacking, in budget and service is also very welcoming and friendly. Tried Paneer tikka, daal makhni. Must try sweet lassi, it was damm good."
4.0,Great taste!!  Go and have any non veg or veg dish.  You will love it...  Chicken angara is a must have to spice up your tongue ..  Keep ready a glass of nice and sweet lassi while having angara....  Just to be on safe side. Great ambience and good service.
4.0,"One of the most affordable places near Brookfield, Bangalore with good ambience and great punjabi food. Food was delicious (a bit spicy for those who doesn't prefer rich food). Tandoor chicken also didn't disappoint. The 'khatias' on the roof gives the place a punjabi ambience. No complains about the service either. No doubt the place is ready to give you a flavour of Punjab when ever you drop in."
4.0,This a must try place for those who love Punjabi food. Every item is prepared with unique gravy which is reflected in flavour. Seating arrangement is also authentic Punjabi.
4.5,"This is the one among the most loved and revered restaurant in brookefield area in Bangalore. Though there are other branches I have frequented this branch the most. This place is almost always crowded and the queue extends in the stairs to one floor below during weekend evenings too. There have been days when we had waited 45- 60 minutes for a table for 2 on Saturday and Sunday but still this place is worth every visit. Only once I had opted for takeaway and that was pretty soon even if it was a weekend. So you can imagine that their service is good but they fall short of tables due to huge crowd. There is a half closed and half rooftop open air options with cots sit on cozily just like a true dhaba. With dim lantern kind of lighting they have tried to make it give a dhaba ambience. Have tried all of their kebabs and they are all equally delicious, but a special mention for the kebab which was a chicken kebab with fried egg covering, very sadly I have forgotten the name but just loved that kebab to the core. The butter naans the tandoori rotis are all quite good and whatever chicken gravy I have tasted I have loved them all. Again a special mention of Chicken Angara , chicken Punjabi masala and chicken Handi for all the spicy chicken gravy lovers out there. When in mood for less spicy you can always opt for their extremely delicious chicken makhanwala and butter masala. The lassi in the big steel glass would remind you of any dhaba if you have visited and is extremely thick, delicious and heavy on stomach. But delivery has always been a problem from here on Sunday nights as among theseveral times I have tried to connect to this place for delivery on Sunday nights only once the restaurant had answered the call."
3.5,"The best thing about this place is seating arrangements and ambience. Food is tasty and good in quantity. I almost tried everything, and this Dhaba is pocket friendly Definitely worth a try"
4.5,"Great place for quick bite, especially small office parties, plus point is they give you complete feel of a dhaba and food is really great. Veg and Non-Veg both served with total feel of dhaba."
4.0,"Nice food, Taste just like any north Indian food. Kadhai paneer was tasty, Chicken tandoori as well.  Thick Lassi was really great! Nice Dhaba Theme. Worth for the paid price."
5.0,I have been to this place so many times and the taste always remains the same. An amazing place for lunch and dinner specially if you are a non veggie. If you like spicy go for chicken angara. Its the best and i am sure you will have to go back again.
3.5,"Very unwelcoming reception! The security guys don't let you in even if one person in the group is yet to show up. Kalmi kabab was good but chicken biryani was a let down. Economic pricing, average food and interesting seating is what this place can brag about."
3.5,"Nice place. Went there for team dinner.  Loved their kulhad lassi and some mushroom starter, the exact name I really dont remember.  Just one thing, the place to sit is really uncomfortable, I mean it really will give you back pain at times if you are there for a long time"
3.5,"The veg food is amazing here. Even though i am a hardcore non vegetarian and i tend to eat non veg in every meal possible , i have had multiple bad experiences in non veg curries here. but definitely veg food is delicious. Thats why this palce is always full and u have to go at an odd time only to get seats. The Village Ambience and the cots also are delightful. The servers are very polite."
4.0,"A good indian setup, dim lighting and 'khatiya' gives it a true dhabe wala feel. The 'methi malai matar' from here is a must have for everybody! Make sure to get reservations in advance because this place fills up fast."
4.5,Very good food and light on your pocket as well. Ambiance is average but service is good. You should definitely try sweet lassi and paneer stuff here :D
4.0,Lovely place to be with friends and family. Completely looks like a dhaba inside. Yes it was a bit too stuffy. Too many people around. I found the place clumsy. We need to be early to get the table. Food is very good. Service is fine. Worth the money one pays. Great place to enjoy provided u get a seat.
4.0,Awesome place.. We had ordered lemon chicken and it was really bad.. But all other items are awesome.. I loved paneer chatpata and the sweet lassi a lot.. V had been here at least 4-5 times.. It is little cost... But i surely recommend this place for treats!!!
4.0,"At the rooftop of a complex, with 3 other restaurants below it, it sure attracts the most crowd.  Its crowded, so you have to wait for your turn to go inside. The lighting and ambience is really good with two sitting options, one is under the roof with bamboo table and stools. The other is out in the open under the starry sky with bamboo cot and stools.  We could not get the outdoor one so we took the seat inside.  The starters, cckd spl tikka and veg sheek kabab, they were fantastic. The main course garlic naan, butter phulka, stuffed kulchas and pulav were also yummy. Since they wait to get all the items at the same time the naan had gone cold, that was let down. The sides kholapuri and paneer kofta were spicy and good.  Overall its a nice place with good service and affordable price. I would recommend you to visit."
4.0,"Its a small place that is always buzzing with people. There's mostly always waiting, but it doesn't take too much time to clear up. Loved the food. The ambience could do better, but it's definitely one of the better restaurants if you're looking for North Indian food in the streets of south Bangalore, or the whole of Bangalore for that matter. :) Doesn't burn a big hole in your pocket either!"
4.5,"Amazing food. We ordered a whole lot of dishes on the menu and were impressed by all of them. Try the malai tikka, tadka daal and the lassi. Also brilliant was the Paneer chatpot and masala papad."
3.5,"A good place in my office's vicinity for a small-affair team lunch. The chicken do-pyaza and punjabi chicken are too good, also giving the tandoori chicken a try would not be repenting. The only cuisines missing are the mutton and fish delicacies, I would suggest the restaurant to add them on the menu in the near future. Overall a fair experience."
3.5,This place has a combination of good food with good ambiance. Pure Punjabi style food cooked deliciously with a wide variety of options. Located at the 4th floor...they have a typical dhaba style setting wherein you are served by staff dressed in kurta pyajama. The best that I love is their palak paneer....so sooo yumm!!! The place however is mostly crowded so not a place I would like to sit and eat...take away is a better option thou. Overall....good food and can be tried for authentic North Indian food.
4.0,"Being one of my most favorite place for authentic north Indian food, I have visited this place plenty of times. They have a rooftop dhaba style seating and indoor seating. For starters we ordered tandoori chicken and chicken 65. Chicken was cooked to perfection. They also have great lassi on the offering. For main course we ordered chicken tikka masala and paneer butter masala. Overall a place for delicious north Indian cuisine."
3.0,"I feel this is one of the best places to visit in town. Amazing food, good quality, perfect and nice ambience. Waiters are very welcoming and warm. Service is very fast and nice. Decently priced, it is one of the best places I have visited and the best part is the quality of food. Lassi is a must try and the butter naan is superb. For online order this is the worst place, staff is rude and pathetic and also last tine I visited quality was not as good as before. Cumon guyz"
4.0,"Have been to this place several time since the time it has opened up. Here is my review about this place:  Food: I have mostly stuck with vegetarian food here. The starters are really good. If you like spicy food, this is the place to go for. Recommended Paneer Tikka. In Main course, my favorite is Bhindi Masala. However, the other veg dishes are good as well. There are couple of things with regards to the food which is on a downside - Often the fulkas are not served hot (I think they prepare them and keep it in hot case) and the food has too much oil.  Service: I would rate the service as average. When this branch opened, the service was good. However, with increase in crowd, the service has become little slow. But it is not that bad to prevent you from stepping into this place.  Ambiance: I would rate it good. I think the ambiance was a major factor for me initially because the feel has been of a dhabawhich goes perfectly with delicacies served in this place.  Cost: I think I would rate the food price as pretty reasonable considering the quality of food served here."
4.5,This place is good ..name says. A dhaba ..but a restaurant built in a way of dhaba ambiance ....seating area has cots to sit under the open sky .....food is good both veg and non veg....lassi is must try ....after dinner one can go for pan also if u like ...nice place to go with group and all:)
4.0,This place is worth the hype. One of the few places in Bangalore which is good for both veg and non-veg.   Sweet lassi is worth giving a shot :)
4.5,"Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba is amazing! Food is brilliant, ambience is the best they could have done in the third floor of a building. Only one con I would mention is that the sitting isn't that comfortable. Other than that, everything is good."
3.5,"This dhaba-like restaurant is located on a quiet street of Brookefield yet, it is always bustling with people!  Ambiance: Loud, cheery and a very busy place! The decor is very authentic, the 'charpais', cane stools, stony floors and the dim lights give a very dhaba-ish feel to the place. You enter your way through lanterns and raw walls to a bustling crowd enjoying some north Indian delicacies.  Food: The Malai Kofta is rich and creamy and a treat for those who like a lil-bit-of sweet in everything. Tawa Veg is a mix of many vegetables and some cottage cheese and is fiery spicy. Perfect to go along with butter rotis/naan. The fresh lime soda could be an ideal drink to quench your thirst.  Service: The service is quick and the staff is polite. The food doesn't hurt the pockets! A good go-to place for all the yum Punjabi food cravings. Although the waiting line may be a bummer."
3.5,"We decided to go to this place on a Sunday night. I must say it was a bad decision. Would have been much better if we had chosen to go on a weekday. It was damn crowded. We waited for half n hour on the staircase. Finally when we got the table, it took another half n hour to get the food. One more disappointing thing was the service and the behavior of waiters. They refuse to seat us at the table of our choice. Food was pretty decent and nice. We so wanted to have parathas but sadly they weren't available. Ambience was great. I totally loved the lassi they served. :)  Hope this place does not disappoint me next time! :)"
4.0,"Punjabi flavour! The lassi here. The presentation of some normal starters are also different and nicely done :) Been here quite a few times, the outer seating is better if weather is good.Overall, a decent experience :)"
3.5,Like the place for lot. The ambience as the name says is of a dhaba(80%). The food is above average but not great. Overall a good place to hang out and enjoy..:-D
3.5,"#Desi_Bhukkad  For all the desi people out there,   1. First Food (because in the end that's what matters) Food is amazing here, with almost good north indian waala touch which you find very rare in Bangalore. If you are looking to eat good north Indian food with mast chatpata spicy do visit this place Must eat: Lemon Chicken, Babycorn tikka, Malai kofta, kulhad lassi   2. Service: On weekends it takes up to half hour to get your order but if you are in college and going with friends it won't matter as food and college gossips will make that wait worth it  3. Ambience: its normal with not much space which makes it very noisy specially on weekends. So if you have a good masti waali company even you can shout and contribute. They have  Muddhaas and khaat to sit which are not that comfortable but gives you a different experience  Special tip: On weekends the waiting list will be huge and it might take half to one hour to get a table so try to go there before 8pm"
4.5,"A good restaurant  in AECS Layout really nice and good punjabi food and the lassi is  a must tryout . Not that costly neither not that cheap but is still pocket friendly  Pros:Awesome LASSI , pocket friendly  Cons: As such didnt find any  Cost for 2 :600"
4.5,"Went here for lunch. We had the paneer tikka, plain kulcha, palak kofta and paneer biriyani. Everything was just lip smacking good. The paneer pieces were really soft and the flavours stuck to them very well Although the tikka starter was a bit more on the spicy side, the kofta gravy and paneer biriyani were much more easier on the taste buds. They were also were generous with the quantity of each dish. And to top it all, the prices are extremely reasonable. Definitely a must visit for all lovers of Punjabi food."
4.5,"Food was very good and not that costly. A nice place to visit, decore was very pleasant and in evening it just look wonderfull. Do order gobi paratha, it was very good."
4.0,"One of my friend told about this restaurant. So we visited once. We ordered Veg biriyani, Chicken biriyani, Tandoori roti, Chicken handi and some paneer items. The was good specially biriyani .  I loved the way they have decorated the interiors."
4.0,"We should appreciate the management for the interior, not a very hifi kinds, but delicate and done well. #ChickenTandoori: Well marinated, juicy chicken, we relished and the best part was the mint chutney. Must Order. #ChickenSaawariya:The name excited me to order this, another tandoor item, a little greenish, spicy, taste delicious. #ChickenLollypop:This will take u for surprise, was steaming hot, spicy, and little crunchy. They make 2 version- manchurian & chilly. Very good, do order. #ButterChicken: Was not at all satisfied with this. Was too sweet, more than usual. Too put off this was not boneless. Avoid butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. Nan/roti/kulcha are always good and dreshly made ans cooked well. In all the best restaurant in Brookefield.                                                                 instagram.com"
4.5,"It was a great experience to have a delightful lunch with friends out here. Both varieties i.e., Non-Vegetarian and Vegetarian (I'm reviewing here for Veg Dishes being a Vegetarian). From Shorba's to Manchurian's, from Roti to Khulcha every single dish was spectacular. Good Ambience and Services provided shall make you feel comfortable. I would rate this restaurant a 4/5 and would recommend my friends to visit this restaurant."
4.0,"A desi style dhaba with food served in brass and sitting on a khat, this is a great place for the experience. The food is authentic North Indian, their desi ghee dal tadka is the best pick after the reshmi chicken."
4.0,"Beautiful decor.. Good ambience.. Love their seating arrangement ... Service is good... Food is authentic Punjabi with a huge and creamy glass of lassi... The curries taste good .. Specially the serson Di saag ... Only problem is due to space crunch, the waiting lines are huge. It's always over crowded .. But all in all a good place for lunch or dinner. Advance booking is a must."
3.5,"This place is packed to the skins even on a weekday as it's apparently one of go to places for North Indian food in the vicinity.This place will capture you by its ambiance, emulating a dhaba. However, it didn't manage to live up to the simple expectation I had, which was to satiate my cravings for North Indian food.  You cannot have Punjabi food without ordering Lassi along with it. And they got the Lassi perfect. You can also pay extra to have the Lassi in the clay-pot glasses, which sadly weren't available that day.  The service was good, but you have to wait for at least 15-20 minutes for the food to come to your table and hence, we decided to order the starters and main course together. Gobi Chilly and Masala Papad was a good start to the afternoon but the Paneer Tikka was slightly stale and chewy. The Chilli chicken could have been better too. For the main course, the paneer tikka masala was a wrong choice and Dal Fry was the better option between the two. The rotis were fresh and soft.    So, yes, this is a good place to visit with friends or just to hang with your family for a casual lunch/dinner!"
4.5,"Nice ambiance and yummy food. For starters, we had the in-house special mushroom tikka. The mushrooms were fresh and very tasty.In the main course, the tawa veg is a great option and the veg biryani was very flavorful!Light on your pocket, an excellent option for some authentic north Indian food in brookefield"
4.0,So the authentic punjabi cuisine and ambience that we get in this restaurant is really cool. The food also tastes very good. This should be a must visit restaurant with friends and family.
2.5,"I was super hungry and in a mood to have north Indian and that's when I thought of visiting this place. The place was very crowded and there was 45 mins waiting. After 50 mins we got one table. We immediately ordered Butter Chicken, Dum Aloo, Malai Kofta, Boondi Raita and Butter Rotis. The service was quick and it took 15-20 mins for our food to arrive.   Rotis were cold and we asked them to replace. Dum Aloo was really bad and I have never had such bad Dum Aloo. Malai Kofta and Butter chicken was just decent. Too much salt in Boondi Raita.   Overall the food was below average and considering the kind of waiting time you have to get a table, the place is not at all worth a visit."
4.0,"Nice place. Good food. Rates are very competitive.  Ambiance : Nice place over all. They have given a dhaba like look with mat stools and stables. I felt for tall people it is not that comfortable but it does give the feeling like a dhaba. overall nice. u can sit in open space as well.  4/5  location is also good. its near cosmo mall.  Staff: Overall good service. u will get your orders in time. Staff is there for looking your orders. But need to improve the servicing.   3.5/5  Food: A good place in Brookfiled. The food is good. We ordered baby corn starter and Chicken gravy with kulcha. All the things are good. They don't charge service tax as well;-) ,so the bills are less. Being north indian i felt lassi is just regular one, nothing  to special but people does like it."
4.0,Had a team lunch here. What started as an impromptu lunch plan ended as a well satisfying lunch which was full but not heavy. Probably had more chicken on one day than any other day and the chicken tasted good. The butter rotis weren't served that hot but was good with the curry. And the lassi. Yummy as always.
4.5,Thank you so much for all the weekend lunches :) Absolutely amazing authentic north-indian food. All paneer dishes are mouth-watering. Food- 5/5 Service-4/5
3.5,Good food experience with variety north Indian cuisines.. But I find it little bit expensive.. Love the parathas and paneer combinations..
2.5,"ambience is good. Lassi and buttermilk was good. Other than that we tried naan, kulcha, Briyani, roti, cashew gravy, chicken gravy, chicken starter. Chicken starter is bad, gravy is fine but not upto the mark. Briyani is eat able.  Recommendation : not value for money"
3.5,An elegant place with nice bamboo made seats and village atmosphere roofs and ceilings  Serving makes u remember u r eating at a dhaba apart from that not a dhaba feeling at all no correct pricing with the order  fine dishes can be appreciated finally an okay to go Dhaba
3.5,It's ambience Is fine and food is tasty. We had tandoori chicken which was too good.Most of the chicken items are good. Their service is nice.
3.0,Ambience is good. Just felt that the food could be a little better. Somehow I strongly felt that the lassi was extraordinary and saved the day. Had two lassis :)
4.0,Beautiful ambience on roof top... taste as usually always upto the mark... just loved all the items which I've tasted here as well as JP nagar... place a bit compact though
4.0,Just one line is more than enough for this place : I found north India in Bangalore.... That is all for this place to understand.... been a regular customer here now
3.0,"As the name suggests the place has a dhaba like ambience.  The service is usually delayed as the place is bit crowded always.  Food is good.  Babycorn masala, malai paneer kofta and paneer tikka were good.  Also they provide good lassi :)"
1.0,If you expect any form of hospitality then this is not the place for you good or not.  They made some of my group wait outside until everyone came on the pretext of some stupid rule they have.  This on the grounds of being busy.  Soon they won't be at this rate.    Food is good but a bitter experience otherwise.  Need to get their act together.
4.5,Great food. Excellent and quick service.  Enjoyable dhaba style ambience.  Loved it. Will definitely come back. Parking could be the only challenge.
4.5,"I have been to this place with my team for lunch. It's generally very crowded. You might have to wait for a while before you get table. Service is also on slower side. But, every  thing is compensates when you taste the food.  We ordered ghee dal fry and chicken Angara. I thing m gonna be there regular customer"
4.5,"Very unimpressive board, not easily visible.. I had no idea that this place is a famous eatery until my cousin and I reached the third floor of the building on a Friday night. Crowded is an understatement. People throng this place in huge numbers for the weekend dinners. The guy right outside the door takes down our names and calls us when a table is free. It doesn't take as long as you expect them to, unless you are a large group of people.  It's a roadside dhaba recreated on the third floor of a modern building. It's VERY beautiful at night. The lighting is too good. The terracotta, the bricks, the hurricane lamps hanging on the walls, the open space, the uneven stoned floor, bamboo stools for seating, the brass jug on the table, the stainless steel cutlery make the ambiance so awesome.  Friendly waiters in kurtas welcome you aboard and show you the only empty table. My cousin ordered a Tandoori Chicken Half as a starter. We ordered Tandoori Rotis and Egg Curry. My cousin thoroughly enjoyed the chicken. The Rotis are soft and yum. Egg Curry is damn nice too. I wanted to try out their Masala Soft Drink. Unfortunately they didn't have it that day. So I had Butter Milk which is really nice.  The food is very reasonably priced. Brilliant ambiance. This place is such a feel good dhaba. I would definitely love to go back to this place for dinner."
4.0,"The food is good.. its basically north indian and dhaba style in taste , the way its served and even the seating gives you the feel of being in dhaba in North. The main course is good too but not as much as kababs."
3.0,"Over hyped restaurant. As it fall on a very public place so people don't have much option , always you will find a lot of crowd there. Hard to find vacancy whenever you go. Taste is also not very good. Not recommended."
4.5,"I have always loved the food here. the place is too small because even after having seating capacity of about 45-50 people, this place is usually full. the wait staff are not so accommodating, hence one star less, but the food, the quantity and also the pricing makes this place a complete package!"
4.5,"i went for lunch with my team. We wanted to try a new place. Must tell you this place is just awesome and will give you ""THE DHABA"" feeling. The ambiance is good. Specially the vegetarian foods are finger licking. But I would be more happy if there were more non- vegetarian items apart from chicken like.. fish and mutton. And the price is also very reasonable without any vat charges. Overall very good experience.Finally a satisfying lunch with Lassi and sweet pan."
3.5,"Good north Indian food! and interesting ambience, a place you can visit multiple times!   I tried daal tadka once and daal makhni one other time - both were good. Veggie I ordered was also good. However, buttermilk was quite ordinary; not that I am really complaining - might be a bad day. Service, however, is a tad slow but that's a function of demand - this place is almost full on weekend nights.  Apart from good food, the restaurant has an interesting thing to offer -ambience. This place  makes one feel as if one is dining in a village - mudde and charpai (seats made up of jute and other things). Servers wear kurtas.  This place is not too heavy on the pocket - I'd say a bit more on the pocket friendly side."
4.0,"Had been longing for north indian for quite a time. Wasn't disappointed at all. The food tastes yummy. The seating arrangement is a bit uncomfortable though they have tried giving the proper dhaba feel. But anyway,the food makes it worthwhile. Plus it is pocket friendly. A place worth going again."
4.0,"It is not easy to live up to expectations, once you use the word 'dhaba'. But this restaurant manages to do that so well. The Tandoori items, lassi, phulka and butter gravies, all remind of highway dhabas that we experience once in a while. And yes the ambience and music add more flavor to it."
4.0,"So after hearing from people, went here on a weekend for dinner. After seeing the ambience decided to have dinner outside on a KHAAT table and waited for the it like 1.5 hours. Soon the place became overcrowded with increasing waiting list since the place is only one floor including the kitchen. Food is pretty decent with the quantity that you won't feel is less. They offer the lassi in traditional kulhad style which is a must try and they will charge 10 bucks extra for that.  One of the nicest place to have north indian food as it is all inclusive of taxes.. :)"
4.5,If you want that proper dhaba feeling and plus finger licking food this is the place to go.. A very pocket friendly restaurant with a decent service and  good options for both veg and non veg. Their malai kofta is to die for. Garlic chicken and chicken lollipop are extremely delicious.. Overall an extremely great experience with amazing food.
4.0,"Amazing food. If you are looking for north indian food, make a visit for sure. Veg and non veg both are good, not much variety in starters but main course is good.  Prices are decent as compared to others."
4.0,Wanna get a feel of dhaba in the midst of town? This is the perfect place to dine with family and friends...authentic mouth watering Indian cuisine and the Lassi adds the icing on the cake!! Tanvi Singh Sudeepto Das
4.5,"Since 3 months, I was craving for proper North Indian food and today finally my craving ended with yummy food in this Dhabha. If you are in Banglore and want to have north indian food, you must visit it. Not only the food but the ambience is also nice. Open sitting, lantern hanging on walls and charpai does makes you feel, you are in village. The ambience is perfect for a romantic date. Coming to food, we had ordered butter naan, kadai paneer, dal makhani, paneer biryani and lassi. It wasn't that spicy but indeed it was tasty. Also Quantity is okay according to price.  So I ended my Navratri fast by having dinner here! Their service was nice and we enjoyed alot. :)"
4.0,This place exactly gives a complete look and feel of a dhaba while you sit on a 'khaitya' and waiters serving lassi in those conventional mud made mutkas. The food has typical Punjabi flavour. If you are craving for heavy and spicy food this is the place u should visit.
1.5,Food here had literally spoiled my digestion for 3 days ..i felt it all good when i had ...but later found that they used all the ingredients to mess your appetite ...will never go there again ...
4.5,"A must visit place for every north indian looking out for some authentic north indian food or what we call as theth desi khana! I had masala papad, paneer tikka( which was actually paneer and not tofu), dum alloo kadhai paneer butter roti and kulhad lassi. Everything was finger licking delicious. My ratings goes like this Ambience - 4.5 ( looks like a desi punjabi dhaba at a roof top) Service- 4 ( since we had to wait really long before we could go in and get our tummy stuffed) Most important- food- 5 undoubtedly a winner in bangalore   Guys must visit for having a spicy punjabi flavour food and dont ever miss put the kulhad lassi!  Cheers!"
4.5,"Had been there last night.. Food was just awesome, rates were pretty decent.. I mean you just can't expect it to be cheaper.. Service was prompt even though it was pretty crowded.. Was a little noisy though but that gets compensated with the food that is served.. A must go for those mouth watering dishes.. :)"
4.0,"One of the best places to have Punjabi food. has a good mix of Veg and Non-veg food with great ambience. Tough to notice the restaurant which is tucked away on the top floor of a simple building in Kundanahalli, it sure becomes tough to resist once you taste the food."
4.0,"This is one of the top Punjabi restaurant in that particular area. They have really good Alu Parathas, their Side dishes and starters are good as well. This place has a very good ambiance and service is really top class. Must visit. Have been to this place a lot of times."
4.0,This place provides us with authentic North Indian food. Love the jaljeera here and the food was good. The ambience was good . The cots in dhabha style made me feel different
4.5,"Out of the food we ordered, stuffed mushroom tikka and stuffed kulcha was amazing. You surely can't miss the kulhad lassi which I found at almost every table when I visited. We had ordered a paneer tikka masala which I felt was good but not very great. Coming to the setup of the place -it resembles to a dhaba. It is extremely difficult to find a table if you happen to visit the place during the peak hours.  Please note : the lassi served has a tinge of elaichi."
4.5,Really a Punjabi style restaurant. The food is also very tasty.I Have to talk about the lassi first which simply amazing. The places serves good north Indian food. We tried the typical dal paneer combo and it was good. The ambience is also very punjabi and has a different feel. Good place to visit.
4.0,"good place and good food at a reasonable rates. service is prompt which is always good to have. Long queues on the weekend is a bit of a turn off, but well that might just turn out to be a compliment in disguise! Keep up the quality!"
4.0,"Went on Sunday lunch. There was 15 mins waiting. Trying lassi here is a must. We had paneer tikka masala, phulka and naan and we liked it. Seating is not so comfortable. Overall good Punjabi restaurant ."
4.0,"Ambiance was truly nice. Quantity was really good. Easy on pockets as well. Typical Punjabi taste in the food served. Lassi, Chicken Handi, Methi chicken was really nice.But long long queue. Anyways worth the wait !"
4.0,Went for a team lunch here. Its a bit hard to find but should say I was pleasantly surprised. The ambience is rustic and quite nice. The food though was really good. Its good punjabi fare and I would recommend the lassi and kalmi kabab...ranks among the best I've had in Bangalore. Its not too heavy on the pocket too. Definitely worth a try if you are in this part of the town.
4.0,"The ambience is good to hangout with pals and enjoy punjabi meal on ""manjhi"" or jute made beds.  Service is bit slow as the crowd increases during dinner.  Yes, an authentic punjabi food in the heart of whitefield."
4.0,"Been here twice. Food is amazing. Lassi in kulhad is the best. You can sit on KHATIYA and have food like i used to have at jome. Reasonable price. Ambience is very good. If you go on weekend dinner, place will be very crowded and you have to wait for 15-20 minutes. But worth waiting :)"
4.0,Loved this place. Highly recommended. Slightly expensive but ask for the open air seating on the KHATIYA. Really reminded me of my village. Must pay a visit to this place.  Food Quality : 4/5 Ambience : 4.5/5 Value for Money : 3.5/5 Service : 4/5
3.5,"We came here for team lunch. It is located on the top floor of the same building of Jade and Kayal. We ordered some kebabs and chicken gravy from the menu. I don't remember the dishes. Sorry that I am writing it after a long time since I have been to the place. But, o remember that the for was good and yummy. Nice rooftop seating with a north Indian dhaba experience. I would go here again for some yummy north Indian cuisine."
3.5,we had been here for a team lunch on a friday... we were early to get a seat for 6. the ambiance is very good... and food was very good and tasty... economical as well.. a good place for informal team lunch.. parking is not avaible.. late comers need to wait.
4.0,"Been to this place multiple times for dinner and lunch. Good north Indian food with very rustic ambiance..The staff is all dressed up in kurtas adding to the dhabawaala feel and they have lower sitting arrangement with small wooden stools.. The food is good ..especially non veg..The kebabs and curries are very tasty, which gives an overall satisfying experience food - 4/5 Ambiance - 4/5 service - 4/5"
4.0,Amazing place for that home like food. Amazing pulkas .oh so soft and full of ghee. Best place for simple tummy filling food which will leave you finger licking.
4.0,Chulha Chauki da Dhaba was first suggested by a friend for its yummy Butter chicken and it was 100% true  Their ambience was very different. They had tape cots and modas for seating which added class! The waiters are all dressed in kurtas which brings in the ethnic feel.  Its pretty famous and hence crowded. Its better to make reservations although sometimes they do not accept reservations..  For starters we had the paneer tikka which was very tasty! Our main course was naan and butter chicken which really needs a special mention. Their lassi and chaas are a must try!  Their quantity is quite high and the waiters also warn you about it when you are ordering which was good as it prevents good food getting wasted.  Prices were nominal. Its value for money and is also open till late. The restaurant was quite busy even at 10 in the night.  Overall its a very good choice for punjabi food
3.5,"Went there with friends, totally 6 of us.  Good things: Tasty food. Ordered Veg and Non-veg dishes, both were equally good. Fairly quick service. Economical.  Things to Improve: Seating arrangement is not comfortable for all. Needs big improvement."
4.0,"Whether it's Brookfield or JP Nagar, you should visit Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba at least once. Good place for veggies. Dal tadka, BPM, Kofta etc. Curries give you same taste as North India. Do try paan after having food. I didn't like lassi though but that's OK. Only problem is as there is little space you need to make advance booking especially on weekends."
2.5,"Heard this place serves great north Indian food so one day I visited this place, ordered chicken biriyani and onion parathas. Chicken biriyani was good, different from hyderabadi biriyani n better than that.. Onion parathas was also good n soft. Coming to the ambience - really really uncomfortable to sit, some of my friends don't like to visit here coz of the very highly uncomfortable seating arrangements, though it appears to be a different idea (the Dhaba style) it's not practical to sit n have food in those chairs. Seriously make some changes in it management!"
3.5,"Went to this place on Saturday night ...first of all there was already queue. After 20 minutes got a table. Looks  like a proper dhaba on roof top. In starters we ordered chicken lollipop and mushrooms. A bit spicy but taste was good. Quantity w.r.t. price was OK. In main course we ordered paneer and mix veg type dish and that was average. Fresh lime was served in desi style in a steel glass. Due to rush service was slow but you can avoid that par. Overall, If you are spicy food lover, you should try out this place once."
3.5,"Went to this place recently. It was friday night and as expected we had to wait for 20 min. Food served was good.Only thing which is not comforting is the seating arrangement.There is no leg space and we were finding it hard to sit comfortably. Chicken tandoori was really tasty. Chicken pieces were soft and juicy. We ordered tandori roti and it as bit dry for us. Size of tabdoori rotis are bigger compared to other hotels. It would be good if you order less than  your usual apetite.  I ordered sweet lassi, I didnt like it much since it was rose flavoured. But it was thick and people who like rose flavoured lassi will love it.Dont forget to eat pan..it was really yummy and worth to finish the meal. Serving done was very fast and people are very nice .Even the guard at the entrace made sure that all people are given attention and how waiting time can be reduced. Cost for 2 with usual order would be around 700. A worth visit with friends and family."
3.0,"We visited this place after seeing the reviews on zomato. The was of good quality. We read some names of dishes which we thought was funny...like sawariya chicken, which i must say was quite tasty  the ambience is somewhat like that of a dhaba. Initially thought of giving this place 3.5 stars but then we spotted a rat around the dining area. So ill go with 3 stars."
4.0,"It seems the food has authentic punjabi taste..You'll love the food a lot also it doesn't cost much. Dinner for 4 can be in 1200 with starter, main course and drink. Better to reserve in advance, as in weekend this gets crowded. The ambiance and staff were also nice.."
3.5,"Chulha Chauki da Dhaba first came up in Jp Nagar , where it had a simple blackboard menu but still the yummiest food . I have been a regular to either of these restaurants and can definitely say the popularity of the restaurant has been rising since then .  Located at the top most floor the restaurant is nice , but the restaurant is so crowded or over filled I would like to say that it just kills the ambiance .On weekends it can take up-to 45 minutes to get a table . I always wanted to dine on the cots which overlooks the sky but never have been over a year could ever find a place there .  The food in all is good , but the consistency differs every time . The food wont disappoint but the service and wait time will definitely.  My usual favorite from the vegetarian section is the Malai Kofta and Veg kofta , but even the methi malai matar is good. The starters like paneer tikka and Manchurian are pretty well too. From the non vegetarian section , the chicken lahori and afghani are delicious as suggested by my friends .  The nan and rotis are good , even the biryani both veg and non veg . The lassi served in large steel tumblers is liked by many .  This place cannot be termed as a restaurant serving value for money food because the quantity of food varies many a times .Not much to be expected out of the service too,  The food is more about comfort and the familiarity of flavors , that reminds many of us about the food back in many parts of Northern India . Kudos to the owner for this !"
3.5,"Ever drove in the highways of Punjab? No? The dhabas over there.. A sheer bliss! Well this is on of the dhabas in disguise! Rooftop! Probably nice time is dinner and family! The food is okay with way too much spices but the lassi, dude! it will surely give you chills!"
2.5,"Having been to their JP Nagar outlet, had big expectations - but unfortunately this is just like any other North Indian restaurant. The seating looks good but is uncomfortable, space is cramped, food is at best okay. Nothing to brag about the food. The service isn't up to standards. The Tandoori Chicken is their best item on the menu from whatever I tried. Food is very heavy though. Has decent Veg food (a rarity)."
3.5,"Following this restaurant since the day it is opened. When we ordered initially or for the first time all we got Garam Masala in a heavy quantity in all the dishes, so we stopped having food from there. But lately I thought of giving a try again and this time I was not disappointed. They did improve a lot, we had palak paneer and methi chicken which was really specifically Palak Paneer. Later on visited the place again as Dine-in and they do have a Dhaba style ambiance which is kinda different in a restaurant since it is on 4th Floor. But yeah, the last home delivery order had a bit more of Garam Masala in Kadhai Mushroom and rest was good whatever we ordered. Personally my fav is Palak Paneer and Methi chicken."
3.5,"Been here a few times and this is definitely a keeper for ""punjabi food"" with minimum frills.The seating is simple moodas in an attempt to create the dhaba effect. May not work for all as you have to lean forward to eat.  Have had chicken makhanwallah, chicken lahsuni, tandoori chicken, lassi and few more items in various visits. Fairly decent food- meaning, it is the onion paste gravy which goes well with roti kind of food. But that is what will expect from such a place.  Menu does not have any mutton dishes. And, while I have enjoyed the food, my search for good tandoori chicken will continue.  Go again: surely.  One thing I hope they fix: the entrance to the building and lift area is always smelling of dirty mop."
3.5,Place is nice for one time. All starters tastes almost same. Ambience is good. Too much waiting time..Spicy food lovers can go there without thinking..
3.5,"We loved this dhaba place, in fact this is one of the very good panjabi joint in whole whitefield area. the sitting ambiance is very traditional, parathas are good, chicken is nice...pick time , need to wait for 30 mins min, don't order biriyani"
3.5,Ambience is great but it has too much rush in weekends.food is good.we ordered 4 curry and lassi. Everything was good.but bread was not good. overall a good place to go with friends amd family.
3.5,"Loved the seating arrangement on the roof top.. The khaat and muddas, the stones on the ground, the music from late 80s and early 90s created the real dhaba ambience!! We ordered: 1. masala papad - super spicy but nice 2. Fresh lime soda - great taste 3. Lassi - it was super thick and yummy.. Would prefer the salted one over the sweet one though 4. CCDD Special Starter - this was really really good!!! 5. Malai Kofta - Decent but very small quantity 6. Paneer Tikka Masala - Extremely spicy, very nice .. Again limited quantity 7. Phulkas - these were nice and soft and home-like 8. Garlic naan - very hard, but taste was fine 9. Kulcha - it was nothing like a kulcha ... Was more like the naan only (disappointing)  All in all, a decent place for Sunday afternoon lunch."
4.0,One of the very few good resturants in Brookefield. I personally prefer veg to Non Veg here.good service and neat place. Ask for the roof top reservation before going.Almost all the veg items are good. Food is little spicy yet tasty. You shouldn't leave place without having their Lassi. Manoj Parida Vivek H. Singh Indian
4.0,One of the best flavours of North Indian dishes. Butter chicken and malai kofta were way too sweet. Some dishes are unbearably spicy. One of the best Tandoori chickens we had so far in Bangalore. Good joint for the spicy food lovers.
4.5,Awesome taste and ambience :) really love this place :) It says dhaba so u wont get to taste soup here but other than that starters and gravies are awesome.  Although seats are bit uncomfortable but we forget everything while having some really tasty food. Really spicy and tasty north Indian food. Lassi at the end is a must try here!
4.5,Mainly have to talk about the ambience and the setup. Really a Punjabi style restaurant. The food is also very tasty. Have to talk about lassi which simply amazing. Bit costly but have to experience once. The service is also good but bit uncomfortable to sit in carts and small chairs. Overall a good one.
4.0,"The places serves good north Indian food. We tried the typical dal paneer combo and it was good. The ambience is also decent, with a dhaba feel to it. Recommends if good north Indian food is what you're looking for."
4.5,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Brookefield. The rotis, kulchas and curries here are really delicious. If you want to have North Indian food, then definitely try this out. It will be really crowded during weekends so be ready to wait for a while. This is the topmost floor of a building and they have some open terrace area.They have few cots i here instead of the normal tables in restaurants. It would be a different experience to dine there."
2.0,I had rated this place 5 earlier...but I ordered for home delivery and was disappointed...you have the menu saying free home delivery in 3km radius with no minimum bill...but you refuse to accept the order billing Rs.450+ when the delivery has to be done in less than 2km radius...either you need to update your menu or mention what do you mean by 3km n also mention minimum amount of bill if any...the order was accepted after literally fighting and arguing with you!!! The order was confirmed to be delivered in 40 mins but was only delivered after 3 calls and after 1.5 hrs after we ordered the food....
4.5,"Love the ambience here , especially when you get the place on char Pai. The food here is really good and do try Lassi  here. Overall a very nice place and is good for both veg and non veg."
4.0,"This place is good specially when you see the open roofs.food is good.I particularly like the lassi,tastes delicious. Service time quite normal,its just that the place remains crowded everytime."
3.5,"After reading through scores of reviews and the hype created about this place, I was pretty excited to visit this place.  They do not accept prior reservations and you have to be there get your name registered and probably stand in front of their door, because apparently they are too busy to note down your phone numbers and inform you once a table is available for you.  The guy who guides you trough the door also acts like a total retard. Hospitality is one thing you need not except here. The dining chairs available are worse than of a real dhaba. Dining table is itself knee length and not wide enough. We had to keep the water jugs and glasses on the floor, because there was no space left after our food had come.  Do not expect a quality service, rather it just seems like a darshini where you leave the table as soon as you are done.  But all is not that bad. The food seems delicious and the best part is they will get all your order at once. Well that's the only good thing I experienced in my visit.  Not worth the hype, a big ZERO for their customer service & hospitality."
3.5,The food is just awesome and you can guess its popularity by the queue they have all the time. But its worth waiting. Good service. All the dishes are awesome.. Don't forget to take a lassi in the beginning and pan at the end.
4.0,"Totally brings out the PUNJABI inside you!! If you have lived in Punjab, this is the place you can visit to relive your memories. We visited for a weekend lunch and everything was perfect. Even with so many people there, the service was quite quick. Nice place, nice food !!"
4.0,Best place of Punjabi food. crowded a lot during weekends. waiting time is long with big Que. food quality is good and good variety too. Their Lassi stands out in the menu and go for it. briyani and other dishes was also good. Ambiance is quiet dark and the seats are very small. Good service and presentation of food. Will recommend for sure.
3.0,"Have been to this restaurant twice and it failed to impress me. The ambience is quite dull although they tried hard to make it theme based by trying to create a dhaba style atmosphere. Another experience that was not so positive is the amount of time you end up waiting here. Be ready to wait to enter the dining hall and once you enter inside, most likely you will end up getting a cramped sitting space.  Then there was a lot of delay in getting the food on the table.  The food was just ok.  The menu is another me too menu. Nothing to boast about the food.  The experience about food and service second time was almost the same however,  we had managed to get a decent seating place this time."
4.0,"One of the few places which serve authentic Punjabi food and that too hot!! Dal makhni is arguably the best in Bangalore...They make sure you dont order excess and waste....  Seating could be a bit more comfortable, and please keep your clay Kulhad stock intact for Lassi... Steel glass is a turn down :)"
2.0,"A must try for non-vegetarians, boring ambiance, roof top is just nominal. Curry is extraordinarily spicy gives you mouth burns. Try at your own risk!"
2.5,"The ambience is good but the sitting arrangement is a little uncomfortable.  We ordered a gobi chilly, chicken tikka, veg kolhapuri, paneer tikka masala, tandoori chicken, chicken biryani and kulhad lassi. In breads, we ordered garlic naan, plain naan, butter roti, plain roti. The garlic naan and butter roti were conveniently replaced by plain naan and plain roti. Coming to the starters, the chicken starter was good but the gobi chilly was so spicy that you could taste raw green chilly. Same with all the curries. Extremely spicy. So couldn't figure out the taste. The biryani was decent. Little dry and very spicy again. The lassi was yummy, a little too sweet for my taste but my friends liked it. The quantity is less. The service is excellent. Would like to give this place one more chance.      As I said before, I gave this place one more chance. And I was surprised. We ordered a baby corn tikka, paneer mushroom and butter naan, tandoori roti. The starter was boring but not bad, had almost as many tomatoes as baby corn. The curry was delicious, soft paneer and fresh, soft mushrooms. The gravy was not overtly spicy. The breads were not rubber like, even after they got cold. I would give it a 0.5 more for that experience. Overall rating: 3"
3.5,Punjabi food is good...I want to give 4...but I deduct 0.5 for seating arrangement... Not too much comfortable... Still food quality and service is good.
4.5,"Excellent food.. Ambience as well is nice. Service was really good and quick. Try butter plain paratha, you'll love it. I felt like eating Punjabi directly from Punjab. Tandoor paneer tikka is mouth watering.."
3.0,I feel that this place is overrated. Went on a Sunday evening. I had to wait for 45 minutes. The crowd was just thronging to this place. The restaurant has a village setup with stools and cots made of rope. They take 20 minutes to bring the food.  The lassi was very thick and tasty. Chicken tikka was very good. The roti and kadai chicken curry was just good enough. Nothing out of the world. The cost of the curry was 250 bucks for a small cup with hardly 4 small sized boneless pieces. This wasn't enough for  2 of us. The restaurant needs to increase the size of the portions.
3.0,26th July: Okay. A village type setup. With cane chairs and cots to sit.  Had heard a lot about this place before visiting but this place didnt really live upto the expectation.  On a weekend it took us 40 mins to get the table.  it was already past dinner time.   On getting the table it took the waiter 17 minutes and 3 reminders to serve water.  We ordered Manchurian for starters. Paneer tikka and Ghee phulka for main and Lassi.  Manchurian was decent.  Paneer tikka was okay. Lassi was Average.  The waiters dont serve here. so you have to help yourself. This annoyed me.  I felt like i had gone to one of those free food joints from various religious trusts.  The repeat phulka took 10 mins to arrive after ordering.  We ordered biryani in the end. The waiter(after 10 mins of order) came back to us and said that the biryani is not available.  we than settled down to fried rice as pulav wasnt available too.  The waiters were very rude.  The put the bill on the table even without confirming if we are done.  Below is my rating:  Ambiance: 4/5  Quality: 3/5  Quantity: 3/5  Service: 2/5  Worth a visit: No.  Value for money: 2/5
5.0,"Amazing ambience, prompt service, impeccable taste and affordable rates. That's the true summary for this restaurant. This is easily one of my favorite places in Bangalore and I often keep forcing my friends to go there every time we are eating out. I have been to this place for more than 20 times and still love it a lot. The food is delicious, beautiful and exquisite. The service is as prompt as you can expect and you get all of this at rates you wouldn't imagine. The dhaba like ambience just adds on to the experience. Do check out this place."
1.0,"One word summaries this place  Pathetic!!!! First of all kindly change your timings on zomato...Restraunt is not open till 4 PM. I arrived here at 3.32 an was rudely said that it is closed. Guard feels as if he owns the restraunt. I came here after having good experience at JP Nagar but this one turned out very bad. Earlier also I had ordered food from here, and it was of very low quality. I thought that it was a one of incident and let that slide, but after today's experience I can easily say that it is one of the WORST places in Bangalore.  Guys avoid it all cost."
4.0,"Two things that justifies the name is their prompt service & manufactured ambience. They did a pretty decent job disguising the rooftop as a dhaba. Priced moderately expensive, they have rich variety of veg and non veg dishes. Gravies are rich & creamy. Anything from tandoor comes well prepared and spicy. A big Sweet lassi/butter milk compliments the meal perfectly. Seating is predominantly lower & without back rest, so could prove inconvenient to few but again gives you the exact flavor of a dhaba. Had a great time. #NorthIndian #Tandoor #EveningPlace"
1.0,Complete Avoid ... Looks like some andhra chef trying his hands at punjabi food. Never had such a spicy tandoori chicken. Not sure what the fuss is all about this place. They will learn the hard way that it is not about ambience
3.5,"Visited the Brookefield outlet for lunch with friends. The decor and ambiance resembles the other outlets. Service is quick and better compared to the one located in Kalyan Nagar.  The food is quite tasty and somewhere it has that north Indian flavour, no doubt. I would recommend Paneer tikka masala here. Though other dishes were okayish.  This place is good if you want to have good north Indian food without spending too much money on it."
4.0,Ordered Butter chicken boneless which was amazing. Veg Kadhai was good and the chapatis were fine. Delivery time was pretty good (30mins). Chicken Handi was on the spicy side but a good dish.
4.5,Been there several times and this place never cease to amaze me. Eating while sitting on a khatiya is an experience my childhood relates to. Food is mouth watering and staff is courteous. Easy on pocket and Heavy on taste buds I would say.
3.5,This is a no frills dhaba. The food is tasty and affordable. Just the right amount of richness for punjabi food. Few of the non-veg dishes are priced way more than expected for a joint of this mileu. But would still go for decent punjabi food.
2.5,"Went here after reading a few reviews..  Must say, CCDD did not live up to the name. We ordered food and finished two glasses of water by the time it was served. Very slow service. Our hunger had died by then and needless to say we didn't quite enjoy the food that much.. Taste-wise also there's nothing great.."
3.5,Been here yesterday... It was very crowded but the service fast... Food : decent and the price was fine.. We ordered tandoori chicken which was ok.
4.0,"Had dinner at chulha chauki few days back. Heard some good reviews about this place so gave it a try.  Ambiance - Interiors of this place is very dhabha like. They have done a good job with it and have very dhabha style seating arrangement with manjis (that bed sort of thing) and stools. Although the place is but small.  Food - Food is very tasty and have authentic north Indian flavours. We ordered sawariya chicken, ccdd mushroom, dal makhani, Punjabi masala chicken and paneer tikka masala. Everything was good, sawariya chicken is but spicy (so beware while ordering it)  dal makhani was great.  We also had kulhad lassi , which was again very good.  Service - Staff is professional and had good understanding of their menu and helped us to place an  order according to our taste. Service was also quick.  Very authentic tasting food. Will be visiting again."
3.5,I visited there yesterday with my friends. I loved their dhaba style ambiance with seating and the pocket friendly prices. They mainly offering  north Indian cuisines which are better than any other restaurants in Bangalore. Cleanliness was maintained throughout. I ordered for dal tadka .It was well prepared with desi ghee.Chicken keema was also delicious .Whatever i tasted was good and warm. Definitely can be visited a number of times with family and friends. The service was a bit slow. But it doesn't matter because the food is worth for the wait.
3.0,The food was okay... It tasted good but was very oily and heavy... The ambience is top notch ; service is good but could be better.. The biggest problem though is with the exorbitant prices : it is extremely overpriced for what it is... But then again there are few north Indian places in bangalore which offer decent food at decent prices so you can give this a try...
4.5,"Be here to experience the Dhaba itself! Its right out of the Punjab highways!! Food is great & spicy..and the best part is the variety of food you get! Had a wonderful time..loved their naans , biriyani, chikn 65 and much more! Oh, don't forget the biiiig glass of lassi to round it up..malai maar ke!"
3.0,"Good for dinner with friends .. Not the place to visit if ur looking for a peaceful meal .. Super crowded on weekends. Better to order rather than visiting. Please give prior instructions to keep the food less spicy. The dhaba set up is very interesting , however gets a little cramped. Value for money !!"
5.0,Sunday lunch dhaba style... what more to ask... Staff were courteous as usual and the service was excellent... Recommend with my eyes closed if you are up for a awesome food... :)
3.5,Want decent north indian food.. look nowhere else.. atleast for whitefield residents..obviously it isnt as great as north indian dhabas.. but I found it better than most others in Blore..
3.5,"A decent place to dine in with a perfect ambience and a good food. Afghani kabab, garlic chicken, dal tadka and lassi are my personal favorite of this place. Price is relatively ok.The only thing I don't like about this place is the waiting time both while getting a seat and the serving time of the dish."
4.0,"I have been to this place thrice now. All the waiters are dressed in khadi kurtas. They even have a small dhaba section complete with 'khatiyas' with the flooring of pebbles. The rustic setting is complemented with some good food. They mainly offer north Indian dishes and they are good at it. All the different kinds of curries that I have tried were well prepared. The lassi demands a special mention. You can even go 1/2 on the lassi if you are already full. The only thing is the place felt a little pricier than what I expected. And, its almost always full!"
4.0,"A fine dining experience in a pure native ambiance. The cot and rope-woven chairs gives a rugged feel of being in a dhaba. The yummilicious foods taste as if came direct from an UP kitchen...! Would the staff speaking in Hindi, it would have been just like eating in an village of northern part of India."
3.0,"Quite near to my office ...so usual place for office parties celebrations, Friday lunch outing etc. ...luv the dhaba style  seating.....have seen and heard lots of good reviews about the food here...but honestly d food is just lyk any average restaurant in Brookfield area.....kebabs are worth to try and the lassi in kulhads is a delight..... But the most disaapointing thing bout the place is the service...I have been derr in groups both large and small ....but everytym we have waited for at least 45 mins to get the food delivered to our tables.....and even the ventilation is pretty poor....once it gets crowded ...the entire place turns up into a hot oven which I disliked the most....they should improve on the service and ventilation infra. Overall its an indifferent dhaba style food joint in Brookefield area                                                                 fudvoyage.wordpress.com"
4.0,Nice place with authentic dhaba style seating..Went this place for a Friday night dinner. Food was awesome so the drinks were..Crowded place but will get a table in 15 20 mins. .worth waiting..They have only 3 tables open roof.. it would have been great if they increase their seating capacity open roof. .
4.5,"I see many people rating this place so low, I am a personal fan of the place. Had a lovely brunch. Food tasted great. We ordered chicken tikka , dal tadka and paneer biryani. Dal tadka was very delicious. Trust me you'll end up taking the stairs."
3.0,"Been here few weeks back.. Ambience will give you a feel of dhaba.. Too much crwod on weekends.. Had to wait 15 mins to get a table for two...  We ordered punjabi chicken and butter rotis.. Rotis were hard and clearly telling that they have been made sometime back.. So out of 4 butter rotis, I returned 2 as they were not hot.. Coming to punjabi chicken.. They heated up in microwave and served us after garnishing with green chillies.. It was too spicy but we liked it somehow.. There were only 4 small pieces of chicken.. :(  Overall it's costly with decent taste.."
3.0,"After hearing rave review about this restaurant . I decided to dine here(first wrong decision ), ordered their tandoori chicken (second wrong decision), the chicken had more red colour than the red fort(still trying to remove the food coloring) the taste was decent but not rave worthy. The rotis(Indian Bread) were not cooked to my satisfaction but the chicken adraki was good. The restaurant is definitely not worth the hype. I am still rating it a generous 3 for their ambience and chicken adraki."
4.5,Must visit place for tasty tandoori and kebabs.. Awesome dhaba ambience and the sweet lassis are to die for.. Will definitely recommendation
3.5,"Well let's break it down categorically.  Ambiance: 4/5 The place offers nice punjabi dhaba feel which is comfortable and enjoyable. I personally liked the open area arrangement with cot.  Food: 3.5/5 We ordered  Starters: Chicken Tikka Tandoori Kabab Chilly Lollypop chicken Haryali kabab  The chicken was properly cooked, the kind of good that stay in mouth for right amount of time and easy to swallow. no extra chewing no improper taste .The garnishing was decent, the extras like chutney and lemons were stingily added.  If you like spicy food go for Chilly lollypop chiken and chiken tikka.  Main Course: Chicken tikka masala Chicken Khadai Paneer butter masalaNaan Tandoori roti  Paneer was good and must try for vegetarians :). Chicken Khadai was smooth and curry was just fine. Naan wasn't that great.  Hospitality: 1.5/5 The place might give good food but they definitely lack good waiter and behavioral aspects. They lack serving etiquette, also will keep standing on your head trying to get you out of place, to make space for rest. you can't enjoy at the place as they try to push you with finishing the food by constantly asking for clearing of table even while food is there. Everytime time I visited the place this remained the same, so i am no longer their customer or order online :P"
3.5,"Refreshing Dhaba experience in AECS Layout. This is one place I prefer to come multiple times. Love the ambience. Food is good too, though it can get really spicy at times.   Visited for a Saturday afternoon lunch with family and I should say we all thoroughly enjoyed it.   Staff was Very friendly and polite guys who ensure you get the best experience. They helped us choose non spicy dishes which kids could also eat.   Masala papad was lil spicy but tasty.  Malai paneer tikka was awesome. Paneer was very fresh....  For the main course we tried Dal Makhani, veg malai kofta , garlic naan, tandoori roti  Garlic naan was not that good. Kofta curry was tasty.  Dal Makhani was fine but not the best one I ate. It was more of Dal and less Makhani.   One must definitely try the paan. It's served with a rose petal making it look good and taste is yummy too."
4.0,1 visit is enough for the memory of a lifetime..  From kebabs.. To roti and chicken and paneer.. And the finishing touch of the paan.. Wow... You will love it..  Always prefer for the khatia outside which makes ur dhaba experience complete...  Ambiance will make u fall in love with it..
3.5,"I have been waiting to go to this place for a long time now and the wait was worth it. The ambience of this place reminds you of a typical dhaba. Small muddas and small tables make up for a casual seating experience. This place is not classy or royally appealing but the food makes up for everything.  We started with fresh lime sodas which was decent but the chilli paneer was awesome. Perfectly cooked and spicy. The seekh kabab was not very great but they were soft so it was edible. The main course was good - though they can work on their breads a bit. The vegetables were good but the breads weren't very appealing. This place is very light on the pocket. I am definitely trying this place again when I feel like hogging good food. Oh and yes this place is very crowded, usually a waiting for a couple of minutes and they do not reserve seats over the phone."
3.5,Awesome food... Make sure u sit in the open area to get the real pinch of a dhaba.. Don't miss out the corn peas masala :D The only issue is with the sitting arrangements.. the chair they provide for the sitting doesn't allow to have a comfortable dine and there is a good amount of waiting time to get a table(mostly on weekends) so do reach half an hour before time....
4.0,"I took my brother to this place as he was looking for some good authentic punjabi food. We started with Chicken tikka. Although it was marinated well and the amount of spices on it were good too, the chicken itself was little hard to my liking. We had masala pappad which was good as pappad was baked instead of being fried. In main course we had Chicken Lasooni which unlike other places tasted differently from Chicken butter masala or Chicken tikka masala. It was little oily but I guess good taste surpasses the issue. The best part was a salty Lassi we ordered. In bangalore I am usually afraid to order salty lassi as generally the Curd sour which spoils the lassi taste badly. But here the lassi was awesome. It had the right mix of jeera masala and salt.  For us service was also pretty quick and we were in and out of the place in 1 hour or so."
3.5,Really rooftop experience is awesome. Items taste is good. I am there with my wife. She came across this place name from her friend. Really it's a good place. Environment is good but taste wise u can find anywhere not that much special.
3.0,If you are looking for north Indian dhaba food.. It's a place in the heart of whitefield..   Food is okies.. Value for money.. Although high in oil.. The menu is extensive..you will find good variety in all course of meal.  Ambience is basic.. With khatiyas with wooden planks as tables.. Mudhas for comfortable seating.. Has full rustic feel with brass jugs..kulhad for serving chaas  Staff is attentive.. And very quick in service. Even reorder is fast.  Reservation is highly recommended..
4.5,"I've been to this place 3 times and I'm still amazed by how cheap this place is. It is a perfect example for bang for buck. The place is a bit difficult to spot if you don't have maps. They have a nice dhaba setup with hindi songs playing in the background. The ambience is delightful especially the khatia seating. The management is quite polite., the waiters wear kurtas and they serve water in a copper jug. Its pretty crowded at times and they do not take reservations. So I had to wait for around 40 minutes on my second visit. I really liked their chicken tikka masala. It's quite spicy just the way I like it. Their masala kulcha, lassi and lime soda are also good. Definitely recommended if you want to eat out without burning a hole in your wallet."
3.5,"The taste isn't really great as their definition of spicy is underplayed.   The moment you enter, there is a sense of warmth with which they welcome you and note down your name if there is waiting.   The paratha, roti kulcha are authentic Punjabi. Don't forget to try the matka kulfi. Not better than the lassi bar in jayanagar but can be had once because of the matka."
4.5,"A must place to visit for a foodie.. Nice place setup village style, The food and the ambiance gives you dhaba feeling.  Food quality and quantity is to the mark and very economical."
4.5,"I've been to this place quite a few times. This is very good ""dhaba"" in brookefield. You go here anytime and they will never disappoint you! Quality and taste is maintained throughout. Service may take long sometimes. But still it's worth it. If you stay in nearby area or roaming around this area then this is the best place to have lunch/dinner."
4.0,"Are you looking for aa dhaba somewhere in bangalore then i think your search ends here. The ambience of the place is like a typical dhaba with khaat and patri for food. You should definitely try the lassi there. The food was good but the quantity was really less. But overall, the visit is worth time and money."
4.0,Food dhaba ambience. They serve quick. Have tried different chicken dishes on every visit. They ask have been good. Place for authentic north in indian food around Whitefield.
1.5,"OK, I have been a fan of this place before today. The food tasted good though it took a bit time. Last night after waiting outside for 45 mins we placed the order. After 35 mins the food came. A table who came after, got the food before us and were almost done. at 10.40 we finally indulged in the food. The butter chicken tasted different from the usual. The spices were not correct. We thought its still fine, they cant make the food tasting same every time. Today me and my friend both have diarrhea. Seriously??...what the hell!!. WE are not coming back here ever again."
4.0,"A good north indian restaurant with good north indian dishes both veg and non veg , A nice rooftop place , Loved the lassi over there , A good place which deserves a 4 rating in that locality"
4.0,"A Great ambience, quality food and worth the money. We just ordered vegetarian and found it to be sumptuos. Food was a bit spicy but loved the Punjabi flavour."
3.0,"One of the near by restaurants, have ordered multiple times, dine in as well. Mostly dishes are OK - veggies can try panner biryani & mushroom biryani."
4.0,"We were there for lunch right after the movie 'Piku', it was a treat :) . As per the restraunt it is desi and I love it! It lives up to it's name with all wooden chairs and khatiya, copper water jugs and waiters in traditional punjabi kurta. You can choose to sit outside or inside. We ordered chicken tikka and some paneer item and, chicken punjabi masala with kulcha for main course. Overall food is upto the mark. Their lassie is superb, served in tumbler made of clay(kulhad) .  I would suggest going to this place atleast once."
5.0,"Visited this place just last evening, it probably has some of the best North Indian fare in Bangalore. I had tava chiken and garlic butter naan, mouth watering, satiating ...Call book, register when you're there , wait and enjoy."
4.0,"Two things which magnetised me to hop in here for a dine, they were Punjabi style food and dhaba ambience. I had non veg items and Indian breads. I will be providing info in nutshell without eating up your precious time :)  Pros: Nice location, can easily be found. If you have google map, then use it. Nice ambience, a bit congested but its manageable. Awesome Non Veg food. In starters I tried Sawariya Chicken (you just can't afford to miss it), lemon Chicken and Chilli Pepper. All were mouth watering and were well cooked. In main course, I had Chicken Punjabi Masala and Chicken Lahsuni. Both were up to the mark. Well prepared Jaljeera. Very economical. 3 persons I paid 1200. Friendly staff.  Cons: Pathetic Indian breads, I ordered phulka and tandori roti. They were cold, so it was clear it wasn't freshly made. the phulka was not of complete wheat but was having maida too. I was really disappointed with that. It's my main reason for not giving 5 rating.  P.S. Waiting time is a bit prolonged. Make sure after registering your name for the queue, you remain at the entrance as the security guard will tell you it will take 45 minutes but your name will come in 20 minutes and if you aren't available you will lose your queue number."
5.0,"It's the name that comes to my mind when I think of best north Indian food. Ambiance is simple and good. Their lassi is superb (Surely one of the best I have tried so far) Appetizers - Paneer and vegetarian seekh kabab are perfectly made. Main course- diwani handi, kadai panzer, deal makhni all are brilliant preparations. And my favorite is veg biryani. It's a must have here. I've heard a lot about the gulab jamun, but didn't get a chance yet to try them out. Will surely try sometime. Highly recommended."
3.5,"Visited this place yesterday. Liked the ambience.Food was above average. Masala Papad, Dal Makhani and Paan were really good. Paneer Tikka Masala was nt up to the mark and tasted stale. Naan ws a bit rubbery."
1.0,Yesterday we received a pamplet of the restaurant with menu for home delivery orders.  Thought of trying the same.  Horibal food. Tandoori Roti and Naan seemed to be made by a novice. We ended up throwing most of the food.  Never Again we are going to order from here
4.0,Nice place rooftop specially best lassi in kullad .... All food are little bit spicy interior gud in budget restaurant.... One time visit...
1.5,"I had gone for lunch to this place after hearing a lot about it from my friends.  First we ordered lassi, Jal jeera and lime soda (both lime soda and jal jeera were not cold). When we asked for ice they told us that they don't have ice, nice one.  Then we ordered Chicken tikka, chicken angara, dam aloo and paneer capsicum along with phulkas. The first three dishes were red gravy dishes and they all tasted exactly the same. And in paneer capsicum paneer was in minority.  The only thing which I liked there were phulkas.  So as from my side I am not going to recommend this place at all."
3.5,"Ambience: Punjabi road side dhaba style - 3/5 Food: Awesome punjabi food - 4.5/5 Service: Average - 3/5  Overall - 3.5/5  This place has really awesome food, but they time to serve which is somewhat irritating."
4.0,Noisy placee.. But great foood... Fulfilling... :)  Dey hav tried to give a dhaba type of ambience with khatias nd wooden planks to keep d plates and eat.. Nd itz quite good.. At rest of d tables proper chairs nd tables are provided.. Food is very good taste wise... And very very pocket friendly.. Lassi is good.. And d tikkaz... Should try...  Chicken is tender and moist.. Portions are well enough...  All in all.. Good-value for money food..
4.0,A good  restaurant which can be suggested both for lunch and dinner  .. awesome Punjabi food wit a good ambience.. they have really worked on the ambience to meet up the name of the restaurant.
3.5,"The restaurant lives up to its name.. with chaukis,small wooden tables, copper water jugs and waiters dressed up in kurtas. The place has so much energy; sometimes it becomes too noisy to hear what the person sitting next to you is saying. Cheers to this place for bringing down a slice of Punjab. But there was nothing great about the food. The portions were good. The ingredients were fresh. But there were no strong flavour of spices or any zing to the taste, as one would expect in Punjabi food. The Reshmi kebab was okayish.Liked the Missi roti. The dal tadka with deshi ghee was ordinary, no aroma of desi ghee. I'm a big fan of lassi. When I drink lassi, I get transported to a different world, I talk to noone and let the taste sink in. This lassi here sadly, couldn't reach that level of awesomeness.  This place doesn't burn a hole in the pocket. Quite on the affordable range. Would like to come back here to explore the other items"
4.0,"Finally, a good place for North Indian food which will not burn a hole in your pocket.  Really good food with authentic taste. We ordered full 4 coarse meal. In drinks we ordered lassi, chaach, zalzeera and coke. Be careful while ordering starters, paneer tikka was too spicy but tasty same with chicken tikka, not so spicy though. For main coarse, we took chicken Punjabi masala and gobhi masala, a variety of rotis. Everything was good. Gulab jamun was yum. Five of us and we got a bill of 1700/-.  Service is fast and waiters served us 3 4 plates of onion salads. :)  Ambience is nice, like a dhaba you'll find jute works and furnitures, cots and mudha are there for sitting.  Waiters dressed up in kurtas. You can find good new/old bolly music. No ac area so for lunch or summer times it gets hot and spoils the mood.  P.S-  Pan after food is must have here.  Ratings: Food- 4.3/5 Service-3.7/5 Ambience-3.8/4 Value for money- 4/5"
4.5,"I have been to both the outlets in Kundalahalli and Jaya Nagar. Food is delicious. Tandoori chicken when served hot just melts in the mouth. Kulhad lassi ka to jawaab nahi bhai. Aur khaan to kya kahein lajawaab. The USP here is the food quality, taste and PRICING. I will say one of the most economical restaurants in Bangalore. Kudos to the team"
5.0,"A regular at this place whenever I visit Bangalore. Simply love the food served here! It never disappoints ! A few must try things- chicken pepper dry , chicken tikka masala , aaloo chilly, chicken biryani !"
3.5,"In a one liner: its a bang for the buck Been here almost 4 to 5 times, and the quality of food has been subtle.  The food and the ambience gives you dhaba kind of feeling, which I love being from north india. Also the kulhad lassi rocks.  Good job CCDD! Keep it up.  Also please make sure that the waiters are polite to customers. They are sometimes NOT."
4.0,"Went here for Friday lunch with friends from work. It was a friends treat. Read on for a more detailed review of the place.  PARKING & ENTRANCE  3.5/5  The joint is located in a lane in Brookfield, and the place doesnt suggest that there is a dhaba at the rooftop level. Take a cramped elevator ride to the 3rd floor and youll find a waiting area. We had to wait for 5 mins for a table for 4 people. The place was pretty full. The waiting area has menus, I suggest you use this time to decide what youd like to eat. There was no valet service present, however there is ample parking available in front of the restaurant.  RESERVATION & SEATING  4/5  The seating is comfortable, and it wasnt too hot even though we went on a Friday afternoon. Somehow the place is well ventilated and not too hot. The AC would take away the feel of a dhaba. The stools are comfortable. Table space is ample, however the spacing between tables is not sufficient.  EXPERIENCE & AMBIANCE  4/5  The waiters served us fast. The waiters were quite generous and well mannered. They took orders quickly, told us to wait about 25 mins for the food. The food arrived in 15 mins itself. The place has a very Dhaba like feel, and is a must go at least once. It is relatively clean, and Id recommend going in the evening.  FOOD  4/5  The food quality was very good. We ordered Chicken Mirchi, Dal Tadka, Panner Tikka Masala, 8 chapatis, 4 naans. The butter milk is really good. The food has a bit too much of oil though, which makes it a bit unhealthy to eat. Also, note that the chicken is not boneless.  DESERTS  N/A  Did not indulge.  COST  4.5/5  Among 4 of us, we spent about Rs. 1300. Very economical place to go to. Worth the money."
4.0,"Great restaurant, loved the ambience. Its a village kind of feeling you get here. Great taste, great quality, good service. Phulkas would be too good here."
3.0,"went for a dinner with my colleagues. The location of the place was okay. I didn't  find any good ambience. When it rains, it's horrible. coming to the food, all the foods are tasted good. happy with the taste. service is not so good. I would like to recommend to provide good service and ambience needs to be improve. rated it as 3.0 only for the food."
4.0,One of the finest dining restaurant found in Brookfield. The ambience was great which can get u a feel of pure punjab style. Bit rush on weekends so better to have prior reservations. Enjoy the great food !!
4.5,"Must say this place is one of the best when it comes to serving North Indian food in Bangalore . Have been there a couple of times now. The ambiance is very good and it does justice to it's name.The staff is very much welcoming . The food is sensational. Their Chicken Keema and Lassi is a must try for everyone . Funny thing is in the same building there are three more restaurants , but you will see all the people waiting outside to get a table here only .I guess that sums up how good this place is .  Tip : Not recommended for couples as ts always crowded . Even on weekdays may it be lunch or dinner"
4.0,"A decent place to have some North Indian stuff.. Open terrace dining is a nice arrangement here.. Have been here couple of times, and I have not been disappointed.."
4.5,nice punjabi food ....veg main course and non veg starter were excellent...non veg main course was not that good Staff 3.5/5  Food 4.5/5  Ambiance 4.5/5  Value for money 5/5 its full in weekend.reservation recommended
3.0,"The starters are brilliant, but I didn't really get the taste of authentic Punjabi food. Most of their gravies, the spicy ones, tasted the same, because of some different cooking oil that leaves its dominant taste. But it's still one of the better restaurants in the area."
4.0,"To start with , i was searching for a decent place for throwing a lunch party for my colleagues and finally found this place. Reached early to the venue around 12.30 ,and to my surprise the place was buzzing. For starters we ordered malaiChicken,masala papad,paneer tikkas,kulhad lassi.For lunch, it was chicken lasuniya,dal fry,naan,kulchas,phulkas. Malai chicken and kulhad lassi are definitely a must try ! Other items were also  delicious.And the rates are quite nominal. I would definitely suggest going to this place atleast once ."
4.0,"awesome food!! desi dhaba-style ambiance but the management made us wait , too long for our order. A decent place to have authentic punjabi food in the kundalahalli proximity. Nonetheless, surely a must visit!!! Subhajeet Roy"
4.5,A great place with a good dhaba wala ambience....reasonable price...serving takes a bit time....quite often you would find a waiting line...but all of this is worth when you find the delicious hot food served at your table...the lassi tastes great....a perfect place to go out @dinner with friends !!!
4.5,Desi and I love it!  The place reminds you a bit of dhabas of northern highways having that decor.  Went in an afternoon of a weekday and had to wait for 15 minutes to get my seat. Yes that crazy even on a weekday.  Food was just amazing. Salt lassi n malai chicken tikka n dal makhani. Everything was just too amazing.  Decently priced as per the place. Would definitely like to visit for dinner here.  Staff 3/5 Food 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Value for money 4/5 Reservation recommended.
3.5,"The food is good, but not great. Ambiance is good but the service is slow. And I felt it to be a little overpriced compared to what they provide."
4.0,"I was searching for good punjabi food, and see I landed at the correct place. The best place to taste the punjabi cuisine. We had ordered for chicken as well as mutton both normal curries and both were really great. Ambience is just like the dhaba kind, very lively and full of enthu..... Must try..."
4.5,"Awesome place. People who miss that dhaba environment in the north, should really visit this place. Food quality great. I found butter chicken a little sweet. The chicken tikkas are mouth watering."
4.5,We go there every weekend....I just love it
4.0,"Food : 3.5/5 , (Lassi 5/5 .. lip smacking , been there twice.. every time no less than 2 glasses :D ) .  Ambience  : 4/5 ( depends where your seats are ) Variety : 3/5  Authentic north Indian food . Great taste . I feel this was an ideal place to put a buffet . Too bad they didn't ."
3.0,The place is cramped.. ambience is similar to a dhaba.. full marks to that.. lassi is a must have here. All the items we ordered were decent. I liked it.. its a bit costly compared to other restaurants of this genre.. overall average ratings..
3.5,"Well I was quite disappointed by the experience I had here, despite it having such a good review. They have less space and more crowd. And the food taste not what I had expected reading zomato reviews. May be because of huge demand this place is loosing the taste for which it is famous for."
4.0,I just love this place. Best north Indian food around the corner. The lassi amazing. And the ambience of a small village plus the waiters dressed in pajama and kurta. Totally worth the price.
4.5,"Nice place to hang out. I liked their rooftop arrangements. Food simply was awesome and lip smacking. We ordered chicken tikka kebab, chicken butter masala and nun roti. Goes well on the pocket too. Staffs were humble and polite. Would like to visit again soon. Perfect place to go for a  group or office party."
4.0,Nice Place to Hang out with friends and Family ... satisfied with the food (Don't forget to Try out Salt Lusssy) ... Price is Reasonable - 1000 Rs per 3 guys.
4.0,"If you ever feel like going to a authentic Punjabi dhaba inside Banglore city I would suggest this place. Starters are tastey and lassi was delicious. Never go for Biriyani here. Dhabas are not meant to serve good Biriyani. Most try kebabs and lassi in mud glass. Main course was average. Relax with a sweet pan served inside dhaba if u feel heavy after the meal. Ambiance was good so as service. The place is very cheap if you compare its food quality, ambiance and service. Definitely going again with my friends for the dhaba feeling and tasty starters. Go early in weekends as it would be crowded after 8.15 pm."
3.0,"Went there for a week end dinner, with lots of expectations. Being a reunion of friend with respective families we wanted to spent some time together. But to ruin our plan was the waiting of around 45-50 minutes. Went in, in a table for 4, we 8 were adjusted. Starters took another 45-50 minutes to be served on our plates. Next set of starters and main course came together after another 40 minutes. Food was good, both in taste and quantity. But really disappointed with the service and waiting. Should have been informed in advance that it will take approx 45 minutes but we were kept in waiting by being informed of jus 15 minutes more or 10 minutes more.  I recommend people to go there on week days or with ample amount of time. 2 & 1/2 hours for dinner, in which 1 & 1/2 hours will be waiting.  We started with masala papad which was a disappointment. But then the veg seekh kabab, Manchurian & chicken hariyali tikka was good. Main course had missi n tandoori roti with dal makkhani, methi malai mutter and chicken Angara. It was mouth lickerinng and yummy.  With to mention was lassi, too good. Give a miss to butter milk.  Pricing is nor too high nor too low. There charges are ok.  More to mention we were a group of 8."
4.5,"Great ambience. Tasty food. Quick and lovely service. Go soon otherwise wait for a table.  Veg kolhapur was very good. Afghani chicken, fried rice etc..all items are good. Their phulkas stand out."
3.5,The food is decent and average ... The thing I really like was the decor and ambience ... It's in top floor 2/3 rd is covered 1/3 is open air has Chaukis placed ... Nice open air atmosphere the last time I dined with couple of my friends...
3.5,"here is my review on the restaurant.first things first. Ambience is good.restaurant has been placed in very good strategic location. It is crowded by 8.30 pm when I left. Coming to food I ordered a malai kebab as a starter which is good but not as spicy as I wish. I ordered chicken lausia ,a gravy item which is really good to have with roomali roti. Over all the food is good and can rate 3.5/5."
3.5,There are very few places in Brookefield where you can truly enjoy authentic Punjabi meal. I truly appreciate this place for their effort. They have converted a basic terrace to make a good dhaba where you can enjoy the food they make. The taste component is good enough for a night out.
4.5,Amazing Punjabi Food! Don't worry too much about the ambience and other details. The food more then makes up for that. Service is a bit slow. But that's mainly because of the crowd.
5.0,amazing food and ambiance. its a great place to hangout. food quality and quantity is good. rate is normal. i have been here 3 times before and tried different curry and it was good.
3.5,"I've been here twice now. Chulka is Located near Brookfield, above jade! Everytime I come here, first thing I order is the Lassi... Loved it! Being a vegetarian, I had a lot of options in starters as well as in main course but the number of desserts are very less! Reasonable priced and service was also pretty fast."
4.5,"The dhaba ambiance is superbly represented here with rooftop open air setup, cane furniture cots,tables and chairs and even the old style lanterns. Food is amazing with a variety of dishes. All in all a real dhaba experience."
4.5,Amazing place...Superb quality of food...some waiting to get your number but it is worth it...service little bit slow ....good ambiance......
3.5,Well..I heard about this dhaba from one of my friends..So just wanted to give a try..went here for dinner on weekend.. It was too crowded. Had to wait fr some time. Tried veg food. It was good but not that gr8..  Food 7/10 Ambience 7/10 Service 6/10
4.0,"Went to this place .. On my wife's recommendation. Only-veg day for both of us as it was Ramnavami. So, ordered baby corn Manchurian as starter, taste was good. For main course we had stuffed kulcha n paneer butter masala. Kulcha was really awesome with very spicy stuffing and the curry was as it should be. Moreover it has a nice theme and ambience of dhaba. Overall a beautiful lunch experience. Liked it n must recommend to others. Will surely visit another time to have a taste of non-veg dishes."
4.0,"Awesome vegetarian food. It was a dinner planned with one of my friends we had malai kofta, daal tadka and fulkas, everything was exceptionally well."
3.5,"The place is perfect for yummy Punjabi Lunch. It gives a special feel to sit in the open air with grass and gravel around. Coming to the food the bread and curries are delicious, but the rice items don't match the level of the Rotis."
1.0,"Unwilling to deliver Rs. 520 order. You have to order extra to reach the minimum of 600 for them to deliver within 1 km radius. To top it all, the person taking the order had no interest in making the sale. Never ordering again."
3.5,Good food worth the visit.. The paneer kofta was good..  rotis could have been much better but on the whole good food and good ambience .. Service is good
3.5,"Definitely, one of the best places in bengaluru to have north indian punjabi food(not to forget the prices there). They have pretty nice service but still you will have to wait for sometime to get a table on a weekend. Do try butter chicken, dal makhani and malai kofta (if you are veg)."
4.0,"Been at their Jp nagar outlet. We ordered usual veg food : baby corn manchurian, kadhai paneer etc. food was very yummy but on the spicier side which you must expect if you are visiting a dhaba."
4.0,"After a long time I visited alacart restaurant. The restaurant has made quite a buzz and I was planning to visit it for a long time. Firstly, there is no facility to make reservations so try to reach the place nice and early. Basically they have tried to give the restaurant a very desi ambience with khaats,steel plates and all..but looks very superficial..the place is quite small and gets really congested. The service is okay..but the management is weak. Had to wait a long time for some of the basic things like water,napkins,extra spoons etc. Coming to the food..in starters paneer tikka was wonderful,baby corn tikka was okay..in main course daal tadka was passable..mushroom was good..moreover the dishes are not really costly..highlight of the meal was kulhad lassi...your visit won't be worth if you don't try it.. Truly RECOMMENDED!"
4.0,Brilliant chicken starters. Rustic ambience. Cool place even on hour summer afternoons. Only turnoff is a couple of extraordinary rude staff members. Recommended- Book a table on weekends.
3.0,"Nice place to have nice punjabi food,  but extremely bad service.  Went to CCDD for team lunch,  the veg and non veg starters were really good,  the veg and non veg gravies were average.  Roties were good,  but rice items were average.  Lassi is a must try. The place is cramped up with normal ambience.  The service was a huge let down.  Waited for an hour to get the main course. If they concentrate on the service with the same quality of food, then a definite place to go in ACES for punjabi food.  Price is bit high for the entire experience."
4.5,"This restaurant is a fabulous place to hangout and enjoy pure Punjabi food...we went there for a team lunch and everyone love it.....The ambience is a plus factor here...cots as dining table...jute chairs to sit and grass and stones on the floor to give u a feel of roadside dhaba....steel plate and glass to eat...a pan shop as to enter the restaurant and many more small things that make this place special. The service is also good and quick. Coming to the food u will taste a very good Punjabi khana here....rich gravy and soft roti....we ordered    jal jeera,chicken sheek kabab,chicken pepper dry, panner chat pata and kababs as starters , then butter naan,butter kulcha ,ghee roti in Indian breads and chicken handi,chicken tikka masala, veg saagwala in main course. The best part is the creamy lasssi....The gravies were rich and yummy with tons of butter...the chicken were soft and tender which makes the dish perfect. The roti  and naans were soft and perfectly made....and to add all these delicious food a pan in the end makes us smile.....Always recommended..."
4.0,"ATLAST! PHEW visited the place. The new happening place in Brookfield! The place is always crowded so don't expect it to be peaceful & quiet. As the name suggest t ambience gives you a dhaba feel. Ordered for 2 - reshmi kabab, kulcha , butter nan, stuff kulcha,panner tikka masala, lassi & lime juice. Reshmi kabab comes wrapped in omelette which was t best among what we ordered & the Chicken is very tender (must try).  Kulcha ,stuff kulcha & butter nan - nothing to rave about but not disappointed  Paneer tikka masala - asked the guy to suggest some spicy veg curry as my friend was on lent but the curry was not at all spicy but still we liked it. It had huge pieces of paneer in it 4 or 5 . One curry is enough for two (i am not a big fan of paneer) still the gravy tasted good.  Lassi - not a big fan of lassi either but after having one glass I couldn't resist had one more its goooooood ( must try)  Lime juice - provide it cold please I should really appreciate them for their service one of the best. Number of staff to customer ration is high which is good.  Definitely visiting again! Portions are bit less please look in to it & also ter is a pan wala to complete the meal ?"
3.5,"This place is just easy to find. Its right on the AECS main road. Its on the top floor of the building which bears Jade, and 2 more restaurants. Ambience is quite good. The lighting is a bit low ... but it adheres to the dhaba theme.  Pros:  1. Portions of the food served is quite good - Starters, Gravies were quite filling and each dish would easily serve 3 people. The butter naan had 3 big pieces! 2. Rates are normal - Not too low, not too high. Just right. 3. Ambience - People who like dhaba environmet will love this place for sure. Not me though! 4. The food is on the table within no time! 5. Paneer was super soft here. Both Starters and main course.  Cons: 1. They dont serve food to the plates ! They just leave it on the table. May be its their dhaba istyle.. ! 2. They dont have Soups in their menu. Atleast a Tomato shorba was expected. I couldnt keep my soup loving son satisfied :( 3. We had Kadai paneer for the Mains and found it rather sweet. We informed the waiter not to keep it spicy, but what we got was a sweet Kadai paneer. Did not expect this.  4. The Lime Juice that we ordered was also oversweet.   Coming back ? - May be no  VFM - 4/5 Ambience - 4/5 Taste - 3/5"
3.0,"In this weekend I was there . this place is too packed. We were 7 person that's why we waited around half hour. Food was just OK , ambience is like a panjabi dhaba in middle of city. Here's butter milk too good."
1.0,DONTever try this restra. Pathetic..service food quality is dipping day by day...wrong attitude of staff. In all..one of the worst restr. I have ever been.
5.0,Superb food.good & fast service tandoori roti dhal fry & their special lassi must have. They should come up with a bigger vision of having it in a big area in ground floor with a punjabi them.like smaller version of choki dhani jaipur
3.5,"Located on the top floor, this restaurant is known for its North Indian food. Good food in less price. Service is not so good as compared to other restaurants in Bangalore. For serving the food, we need to again and again call the waiter."
4.5,If want to get the feel of real dhaba then this is the place you should go. Ambience is really good so as service.  Food quality is more than average.
3.5,I would say this place is more for the ambience and not for the food. Its not bad yes but then again you would better not expect yummilicious food coz its pretty average. Hope they bring in more punjabiness to the food :)
3.0,Fast and attentive service. The chaas was good.  The baby corn tikka was good but the Orange color of the Masala stayed on my finger a few hours after the dinner  ... Not pleasant.  We ordered a simple meal of phulkas with egg burji and matar paneer.  The burji was great and the paneer too indistinct.  Standard fare.  Go once in a while ...a real while.
3.5,Ambience of dhaba is very nice. I love the lassi in big copper glasses. Keeping it up by fast service. Tasty north indian food with reasonable price.
3.5,"Located on the top floor, this restaurant offers a wide variety of seating option both indoors and outdoors. The also have the ""khatiya"" option for u to sit on.  Coming to the food, things to try here  Sawariya chicken starter, Punjabi chicken with ghee phulkas. The ghee phulkas here are worth dying for (technically u will considering the amt of ghee is on it). But believe me u will loose count of just how many u may have had. The lassi in ""kulhad"" and the pan are an awesome way to end the meal here..  Perfect place for good food which does not make a hole in your pocket."
3.5,"Great food, but weekend is not the time to go there as its way too crowded and huge waiting plus the service goes down on those days. Rest is good, very spicy tasty food, do try chicken tikka masala."
3.5,"Love kalmi kabab and lassi here ,one of the better places in Whitefield to have good food, reasonable rates,veg menu can be improved. Have tried few veg dishes ..will say average."
4.0,"i would definitely give them a thumbs up for the catchy tag line.. and well on the other it is just not like a dhaba, dhaba's are pretty different but, you can expect quite decent punjabi food, with somewhat close to the taste you would expect.it is a decently priced eating joint and has quite good portions in their dishes, and the ambience does feel a bit different in an extremely nice way which pulls you to visit it again. :) although i feel the starters were over priced, but as an whole it would cost around 1.5 k for 5 to 6 boys with an appetite condition being you go for the main course and not the starters and the pudding, trust me on this one. :D"
2.5,"It was a long day for us as we six were returning from wonderla. Suddenly we thought of having food in some punjabi restaurant. One of our frnds suggested ""chulha chauki da dhaba"". Getting all excited we reached there and to our disappointment it was too much crowded. We got a table after 10 mins.  The place was crowded and very much congested.   We placed our order as soon as we settled and we were told the food will be served in 25 mins. We ordered baby corn tikka, chicken kabab ( as chicken tikka was not available) , tandoori roti, dal tadka, chicken masala and shahi paneer. After 15 minutes our first starter came I.e. baby corn. Next chicken kabab came after half hour. And finally after 1 hour when main coarse came, it was a huge dissapointment. Rotis were hard, no salt in dal and gravys also not according to our expectations.  When I asked my friend about his previous visit experience and he said - ""I made the same mistake again ""  - Too congested - Taste not as expectes from a punjabi restaurant  - Very slow service  - Ignorant attitude of waiters.   I would suggest to reduce number of tables to make more space, waiters to become more friendly and proactive servicing.  Serving food faster will also be good.  I hope if I have to visit this place again I see some improvements."
5.0,"Nice place. Food is good. Nominal. Infra is very cool. Must try place in Kundalahalli, Brookfield area. Weekends will be huge rush. Need to wait for an  hour after booking.  5 based on interiors, food, cost."
3.5,"One place for regular eat outs. They deliver too. Try desi ghee roti and Dal if you are dining in. Taste is good and priced properly. Slightly high on spice.  However, my last visit to the restaurant was disappointing. In spite of repeatedly asking for boneless chicken, we were served with bones. The taste was not up to the mark. The behaviour of the staff needs a lot of improvement. After asking to remove the wrongly delivered items from the bill, they refused the same. Will be a while before I call them up for another delivery or think about dining in there."
4.0,Ambience is great .. taste is rich.. North Indian delicacies .. you get the dhaba feel sitting there amidst the IT area... panneer chilly is yummm.. must go to this place ..
4.0,now u can get the feel of a dhaba in the middle of the city and you do not even have to got to the city outskirts.all this because of chulha chauki da dhaba.  first of all the ambience gives you a real dhaba feel.i have been to itpl and jayanagar locations and you can even eating open sky at some sections of the restaurant.the service is so good.every staff member wears a kurta and is constantly checking if you require any service.the staff to customer ration is the highest i have ever seen!!  coming to the food it is simply fantastic.the paneer tikkas and chicken tikkas are smoked tasty and super large portions with a mind chutney and onion lime salad so good.the garlic hot chicken was so superb and tasty and a treat.the naans are super thin and crispy.the lassi is rich and very tasty.just once i was disappointed with the mix veg curry otherwise liked everything else.it is a total value for money too.the itpl branch offers home delivery too but you are better off visiting this dhaba inside your city.  food-3.5/5 ambience-4/5 value for money-4/5 service-4.5/5
4.5,This place is ideal for nice north Indian food at a very reasonable price. We had a great wholesome meal ...its was delightful..highly recommended!!
4.5,"Great north Indian food. Unfortunately, you may face issues with other things than food. For example, finding a car parking space near by is challenge. Believe, its an AECS problem. If you do manage to park and make your way up, you may find the stairs blocked by all the hungry patrons waiting for their turn at the restaurant. If you can still hold on to that fire in your belly, you may get a place to sit after a little wait. The lead time to serve you food may again prep your hunger but, trust me when food starts coming, you will not mind any of the stuff before it. Remember, when they say spicy - they really mean it!"
4.0,"When with friends and you want to have some good North Indian food... the nearest possible place that came to our mind was CCDD :-) . Though we had been there before but the waiting time made us order food this time. After couple of waiting beeps on phone we finally got thru (this was expected phone traffic is quiet high during peak hour). We ordered Paneer Butter Masala: it came as expected with a swirl of cream on top, lil sweet on taste but absolutely delight. Chicken Butter Masala: This i believe is the USP of the outlet. Gravy was pretty much same as Panner Butter Masala. Chicken Tikka Masala: hot and spicy are the 2 words that come to my mind when i think of it. I could see chilli pieces in the gravy. And trust me if you looking for some thing hot and spicy which will bring tears in your eyes Just go for it. :-) On the bread/ chappati side we ordered plain naan but the lag of about 30 minutes will make any bread of refined flour (maida) little stretchy.Wheat bread also became stretch but little less. They do charge for containers 7/- per pc. Over all good food. Look forward to visit them in person and have the non strechy bread. This place wont hit your pocket too hard."
4.5,"Had been planning to visit this place for quite some tym and finally did.... had heard a lot about this place so wanted to know what this hype ws all about... went here with a friend after office... both of us were exhausted and just wanted a place to relax and enjoy tasty food... and that's what exactly happened.... to start with... the plates was very hygienic, a must have for me! Also the food was delish.. seekh kababs, kadhai paneer and naan, each dish was tasty and quantity was also great... more than any other restaurant I've come across in this city. Had heard that this place was pricy but I disagree. I found it quite economic. And the ambience.... this place is made to look like an actual road side dhaba we come across every few kilometres on a highway in North India... and with an added benefit... it is much more organised and hygienic. A must visit!"
4.5,"This one was in my list for a long time. Thanks to my couple of buddies the wait was over... Had been over lunch..  Ambience 3/5 Food  4/5 Service 4/5  Had tried the Afghani Kababs. The chicken was so succulent and tender and we were stunned..   Speciality is the butter chicken. We took boneless option. I have not eaten such a kind of this dish for a long time.. It gave a tough competition to Moti Mahal restaurant in Andheri (W), Mumbai.. Had rotis to go with it..   Finally the sweet lassi in kulhard was the complete satisfaction.. The look reminds me of the hot milk served in kulhard. As I tasted the lassi, was taken back to think the taste of Mishti Doi (Bengali Desert)  Awesome dinning experience.."
4.0,Went to ds place suddenly for an unplanned dinner..and boy...was I grateful...starting wit d ambience..its a dimly lit place wit chaukis al arnd...nice relaxed atmosphere... V ordered veg seekh kebab.. Kadhai paneer. Butter nan..lime juice n JAL jeera...kebab was nice...paneer was also tasty.. Naan was also crisp..d drinks were nt cold...v askd dm n dey replaced the nimbu paani..but said cold jal jeera was nt available....was a little disappointed... Service is good...shud go...good food is  sufficient reason.. Dhaba bol do...
3.5,"This place is just brimming with people on weekends.. My friend says its crowded on weekdays as well. This place seems a fav with big crowds. It would take around 15-20 mins( more if u have a bigger crowd). The waiting area is very cramped. Once inside the place is bustling with life and has a good nakli(false) dhaba aura. There's the terrace area which is semi open and great to sit. They have tried bringing on the rustic look as much possible with the charpoy and modas(seating stools) and lanterns. Coming to the food we had kalmi kebab(a little over charred but nicely in taste), chicken lollypop Manchurian which was good enough. The chicken in both cases succulent and well cooked. For main course we had butter garlic naan which was okayish. Mind you their naan has 3 slices. Famed butter chicken was also great. Perfectly spiced and cooked. The lassi had elaichi/cardamom which didn't go with my taste. But then it was thick and creamy. FYI they don't have sweet salt mix lassi..either sweet or salt. Don't ask to mix because it really didn't taste good that way. The staff is courteous and very prompt. Service is amazingly fast, I am sure they can't afford to lag given the waiting crowd. Overall for me its a pretty decent north Indian joint. Total value for money Cost for 2 Not even 1000 bucks!"
2.5,"The place is exploting it's popularity. Used to be a good place to eat north indian food few times back, but my recent visits to the place has proved tasteless. Place is crowded like hell but food quality has definitely gone down in recent past."
3.5,"Was here on a Saturday night, and it was so crowded. We had to wait for over an hour to get a seat. What I loved about Chulha Chowki is the ambience. The earthen lamps, the chowkis, moodhas and the sandy floor really adds to the whole Dhaba Feel ! But I found the found to be really okay. May be it was becuase ,it became very late by the time we got a seat, around 10.30. So I wish to visit the place once again and hopefully it changes my opinion this time."
4.0,Typical dhaba ambience and very noisy.  No booking facility.. Waiting time depends on the crowd..we have hardly waited for a longer time...Food is great. Value for money..worth a visit
1.5,"I visited this place yesterday evening, when we reached the place ,it was packed and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table.I heard a lot about this place so just wanted to try.  We ordered a couple of starters and veg & non veg main course.The food was of poor quality, I am normally very considerate towards a restaurants food , but this was appaling. The Chicken butter masala failed to  impress.The chicken wasnt cooked properlly, when we called the manager,he had no clue whats wrong with the food.  Not recommended, although the price list seems affordable and on the lower side,but its not worth it.   Seating and ambience was shabby and unclean, it looked like a hostel mess. These things are secondary but the food quality was really below par. I gave them 1.5 stars just for its existence . Highly disappointed."
4.0,"We had our lunch at Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba, Brookefield today. The restaurant is styled like a dhaba with moodas and charpai/manjaa and old lanterns hanging outside. It is located on a rooftop which makes it look plausible.  In starters, we ordered veg seekh kebab, reshmi kebabs and kalmi kebabs along with butter milk. Reshmi kebabs were served wrapped in omelette which was delicious. Veg seekh was also good.  In the main course, we ordered, afghani chicken, dahiwala chicken and kadai paneer along with tandoori roti and butter naan. Both the chicken dishes were well prepared but we found the serving size to be a bit small for us.   The seating was comfortable and waiters were quick in serving our food. Its one of the better places to have North Indian food in Bangalore.  Food - 4/5 Ambiance - 4/5Service - 4/5VFM - 4/5"
4.0,"CCDD is a nice attempt to bring about a dhaba type restaurant amidst cityscape ( that too on rooftop ). The footfall at the restaurant is worth appreciating. We got a seat only after waiting for around 20 minutes ( a good time for them to think about capacity  enhancement).  I liked the moodhas and khat concept but the ambiance could have been better. The rooftop locale has not been much exploited as most part of the restaurant is covered with thatch as roof.  But still I gave a pretty high rating because the food taste and quantity are totally worth your money and time. We, a group of 6 friends, had lassi, butter milk, Gobi chili starter, special tikka, masala papad, raita, veg kadai gravy, paneer baby corn masala, fulka and paan. Each item is worth tasting. Loved the fulkas. The cost came around 200/- per person which is pretty cheap compared to other restaurants in Bangalore. 1 bowl/plate of the curries and starters served the 6 of us surprisingly well.  Wish they had options in sweets. Currently they are only serving gulab jamuns.  Nice place to dine. Do visit atleast once."
3.5,"I had high expectations from this place. But after one dinner, that kind of dipped. The rotis I got where not that great. The gravies were good. The ambiance is that of a good dhabba, they have nailed it in using the space they got well. Here, I would prefer dine in to take away."
4.0,Went there after a frd suggested this place... Must say it exceeded my expectations in every regard... Ambience was lively.. Though it was a bit noisy but dint bother us much... Food was good... Buttermilk was gr8... Overall a good experience for the price...
3.5,"Their JP Nagar branch had been on my whislist for quite sometime coz of its proximity to home but while searching for restaurants near work(brookefield), this was one of the options and immediately got here with 2 of my colleagues. Pretty easy to locate and the zomato location is perfect!   On the third floor of a building which has 3 other restaurants but the only place with ppl teeming inside and outside was this. Had to wait for about 10 mins for a table. The place has a wonderful dhaba like feel to it and very tastefully done up! The lanterns, copper utensils, typical dhaba style seating including the small jute stools are pretty well done and give you near dhaba like experience!  The menu is predominantly north indian but there a few Chinese dishes in the starters and mains sections which can be avoided for obvious reasons! We got the butter milk,sawariya kebab, veg kofta curry, tandoori roti and phulkas.  Butter milk- pretty refreshing and tasty! Not very spicy but the taste of ginger is predominant. Bite sized pieces of ginger and finely chopped coriander leaves add a nice look to this .  Sawariya kebab- as only 2 of us were non veggies, we got half plate of this dish. 3 medium sized, green color, well cooked pieces of chicken served with a tangy,spicy onion salad. The succulent pieces of chicken were really tasty and I m guessing that all other kebabs would be of same if not better quality.  Veg kofta curry- waiter's choice this was when we asked for a medium spicy main dish. 4-5 pieces of kofta(mixed veg) which was not very oily in a creamy,slightly sweet gravy. Small pieces of paneer also could be found in the dish.  Breads- nothing special about the phulka and tandoori roti. Pretty decent both of them were wrt quantity and quality.  Bill came up to 567 for all this which pretty economical. Good food, great ambience. Surely coming back for more.  Suggestions: 1. Could have more options for dessert( Oly gulab jamun currently)   2. Waiters though efficient at service could have a small smile on their face while interacting with the guests and also have better,pleasing expressions on their faces"
4.0,True paradise 4 people who love the old village stuff  The food is really good especially north indian food  In fact i would say it is one of the rare places in bangalore where you can expect the true taste of north indian food  They have emulated village kind of ambience where instead of fancy lights you will see lanterns hanging from the roof   All the time you can hear soft music from the old 70s 80s and sometimes they also play the latest music  Whenever i am in the brookfield area i would always dine here
4.0,If you have a craving for dhaba kind of food with the experience at Whitefield close to your workplace then Chula Chauki da Dhaba is must to try out. Amazing food loved the Rotis plus the curries/sabzi. You should try the paneer malai tikka its simply too good. Missi roti was really good too :) my friends who had come along had non veg loved it. Lassi is simply too good.  P s reach early if as this place gets filled up too quickly during lunch hours :)
4.5,Awesome food. The ambiance was super awesome. The staff was a bit rude but I can let it pass as the food was excellent. The rates are not sky high but decent. Overall a must go.
4.5,"The ambience is quite nice. The food quality is awesome, you should have the lassi! The prices are reasonable. The waiting time can be a bit of a problem if you go around 8:30pm on a weekend."
3.5,"So my roomie suggested this place for Sunday's cook's day out dinner. Was amazed to see the rush so the expectations took a hit for good. As we entered we were greeted by a modest yet a cozy ambience..the place was made to eat only.. So don't have notions of good music playing to break the ice of your conversation. Now let's come to the food.. Authentically Desi looking food which you carve for in Bangalore .. Nice blend of spices that roll in your mouth.. And a modest presentation .. The food was good.. Wouldn't go far as calling it awesome but was good. Pretty filling and a nice Desi aroma to it. Then came the lassi .. And trust me for Bangalore it was a damn good lassi .. Cardamom, thick curd sweet ..yum. Now the amazing part .. 3 people .. Bill was just 700 bucks amazing !! In short .. Good service .. Good taste .. Simple ambience and splendid prices .. Thumbs up"
4.5,The ambience is good...food deliverd by dem was vry tasty... Non veggies will love d place... Being a punjabii i loved d sweet lassi.....it make me remeber my punjab..as sweet as i will hv dere in punjab. Eating food sitting on khaat was awesome. Mushroom tikka was tastyy...we love d starters. :) :) Must go place
1.0,Had most terrible experiance ever in bangalore.There was rusted iron wire in one of the dish that we ordered.After informing to manager instead of admiting he started arguing with us in a rude manner. service was pathetic. Food was ok as per price. you can go at your own risk make sure you have health insurance before you visit :p
4.0,"USP about the place is the price point... We were 4 adults... Ordered veg, non veg, lassi, sweet dish, rice, nanns, dal ... All within 1000 bucks!! But then what makes the place even better is the food... From the time I have moved to Bangalore ... Last 5 months... This is by far the best north Indian eatery... Be it the spices, colour of food, other ingredients... Very north Indian... Loved it.... Don't be fooled by the size of the bowls in which they serve... It might look small but is deep enough and hence no issues on the quantity front... Just right.... Ambience is is what u can expect from a dabha... Yes it is crowded, noisy but cosy... I mean dabhas are meant to be this way.... It is on roof top hence options of sitting  indoor and outdoor ... Charpais, khat, lartens... The lighting is not dull.. Just about right.... Location and parking is not a problem... Prominent....service is quick and prompt... They got a Pan shop too and yes the lassi is by far the best.... If you want to enjoy good north India food in a not so formal setup... Without burning a hole In Your pocket... This is a place... I am sure to visit them regularly...."
4.0,Really tasty food at reasonable prices. A regular visitor here.  Located near the main road and easily accessible. Crowded most times. A good place to have yummy north Indian food
4.5,"Good Food , Good Ambience , Good Service.  Both Veg and Non Veg dishes were good. The quantity was also fulling.  Though the price is a bit high , one can visit here for a good overall experience."
1.5,"The food is too costly and too oily. service is slow compared to the rates. with such high rates, good service and excellent food is expected. i am not a fan and will not be visiting again."
4.5,"Best place with quality north indianfood with pocket friendly prices. It is placewithambiencelike tradional dhabha's. Weekends are too crowdedmay takeapprox an hourto deliver your whole order.Recommended for treats, cheap meals and Tandori."
3.5,"Was there for an unofficial office party. Ambience was pretty good. The seating arrangements on traditional dhaba style chaukis and wooden moras was somewhat interesting. The place was somewhat crowded, on a Thursday night. As far as the food is concerned, the vegetarian dishes were good. We had some variant of malai tikka paneer - which tasted good. Among the non veg dishes, the handi chicken and the punjabi chicken failed to impress much, but remaining dishes were okay. Pricing is standard, and overall it was a good experience. Recommendable - yes, for the dhaba type ambience and the experience of sitting on a chauki for food!"
4.0,Good place with lots of varieties and the price is also reasonable ! The ambience is very good ! Gives you the feeling of eating in dhaba ! !
2.0,Found an insect crawling in the handi veg.  The food is very spicy.  The tables are congested.  Good for one time only.  They should ensure hygiene is maintained.

4.0,Been to this place 4 times in past 3 months. Different theme. Food is good. Mix of spicy and sweet dishes. Price is very reasonable (250/person : veg and 300/person : non veg)
5.0,"The Brookefields outlet is my favorite restaurant at Bangalore and I have been there several times. The food is awesome, and as close to North Indian food as you can get in Bangalore, especially if you like the simple phulkas. The sweet lassi is good here. The yellow dal tadka is a must try! The ambience is good with a dhaba like look. You can also sit and dine on the ""khats"" giving an even better North Indian village like feeling. The food is reasonably priced and never has my bill exceeded approximately Rs. 200 per person with a drink, starters and main course covered. If you are going on a weekend, make sure you reach early as the waiting time during peak hours can exceed an hour!"
3.5,"I have been to this place many times now and the experience has always been a pleasant one!  The khatiyas,muddas and old bollywood soundtracks do give you the ""Dhabba waali feel"" :). Do try to get a place on the open terrace. It may take you longer but its worth the wait!  Its become a tradition among my friends to share the 6 pc. Kalmi Kabab for starters and is probably the reason why we keep going back to this place. The spice level for most of the items on the main course is towards the higher side which makes the sweet Lassi a necessity! Make sure you have the Lassi in a Khullad. (It's just better that way!)"
4.0,We have order food here for our office lunch..taste was too good. dal tadka was good..we have ordered more veg curries which was tasty..we all enjoyed the food..
4.5,Awesome ambience to eat...awesome food they serve...awesome taste of food...a great place to enjoy with ur friends or partners..both veg & non veg worth price...                                                                 chetanchauhan.in
4.0,Food is great. Essence is great. Lassi not to be forgotten.. A bit tough to find the way if you are going on your own vehicle.. Food is not cooked properly sometimes
3.5,"Awesome north Indian food with great ambience but songs should be Punjabi .  Must order paneer tikka with sprinkled lemon. Baby corn tikka is a no go. Main course any dal,  bundi ki raita and veg kadaai if u like spicy. Desert is still missing which is must after having north Indian cuisine. My suggestion kheer should be added in this section."
4.0,"If you are non vegetarian, then go for angara chicken, you will definitely love it. There are plenty of options though for veg and non veg both. Good food overall. Sometimes service gets delayed because of crowd. Otherwise everything is good."
2.5,"I was shocked to see so much crowd there when I went first. It wasn't Sunday and a crowd like that is least expected. The restaurant is set up beautifully. It has 3 sections- one for covered dining, terrace dining and semi covered dining. The decors give a Dhaba feeling with the cots, old lanterns, aluminium plates, jute tables, etcService is fast enough. The waiters are also dressed in traditional wear. Service could be improved if the waiters were more alert. We had to call them every time we wanted the plates to be removed, or for a extra glass of water.I would say the food is not that good. The menu is quite good with many varieties for both veg and non veg but the food lacked that extra touch of spices. It was very simple and plain. was a bit disappointed with the taste."
4.0,I have always loved their JP Nagar branch outlet. Best place to give treats. This branch is just the same. But it also has actual Chauki where you can comfortably sit and enjoy your food open air. Love their Masala papad and Lassi - my favourites here. A pocket friendly north Indian restaurant. Would love to visit again and again.
3.5,the 4 rating is just because at the price point what Chulha Chowki ka Dhaba is serving people in Brookfield area..its difficult to get it anywhere else. Excellent ambience setup like a Dhaba look and good food at decent rates three of us visited the place and ordered few starters main dishes ..and bill never crossed 1000 bucks..which at Bangalore is very decent Highly recommended if you are in this part of the town and want to have a good and cheap meal
4.0,"Visited on new yr eve,coz of this faced lot of rush but that was worth waiting. Good ambience Punjabi style.Order 2 veg dishes with some Phulka which were good in taste. Overall satisfactory experience."
4.0,"Wanted to try out a new place for lunch on New years Eve and stumbled upon this while searching around kundanhalli and AECS layout. Was pleasantly surprised to see a consider number of customers already seated and we had to struggle to find a place. The ambience is decent, interiors made of bamboo and given a dhaba look. There is also an open air area which should be great at night. We ordered 2 naan, 1 Paneer mushroom masala, daal tadka and one peas pulao for the 2 of us Overall the food was really good but would definitely say that the daal was not up to the classical 'dhaba' standards. The food quantity was more than enough for 2 as we had to really over eat in order to ensure nothing is wasted. One partying comment would be that even though traditional bamboo chairs added to the looks it was not that comfortable to sit and eat. :P  Enjoyed the visit and a nice place to discover on the first day of the new year. :D"
3.0,"Have ordered once from here.  The first experience from this place was fine but not very impressive.  Had ordered, baby corn dry as starters which was very very spicy. Main course was just fine which included a katha paneer and tata chicken but the level of spice was too much.  Overall the experience was just fine but may not order from here again."
4.5,Ambience is very good.. especially after sunset!! Food is very good and the price is also reasonable. If you go on a weekend you might have to wait to get a table and the service time can also be more.
4.5,Pros: Awesome dhaba type ambience(Try sitting on the khatiya) I tried punjabi dishes and lassi...Taste was good Very good quantity and price wise Try paneer tikka and chicken tikks..It's awesome here  Cons: No cons........ Only thing I felt oil was bit more in Chicken Do Piaza that I ordered....
4.5,"Good, tasty food! I would recommend the pepper chicken if you are a spice lover... The butter chicken is one of the best I've tasted. Will definitely visit again! :)"
4.0,"So I went to this place today with one of my friend. This was my second visit here and it still is the same as it was on the first day when it had just opened up. So as soon as you enter this place, you notice something strikingly different. The seating arrangements, the ambience and the staff are all entirely different if not peculiar as compared to what you've come to expect from restaurants here at Bangalore. Styled exactly what you would call a ""Dhaba"", this place is excitingly familiar if you've been to any of the dhabas on a highway in the northern states of our country. The staff is dressed in ""kurta-pyajama"" and the seats are made of jute and to top it up there's charpais(khatiyas) in the open and it's brilliant. It's truly unique especially if you visit there in the evening.  Anyway, we ordered a lot of items. 1. Lassi(3 of them) 2. Jaljeera(1) 3. Baby Corn Chilli(1) 4. Malai Paneer Tikka(1) 5. Chicken Adraki(1) 6. Veg Kolhapuri(1) 7. Butter Naan(s)(3)  The total bill after ordering so much was only Rs 1001(yeah, no typo there) . That makes me a happy man. :D Anyway, starting with the review of each item  Lassi : Well made, thick and extremely delicious. It's one of the better lassi(s) I've had in Bangalore.  Jaljeera : It was pretty ordinary and nothing striking  Baby Corn Chilli : It was good too and usual. Properly made, crispy and spicy exactly to my liking.  Malai Paneer Tikka : Now , this was quite an amazing dish I would say. With proper amount of malai added to the Paneer Tikka, it was tasty. There were six large paneer chunks with malai and it was quite good. Good job :)  Chicken Adraki : Big large chunks of chicken pieces there too and the gravy was thick and spicy which you would expect going by the name. I liked this too  Veg Kolhapuri : This item was well made and had proper flavours in every bite. An assortment of various vegetables in proper quantity was a delight.  Butter Naan: I wouldn't say I was disappointed but I wasn't impressed at all either. They were a little hard to tear apart and not quite good. A naan has to be soft so that it tears apart easily.  Anyway, I liked this place and I'm definitely coming back  Ambience : 4/5 Taste     : 4/5 Value for Money : 5/5 Total     : 4.3/5"
4.0,"I went to ccdd to have dinner on Sunday evening.  The place was not so  crowded as we reached early.  It has out door as well indoor seating.  The decor is of a North Indian dhabba,  which is quite appealing.  I ordered sweet lassi and paneer tikka to start of.  Lassi was really good with the hint of  cardamom.  Paneer was fresh and tender.  Right amount of species and worth trying.  For main course I ordered butter chicken and butter nan.  Butter chicken was good too.  The place is reasonably priced.  Will visit again."
4.0,"Well in Bangalore if you are out for a dinner on a weekend then assume the waiting time of at least half an hour. This was my first visit to CCDD although I am staying in the same vicinity.I was being told to wait for half an hour as expected. But the staff cooperated as I had an infant with me and got my call bit quickly.The waiting area is clumsy and very suffocating.  Ambience : Its a village set up with mudda's and khaat's. It looks good but seating for a long time is uncomfortable.  Food : I ordered malai paneer tikka as the starter and found it decent. 6 large pieces of paneer were there which were really soft and tender.It had good amount of capsicum,onion and tomatoes which I think is a must to make any tikka sumptuous.Then on side there was a decent amount of lachcha onions which were tasteful.  Main course : I had ordered only daal makhni along with tandoori roti. Although the daal tasted good but it lacked the authenticity of makhni daal. Rotis were good in size and two are sufficient for dinner.All n all it was a decent visit but would like to try other options next time."
4.5,"One of the best restaurants. You should visit atleast once. You would be mesmerised by its taste and ambience, so as I. Don't leave without having sweet lassi."
4.0,"This place is impressive.. The food, the ambiance, the service everything.. It does take some time for the food to be served but it tasted great.. We had tandoori chicken, paneer tikka, butter chicken, butter naan and methi malai mutter.. Everything tasted good and up to what we expected from the place.."
3.5,"Dhaba ambiance is good ... Young crowed .. Sitting chairs are not comfortable  to enjoy the food . Sawariya kabab ,afghani kabab , lime juice .... Good"
1.5,"After checking great reviews by most people and the high rating of this place had been here for dinner. We had great expectations from this place because as per most of the reviews people were not just singling a few dishes but looked like whatever they ordered was just great. And with that in mind we ordered the Veg sheekh kabab, paneer kofta curry,masala coke, jaljeera, missi roti, tandoori roti.  The sheekh kabab failed to impress us. The salad served with the sheekh kabab was made perfect .The jaljeera was made right as per my friend who is a jaljeera enthusiast. I liked my masala coke. The paneer kofta curry again failed to hit any note whatsoever. The tandoori roti was cold too soon and uninteresting to have because of the reason but was thin and crispy just as commented by one of the reviewers. The missi roti was good.  Ambiance: The ambiance is quite good with traditional khatiyas and seats , brass jugs and steel plates etc.   The quantity is less but for the price it is expected for bangalore standards.  The service is attentive."
5.0,Any body out there who wanna spend a  weekend night with a class food ???? with a homly feel and in a open place?? .. Please visit this place. Forget bout the price and order foods untill your tummy is full ;) been here once and wanna visit again . 5 stars !! GOOD
4.0,Eat all you can and forget about the bills...That's the USP of this place.Been here twice with friends. Food quality is nice.One must try lassi for sure.Also chicken angara is a must for spicy food lovers.Go for phulka in breads. The place also has a open air area for those who love to have a pure dhaba experience on a cot. So overall a nice and budget friendly place to enjoy with friends.
4.0,"Oh! This place is awesome. Dont go looking for ambiance, service, live music et cetra. Go to this place if you want spicy and sumptuous food. The good old college stuff and the place is light on your pocket. What we tried was : 1. Lemon Chicken (4.5 on 5) 2. Stuffed Mushroom ( 4.5 on 5) 3. Chicken Butter Masala (4 o 5) 4. Kadhai Paneer (3.5 on 5) And the Sweet Lassi. The service is swift but the place tends to get a lil hot in the afternoon, since the kitchen is not in a separate area. But i assume the place will be really good during the evening time as they have an open area with lanterns and charpais."
4.0,This place really has good ambience with the feel of sitting on charpai and having food gives the justification to the name. Food is good and pricing is quite reasonable.
4.0,"This village is really made with the dhaba concept in mind. I really love the outdoor seating with the jute mats sort of beds to sit. The outdoor seating is a really nice place with dim lights. The place is always crowded, so table recommendation is a must. I have been here about four times, so I really don't know what to suggest. But I have never had a problem with their food. I really love their chicken chilly, chicken mirchiwala and the chicken tikka masala. The best place about this place is their spicy food. So.people who can't eat spicy should ask them to make it according to their taste. I know this place is a little expensive and also the food quantity is less. I just hope they look into it to the town's standards. It's a nice dhaba ambiance which is always crowded and serves spicy food"
4.0,I liked the ambience.. I liked the feel of sitting on charpai and eating the food .. Typical dhabe ka mahaul .. I dont have this great opinion about the food .. But its worth going atleast once!
3.0,Food is tasty but only thing is that ..its very Ooiillyyyy...
3.5,Again a bit hyped up place. Food is definitely above average but not worth waiting for an hour to get in; which is typically the case over weekends. Lassi there is good.
3.0,"Chulha chauki da dhaba is for the ""haven't cooked today and want to eat out"" people and them who are always on the lookout for the north indian taste.   It has to offer all the top of mind north indian dishes that you can jot down on paper.   The place gives you a nice dhaba feel. Can turn into a nice dinner hangout amongst friends.   Try the butter chicken.  Very rich and very yummy!!"
4.0,"Went here for a dinner wiht friends on sunday night, had a awful experience as they had a waiting of 45 minutes,  But it was worth that wait as the food was delicious, do taste dal tadka with ghee here and the Sweet lassi in kulhad/  Must visit place."
4.0,"Good food, gives a good Dhabha feel with traditional seating. Make sure you pre book your seats because this place is crowded even on weekdays."
4.5,"One of the awesome place to visit in AECS LAYOUT. Food wise it's worth going ... Few things are really good .. There Kalmi kabab , tandoori items are damn good in taste.. CCDD tikka's are yum to have. Deserts though less in number but good in taste.visited 4-5 times there ...  One thing I want to suggest CCDD people dat if you fill lassi in Kulhad n then keep kuhlad for refrigeration.you people are doing this reverse manner .. Bcoz of that people are unable to get flavour of Kulhad along with lassi.. (Which makes lassi a delight to have) . Rest all is fine.  Thanks for providing Punjab's food flavour in Bangalore ????????????"
4.5,"As the name suggest, the ambience gives you a feel of Dhaba . With dim lights and traditional sitting arrangement including khaats , i would rate ambience 3/5 as sitting arrangement is not so comfortable and providing the amount you pay you expect an overall comfortable experience.  Coming on to the food, its a bliss. Till now i have tried Tandoori chicken, Seekh kabab ...the chicken was juicy and properly cooked. With thick gravy and being spicy, chicken tikka masala is one of the dishes that will open your pores.  A must try for spicy food lovers.  Note: My rating is solely based on the food experience."
4.5,Good ambience with equally good food. Paneer starters are really yummy. Main course offers a good variety even for vegetarians. Beware if you are going there on a weekend as getting parking space is not easy around this hotel
3.5,Great food with loads of options and very reasonably priced . Nice dhaba type seating dim lights created the perfect ambience. The sweet lassi is a must try.
2.5,"I have been to this restaurant twice. So I think that it is a good time to submit a review of my experience. Firstly, the quantity served is generous and would easily suffice for two. However, the reason I have them a lesser rating is because of their inability to understand customer's taste and make the food accordingly. I ordered chana masala and paneer khurchan. I specifically asked for less spicy food because I was accompanied by my 4 year old daughter. However, when the food was served it was a different story altogether. Chana masala was very spicy and had green chillies added to further increase the hotness of the dish. It was very difficult for us to finish our food.  When I politely raised this issue with the manager while billing then he very adamantly informed me that they will not alter the taste or preparation of the dish. I felt that this is unfair since I should have been informed while ordering about this so I could have avoided ordering such spicy food altogether."
4.5,Best north Indian food in Whitefield and pretty cost effective too ........Do try and get a reservation though because it gets a little crowded at peak lunch and dinner hours .........one of the few places which are equally great for vegetarians and non vegetarians
3.5,"I finally made it to this place after ""FIVE ATTEMPTS"". Yes, don't get surprised. The place is always crowded which made me to be even more curious to know what keeps them crowded round the clock. Their food is authentically delicious. Right from starters to the desserts, everything tastes so good. The butter milk which they serve is awesomely refreshing. Only problem we had was with the seating. Otherwise, all good. If you're around Brookefields, do visit this place for sure."
4.0,"It happened to be a week day & our tummies were wrecking havoc. Having visited most of the ""BETTER"" places we tried our luck to crash at some other place.  Of course it was a hunger that would only be satisfied with large bowls of Sabzi & Daal and some good desserts but we were unwilling to compromise on quality. Amazed at first on how had we missed on this before.. We went in for CCDD. Food is AUTHENTICALLY LIPSMACKING.. And we cried out loud.. Finally we had a replacement for Kesar/Golkonda Chimney.  We ordered Veg Kolhapuri (spicy) and Methi Malai Paneer ( for my sweet toothed partner) and butter naan. Sabzis are a delight and LASSI is a must although I would recommend 2 to go for 1 coz it is EXTREMELY thick!  Minus: Naans were a little tough to chew. The best part that after so much... Ended up paying only 600 bucks which was in my opinion to less for the quality offered.  PS: theme is good.. Food is better!"
3.5,Have been wanting to go to this place for a long while but have also turned back after seeing the long queue. Made it for lunch one day. The masala papad was crispy but a tad too spicy. The jaljeera has a little too much salt. The sweet lassi was perfect. The veg diwani handi was yummy - creamy and mildly spiced. The rotis were just the way I like them - crisy and thin. The phulka was a bit too thick though. The service was courteous.A good place for lunch or dinner considering the fact that Brookfields has very few moderately priced North Indian restaurants.
3.5,"CCDD, thats what we named it when I used to go to their JP Nagar Branch, and yes, I loved the food at their other branch, but this was simply not just the same Chulha Chauki da dhaba!  The ambiance was almost similar to the JP Nagar branch, being on a roof top, you surly enjoy this place. The food quality was however poor as compared to the other branch. The sabzi's were simply not cooked well, and you would not love it after waiting for almost 30 minutes for table and then 30 more for the order. The food surly could have been better, Please do not lower the quality and cook time just because you want to process more orders.  Whatever it is, It all ends at CCDD with their famous Lassi which covered up for most of their loopholes.  Hope to see you guys at your best when I visit you again!"
4.0,"Its a decent place with nice theme and ambience. The seating arrangements and the deco. goes with the name ""chulha choki da dhabha"". Visited there on a weekend place was packed had to wait to get in. But the service is good so waiting time is less.This place is averagely priced. Now coming to food, though not a very long list of dishes but was decent options available. The starters were good but the main course was the real deal and specially when u get a homely touch phulka inaddition of tandoori roti makes it even better. Loved the food and was quiet light on pocket so whats better then that.  Food- 4.5/5  service 3.5/5  Ambience- 4/5(accordng to the touch the wants to create they are quiet successful in it)  Music - 3/5(need to refine the songs instead of playing the whole albums of every bollywood movie)"
4.5,"Wonderful punjabi village like ambience, cots, oil lamps and unpaved walls welcome you to this place. It remains quite packed even on a weekday. Went there for a friend's treat.  We ordered chhaach which was really authentic tasting. The paneer tikka was good and spicy. Later the dal makhni and Malai kofta tasted superb. After a long time I had nice tasting tandoori rotis and butter naans in bangalore. The friends who ordered tandoori chicken also considered it one of the best tasting in the city so far. The service was quick and staff courteous.  This is one place I am think of visiting more often to get real taste of punjabi dhaba food."
4.0,"Food is awsome like it's environment with a reasonable price tag. Recommended for every food lovers. Go & grab the MALAI KABAB, CHICKEN AFGANI & LASSI."
4.0,"Amazing place.. The food is really great, Beautiful north Indian style dhaba. The Non Veg dishes were just Mesmerizing. :)   Starters I must say not the best ,but was indeed very good. But the fulka curry combination was just a beauty. Friend who was veggie was not pretty impressed with the starter dish which was promised to be spicy but turned out to be bad, but they were kind enough to change the dish when told them it was not as told or expected. The Chicken starters were very good. Kalmi Chicken a Must have !!   The Service was good. Amazing food. Very Friendly to the Pocket. In simple word must try. :)"
3.5,"We discovered this place by accident on a rainy day when it was simply impossible to reach another restaurant that we had planned to go to due to all the water logging on the streets.  As far as the location goes, this is a hidden gem in aecs layout located on 3rd floor of a building, so unless you are looking up in your quest for food, you won't notice it.   Food- 4/5 Ambience-3/5 Service-3.5/5   They have a good spread of north indian (read Punjabi) food. The preparation is good and I really loved the food. The service is quick and the staff is efficient.   The only thing lacking is that they have just one mushroom dish for veg main course. This is hardly something to complain about, nevertheless, it is worth mentioning."
3.5,"I would like to serve the review for food as palatable. Especially veg section will roll over non-veg in race of taste and spice level. Non veg seems to be in line and well enough in taste to be eligible for review, Service is as good during weekday and queued in during peak hours/weekend. Ambiance need to be managed during rush hours. Overall review in line ""worth place to move on for dinner""."
4.0,Nice place with awesome north indian food food. Reasonable prices and lovely ambiance. The service was good though its a bit crowded but still 5-10 mins of wait is fine.
4.0,As usual they best at their cooking ...Recently visited for friend birthday party had nice food ..enjoyed the food but they need to find solution for long waiting queues :-p..
4.0,"Good north Indian food option in Whitefield ( AECS Layout). Nice Dhaba style, good flavours!!! Quantity is little less, however flavours compensate for that."
3.0,"The ambiance here is quite nice. It has the feel of a quaint rustic dhaba. The positives end here. The food is below average n starters r atrociously inedible. Sometimes too sour, sometimes too spicy n other times just bland. The only redeeming thing was the lassi I had.. Which was one of the best I ever had."
4.5,Traditional interior design attracted me to dine here. The service was quite fast and the items were yummy.  We do have the  value for the money spend here in terms of quality and quantity!!
3.5,"I went to this place in a group of four on a Saturday Evening and the place was totally packed.  After waiting for 15-20 minutes, we were shown to our ""table"". Certainly not the table in its original sense, as this place has two seating options in the normal table, or the Khaat/Charpoy, and we chose the latter.  The place could use some ventilation, because as soon as you enter the place, you'll feel a little stuffy.  After settling down, we ordered Kalmi Kabab, CCD Special Tikka, Chicken Lahori, Veg Shahi Korma, Garlic naan and Tandoori Roti alongwith Lassi and jaljeera to wash these down with.  The Service is fast, and the starters arrived pretty quickly.  I was very surprised when the Kalmi Kabab arrived, as it was a plate full of Chicken Legs instead of the Thigh Pieces. I like both, so I did not complain.The Kabab was rightly spiced, and was cooked to perfection. The gang loved it :)  The CCD Special Tikka was a huge disappointment though. It was nothing but Paneer Tikka, with the spices replaced by some sweet marinate which tasted awful.  The Chicken Lahori was what it should've been. Nothing exceptional, just the right fare.  Again my vegetarian friends were hugely disappointed in what was served as the ""Shahi Veg Korma"".The Dish was Sparkling White in colour, and we were confused at first if it was some Complimentary Kheer that they were serving ... !!! The people next to our Khaat had also ordered the same dish, and seeing the confused look on their faces we figured we were not the only ones confused :D  So, a few jokes later about the Kheer ( Veg Shahi Korma ), we took to the Lassi and the Jaljeera.  The Lassi was again, very Okay, but the Jaljeera tasted extremely watery and flavourless.  All in all, it was a mixed experience. The vegetarian fare was distasteful, but the Non Vegetarian Items were quite good.  Pros: Non-Veg food is good, Prices are very affordable, No VAT/Service tax on the bill, Fast Service  Cons: Wrong dish served under wrong name (Kalmi Kabab and Kheer) :D, Stuffy Dining Hall.  However I'd recommend this place to people :)"
2.5,"Nice ambience, decent service, wide variety of choice in the menu, but very average food. We ordered lollypop manchurian, malai chicken and punjabi chicken masala. Each of the dish had some sweet taste to it, didn't like it at all. Lassi was average, Pan was good."
4.0,A really affordable place for having North Indian food. It's well maintained and the service is quick. The food tastes great. The ambience is very rustic. The lassi and chaas are available in kulhad which can make you feel you are at a real dabha. Worth the money you spend. Also heard that their paan is good. Didn't get a chance to try it.
4.5,"First salary treat to parents.. They loved the food. Though we had 40mins waiting period, but that helped to build up the hunger , which was completely satisfied by the food. Awesome taste. Try the lemon chicken for starters."
4.0,"Good food, ambience is also nice. Pricing a little on the higher side but value for money. Getting a table will take 20-30 minutes on weekends in peak hours. Home delivery will take at least an hour on weekends."
4.5,"Creamy lassis, perfect bhurjis, perfectly round& soft ghee topped pulkas... best ever punjabi food ive had.. would recommend to anyone anyday"
4.5,"This place will remind u of the rajasthani n hariyanvi ""Mudda""...ambience is coool...n if u wanna sit in open while rain is pouring on the roof top n eating hot food is the awesome Xperience that u will not get anywhere else..  Food service is too good... Loved the stuffed paratha...n luccha paratha.."
4.5,"This is one of the better North Indian food places in Bangalore.  The ambiance is very much like a road-side dhaba from North, so the place gets full marks for that. But the place is somewhat crowded. As for the food, it was just awesome! We ordered phulkas, naan and tandoori roti in breads, all of which were very soft and good to eat. The curries had authentic Punjabi feel to them, the paneer was soft and fresh. For people looking for non-spicy food, the Aloo-jeera was brilliant! In sides, the Lassi was extremely fulfilling. Also, the service is fast, though the waiters are too busy to take re-orders, so you might want to decide what you want to eat in one go and order. For girls, we ate a lot! But the place is reasonable, (total amount turned out a little over 800 for 4 people), and the food was so good that we finished it all in 15 minutes! The one thing that totally stood out was the paan we had at the end of the meal. Hats off to the paan guy!  A must-visit if you are looking for genuine North-Indian ghar ka khana in Bangalore. Ambience: 4.5/5 Food: 4.5/5 Paan: 5/5 Overall: 4.5/5"
4.0,"Really great food. Love the lemon chicken and the mushroom chilli.  The Veg Kolhapuri is a nice gravy. Most of their chicken starters are good.  Biryani is not great here.  Do try the Kulhad Lassi.. It is very good.  Service is slow during peak times. And not sure how comfortable the place can be during the summers, since there are no ACs."
3.5,"Bit costly but it worth as the food taste pays u back.... try chicken kabab, lassi,baby corn manchurian, biriyani... ! Ambience s perfect for dinner not for lunch..."
3.5,"Being near my home, had to try this out.First thing for the ambiance, they have tried to make the most of the place they had. laying down cots and furnishing the entrire place to give you a dhaba experience.The food also brings you the feel of a dhaba. Typical punjabi dishes to choose from. And almost all worth the money that you will be paying. Some dish to try from are:- Palak paneer, malai kofta, chicken butter masala, and the kababs.One thing that was a let down was the service. Very slow. By the time you have the food at your table, half your will be gone.Overall:- FOOD-4/5 AMBIANCE-4/5 SERVICE-2/5"
4.5,We went for a home delivery on a lazy saturday and were pleasantly surprised with the food. The butter chicken was really good - Very punjabi! The home delivery service matched the promised time.
5.0,"A simple place with a decent ambiance and good food. I had been here with my office colleagues for lunch. We ordered Chicken Lollipop, Chilly Paneer and Chicken Do Piaza. The chicken was cooked really well and all the dishes we quite tasty. To top it all, the menu had the option of Phulkas which made us feel at home. (Usually, this option is not found in most of the restaurants). The quality and quantity of food is very good. It is value for money. Nothing extraordinary about the service. Just like any other restaurant. To sum it up, we had a pleasant and full filling lunch."
4.0,Want a have a lovely romantic dinner? Or a get together with friends. This place is has got both beauty and d food.  +1 from my side
4.0,"One of the finest dining places here in bsngalore, with an amazing ambience. The theme of the restsurant is that of the rural areas where you can dine under the stars over a cot, where service is so good that it gives you a homely feeling. A bit costly but totally worth it."
4.5,"very good place if u want to hv good finger lickin north indian food. the menu provides good range of food to choose from and once u hv the food at ur table, der s nothing else u will concentrate upon apart from the food.  Ambience: 3/5 : they hv tried to give village type of feel. the seating is on village kind of stools, which were not the most comfortable stools. apart from tht nothing much to complaint or praise about.  Food: 5/5: food is a winner here. delicious delicious and delicious. authentic north indian food, you just overeat here. :)  Service: 4/5 : the staff is very very polite. if u joke wid them they will tk it in sporting way. the service time could get a bit better. otherwise no complaints.  VFM: definitely  Verdict: If u hv not been here, den definitely a must try."
4.5,went there last sunday. I like the Dhaba style theme. Nice ambience. Had ordered veg food. It was nicely cooked. Nice service. Overall good experience.
3.0,"Alright, first things first, this place hasquite the expected ambience. It hasan urban feel with arustic blend. Dim enough lights and warm enough interiors to make it feel like a wannabe urban Dhaba.I ordered: Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani with Tandoori Rotis. The Tandoori Chicken was extremely succulent and quite flavorful. The only thing lacking was a little sprinkle ofchaat masala on top and a little heat from spices (for the extra kick)and a pinch of salt in the marinade.The Butter Chicken(apparently the specialty)was screaming for seasoning and a little more apparent spices (I'm being generous with my description here). I would have preferred my Dal Makhani to be a little more cooked. Having said that, I still likedwhat I ate, though I was not very impressed. It had texture, flavor (somewhat there), and the right kind of feel on the palate. The staffwas friendly and the service was very good.  Final Verdict: They have what it takes to go the Premier League, but they are not there yet by a long margin."
4.0,Great food and Lassi :-)
5.0,"Very nice place, awesome food. I would recommend to try Aloo paratha and lassi.  Some of the items to look for is Bhindi masala and ghee roti. Yummy it is....."
4.5,Love the food. Specially the starters.
3.0,"It is what it says - a place that serves dhaba like food in a dhaba like ambience. So I've been to this place twice n ordered home delivery twice. Their service all 4 times was fine by me ( I kept my expectations pretty average), but what they could work on is the quality of their food. All it takes is to order two different chicken/paneer dishes to realize that the gravy base ain't as different as you imagined (it ain't any different at all). So its one of those places for me which I go to/order from if I really don't have too many options."
4.0,"Went there for a friend's birthday treat so cannot comment in the prices, but the decor was very well done with a nice rustic feel to it. The food was well cooked and no issues with the service either. A little far from my place,  so not sure if I would go there again but definitely on my list."
3.5,Good ambience to give you the feel of a dhaba. Do try out reshmi kebab in starters. I found the butter chicken too sweet but otherwise the food is good and in surplus amounts!
2.5,It is a pocket friendly place where u get decent food but have to wait for long hours. The ambience is good but not so spacious.
4.0,This restaurant is good value for money. Its a nice place to take friends out for a treat. The food is very good but the service is tad below average. Think every one should try the masala papad to start of the meal and end on a mango lassi note.
4.0,Tasty food ... Quick service and very reasonably priced. Great option for both veg and non veg ... For a casual meal.
5.0,"Food - Amazing, generous servings Service- quick and efficient, helpful staff eager to assist wit h any requests Value for money - 5/5 We ordered palak paneer and were surprised to have the curry filled with paneer for every bite. A good hangout place for family and friends."
4.0,Very tasty food..good service...place is small with dhaba sitting. Last but not least very decently priced .
4.0,Starting with the amazing chicken kababs.. Till rhe mouthwatering kulhad lassi.. Each n every bite is worth dying for
3.5,"Food, Ambience is awesome! Only drawback is when you go as a gang of 10+, there is no big space to accommodate."
1.5,"After reading good reviews, went to this place with my family. And trust me, was disappointed!!! I called them on Sun evening for reservation but was told it's first come first served and will be fine if I be there at 8pm. Was there around 8.10pm and it was a chaos. They were so many waiting outside, near the lift. The guard was allowing groups who came after us and had to scream and yell to get inside after 40min wait. Ambience is okay but seating is pretty bad. There is not enough space for you to keep legs while sitting on the stools and had bad back ache whole time. It was too noisy. Food was average, nothing great. Will not recommend this place. My ratings Reservation/ Getting in 0/5 Ambience 2/5 Seating 1/5 Service 2.5/5 Food 2.5/5"
3.5,"Their service was quick considering weekend night and food was also good but bigger  disappointment was they neither serve beer nor soup , so I had nothing to wash down starters with."
4.0,"Went to this place for a casual dinner on a normal evening. Did not have much expectations from it. But when we entered, it took me instantly to a punjabi dhaba replete with the khattiyas and the lanterns and everything! Even being a vegetarian, the menu was quite a spread. Not too exotic, your normal dhabbe da menu, very filling and tasty. The starter as well as the main course were good. Don't miss the jaljeera. Brilliant after a tadkedaar meal! Plus it's at a walkable distance from my place or for any techie near ITPL. Rates are also very very reasonable. Do give this place a try :)"
3.5,Great ambience and service. Average food. Good place for dinner.
3.5,"CCDD - Some decent dhaba fare.  Having passed by this place a number of times (I live down the road of course), I had always been tempted, hoping to find some amazing dhaba style food to feast on. I finally got the chance to give it a shot today, with some hungry souls looking for some North Indian.  The ambience tries to recreate a roadside dhaba, though there is a roof. The chairs are jute stools, with matching tables layered with a glass top (I think this added to the prices here :P). Service is average and the staff can sometimes forget you during the rush hour. We managed to find a table with ease at dinner time on a Sunday night.  Lots of food was ordered. The 'Chicken 65' was average, and all you could taste was the spiciness; it had around 12 boneless pieces, and I feel that the quantity is not value for money, neither is the taste. The other starter was the 'Tandoori Malai Chicken' - this dish was outstanding, with the perfect tandoori chicken doused in the flavourful creamy paste, absolutely bursting with flavour; the 8 portions were also generous; dish of the day for me. The 'Paneer Tikka' was also good (6 tikkas on a plate). On to the main course. The 'Chicken Punjabi', which was delicately spiced with green chillies (garnished with them as well) and had good subtle flavours, with a rich onion gravy; had 4 pieces which was a pleasant surprise as most restaurants don't go beyond 3). The Dal Makhni was again decent, and slightly unsalted, though the consistency on it was good and decently flavoured. The Malai Kofta was good, with a thick slightly sweet (as expected) gravy and soft koftas. The 'Butter Nan' was well done, and the portions were pretty massive. 5 people ordered a butter nan each, and there were leftovers still. 'Sweet Kulhad Lassi' reminded me of Amul srikhand (flavourwise), and was a good accompaniment to the meal (I'd still recommend coke though).  All in all, do give this place a try if you are in its vicinity, especially for the Tandoori Malai Chicken.  Ambience: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Food: 3.5/5 Value for Money: 3.5/5 Recommendation: Tandoori Malai Tikka"
4.5,"Hmmm.. Hmmm..Yumm... Finger licking good!  Went there with family over the weekend for a lunch... typical dhaba style (Shack, open kitchen, bamboo furniture).... Food was awesome... Finger licking good!!! This is definitely one of my favorites from now on. We ordered Veg. Kofta, Rajma Masala, Veg Briyani and Chilli Aloo.... it was yummmm.... really enjoyed it! The service was also very fast and good! Eagerly awaiting the next visit!"
3.5,"Wanted to give a try after reading many positive reviews, indeed it exceeded my expectations. Juicy kebabs loved it, the menu list just goes on an on to be it veg or non veg. Surprised to see the Chinese items were tastier than any other Chinese cuisine outlet(esp Chicken 65). Just one thing i felt bad was the attitude shown by one who took the order, as i was surprised by the hospitality of others who attended other tables. I haven't considered this for the rating as it is just for the quality and taste of the food. Definitely would love to visit Chulha Chaiki Da Dhaba again.... More importantly its value for money!!!  Reducing the rating for the bad experience if stale food served during my last two visits it was indeed a big let down, might stop visiting for a while as I can't count down the number of times I have visited in the last one year maybe 50 + times. Not sure if their taste degraded for my taste buds are not really enjoying the food. For sure Need a break."
4.0,"I had been there only for dinners and with friends all the times! Food is very good. All their kebabs are yummy! The place is good with both indoor and outdoor seating options. Service is also good! Every time I am at Brookfield with friends, I will visit this place for dinner."
2.5,"I went for lunch with family. The food was not great , I am talking about the veg food here. Non veg might be good ,i am not sure but veg food was horrible. Ambiance was so so. The place is not so big so if a big group comes for dining it becomes quite noisy ,which happened in my case. Could be improved, specially in terms of food quality ."
1.0,"3 hours for Delivery !!!! 19th July 2014  8:00 Pm - We ordered food and were told food will take 45 minute 9:15 Pm  - On ensuring were told food is ready (Ready and being sent? Should have been delivered by now) 9:45Pm - No food. No response 10:00 Pm - They say he is reaching in couple of minutes  10:15 / 10:20/10:25/ 10:30 / 10:35/ 10:45 - No response or call hang up after saying ""Sir check karke phone karta hoon"" But no               response 11:0- the delivery boy calls and gives a lame excuse of bike puncture. We bike was punctured not ohone. They did not even tell us so. So I am highly suspicious. To add to frustration , he asks for directions 11:20 The food arrives . Not stylishly but disgustingly late. I could have googled recipe, shopped ingredients, marinated nd slow cooked in 3 hours 11:30 TO add to our disgust and frustration, they have conveniently forgotten to send the gravy  Well we stay in India so last 10 lines and 10 minutes spent are of no use as outlet wont even bother.  My Question to Zomato: - How can such local dhabas get added without any checks  - Will any action be taken now by #Zomato . Wil the partner get de listed? yes it is loss of revenue but Zomato can avoid such embarrassment.  - How do foodizens like us get appropriately satisfied that Zomato stand for ensuring we get best of listings and service.   Will any one in Zomato  or partner even see this"
3.0,Nice food. Price is nice. But the place is congested.
4.5,"Small place, good service and very pocket friendly compared to other restaurants nearby. Food was really good. Attempt to create a different ambiance has been somewhat successful but the the chairs are not that comfortable to sit for more than an hour.   If you are bored of going to the same places repeatedly  around Whitefield, then this is definitely worth trying."
3.5,"Hello people....here I give my version of the experience with CCD....this was a take-away order, so I will not be able to comment much on the service and ambience of the restaurant...  The place is near to my house...it is in a building on AECS Layout main road, which has 3 more restaurants...CCD is on top floor, which gives it a better chance to have a good rooftop eat-out....so open rooftop is a good place to have dinner...the inside of restaurant is congested (but it will give a family its space), buzzy and cozy...waiters roam around in a kurta and jeans, adding to the homely ambience....  Next comes the food. We ordered Chicken Makhanwala and Tawa Chicken. Former is a gravy item and latter has no gravy, but enough onion, garlic masala to eat your bread with. Tawa chicken was good in taste, but I have eaten this dish in other restaurants in south India, served as chilly chicken. Chicken makhanwala is not related to butter chicken, and resembles more of chicken kadhai. The preparation was good, but I was looking for a sweet instead of spicy dish, so was a little disappointed. But whats there in the name, as long as you have somebody to explain you the reality... :)  Portions were good and price was decent, not pricey but also not very cheap. Another thing, no sodexho or Amex cards are accepted here.   All-in-all the place is good, food is good...  Enjoy..."
4.0,"Good food. Rooftop place with rustic dhaba style seating. Went there with a friend for lunch. The menu is varied, yet filled with common stuff. Wasting no more of time, coming to food, the curry was flavorful, not very oily and moderately spiced. Paneer wasn't chewy, it was fresh and melt in the mouth. Naans were good, though i was really tempted looking at the fulkas being served on the table next to us. Just wish, the buttermilk had no chillies! Value for money, a place worth going. Not very pretentious."
2.0,Food and the theme was great but service was quite slow. we all together 20 people went with pre booking but sitting arrangements were done only after we reached and they took 20-25 mins for that only which was a big spoiler.
4.0,"It is a cute lil place on rooftop which is highly economical! As soon as you enter the place, you ll see cane all around giving you the feeling of a village arena! Also the lighting adds to the feel! To add it all up, you sit on stools or cots, which is typical dhaba style! I have been there a couple of times and never was any dish lacking in taste! Right from chilli babycorn to masala papad to dal makhani n kadai paneer- everything is delicious! The drinks, lassi and buttermilk were above average!@ Totally worth it!"
4.0,"Wow! Chulha Chauki da dhaba sure knows how to stand out from the numerous eateries in Bangalore. First of all..Amazing theme! Secondly.. amazing adherence to the theme! From the ambience to their cutlery and even their waiters were perfectly adapted to match the infamous Dhaba theme. *Impressed. Coming to the main attraction-food: Loved it!  Set aside the rural ambience, the food is definitely top notch. Perfect taste with compromises in quality. Their lassi was the best Ive had in a long long time.  Their mushrooms were a delight and the parathas.. *_* We ordered 4 glasses of lassi (for 2) 2 parathas and stuffed mushroom tikka and the bill was a mere 500 bucks! We were so full we literally rolled out of the place. This joint has no doubt made a prominent place in my favourites list and I sure will be visiting it again and again. A must go place for northies and southerners will love it too. :)"
4.5,the ambiance ... the food....the service....Absolutely Beautiful
5.0,"Have been here twice and the place has proved itself both the times.  First was a lunch with a couple of friends. We ordered some starters and then tawa chicken with butter naan for the main course. Food was delicious, service was quick and the staffs were very  friendly.  Next, after few months me with my team came for dinner. We took the open area at the roof top and made ourselves comfortable on the cot. The ambience was amazing. We had chicken lollypop, kalmi kabab, babycorn chilli and garlic paneer with some masala papad for starters. For main course we ordered tawa chicken again (its  a must try), malai kofta and butter naan. I must say they were amazing...sll of them.  To end the dining we had some lassi, buttermilk and gulab jamun.   Lassi and buttermilk was okay. I was not expecting something great out of it. But the gulab jamun..again its a delicacy. Perfectly cooked with dry fruits fillings, a mouth melt.  I wonder how they manage to maintain such a quick service. 5 stars from me."
5.0,"Are you a true foodie??  than guys this's it!!  A perfect punjabi food. ,The paneer is cooked to a perfect al dente so that it is still firm yet soft when you bite into it. the gravy is a perfect blend of spices that marry so well you feel an explosion of flavors in your mouth. topped by a sprinkling tadka adds that extra little kick that makes you want to keep eating. the concept is somewot like ""Horn OK Please"". the ambiance is quite earthy to hang on wid your loved once. I'm in fact startled to find such an echt punjabi    hut in this over rated world. jus damn srummmmmmmptios..."
3.0,"A small place on the 3rd floor of one of the busiest streets in Brookfield... Good food, service and ambiance but slow preparation. Try going at night so that you can try the outside seating. It has 3 branches apparently and all have homely food is what o was told. But I could not find much homeliness. I loved the Afghani kabab and chicken 65 (which is not the same as the usual chicken 65 u get elsewhere). Butter naan and tandoori roti were mediocre for a north Indian restaurant. Ghee fulka was good . Curries had excessive masala but  in delivering the right flavor. I tried lasooni chicken and Punjabi chicken - not so happy with what I got. Butter milk was ok-ish. Lassi was good but kesar could have been avoided. Overall I would rate not more than 3."
4.0,"Many a times when a restaurant opens its outlet at a different location, the quality goes down or service is not so great. However that is not the case with Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba.  It was a random plan to visit this place for lunch on a Weekday as the food at work looked really hopeless. Just as JP Nagar one, the ambiance here also is of a pure desi dhaba to eat good tandoori food.   As we were 8 of us, I got a chance to try various items and this time around we ordered for Chilly Paneer, Taandori kebabs, Seekh Kebab Veg, Chicken tikka in Starters. Taandori Kebab and Chicken Tikka is more or less same, the only difference is found was Chicken Tikka was boneless. For Main Course, I would recommend to try Tawaa Chicken with hot Pulkas. It was hot, spicy and well cooked.Butter Chicken Masala is also worth ordering for someone who is a non-spicy eater. Sweet Lassi is a must here along with Papad. The service is a bit slow and can be improved.  Ambiance 3/5 Food 4.5/5 Service 4/5"
3.5,Good Chicken Kalmi kebab. Tadka daal is also good. Unique Dhaba style sitting arrangement in a modern ambience.
3.5,Haven't been to a dhaba in a long while? Haven't got the feel of terrace restaurant in a long time?  Both answers lead to Chulha Chauki da Dhaba.  Went without reservation on a Sunday night. As expected had to wait half an hour.  We didn't manage to get a khatiya but got a window faced table instead.  Amazing view.  Ordered biryani and dal tadka.  The best dal tadka I've ever had in Bangalore. Will totally go again for it.  The only north indian restaurant my flatmate has ever liked in Whitefield among all the restaurants he has visited  The service is a bit slow and disorganized just one person taking all the orders (maybe because it was a weekend)
3.5,"Was there for lunch on a weekday with my team. We were greeted with good ambience, cordial staff and fast service. Starters were hot and spicy. Avoid any Tandoori starters, they aren't really tandoor cooked. Judging by the starters' spiciness don't go easy on main course, order spicier dishes, because the main dishes are deliciously cooked. Don't miss the lassi and the sweet pan from the in-house panwaala.  Overall a nice place to have a ghee-rich, sumptuous and lively lunch with your team/friends."
2.0,"This branch is not good.. Nothing was good as we feel. There were group of 6 people,  no one was satisfied with food quality and service."
4.0,The place is not only good as far as the ambience is concerned but also makes sure that the customers enjoy a great meal. The staff is courteous and the service is prompt. The lamps surely lighten up the mood and the cots give a good dhaba touch.  The place is one which doesn't boast about itself loudly but successfully leaves a mark for itself in your tastebuds and your 'next time visits' list.
3.5,A friend of mines was very impressed by the food here so we decided to hop in once here. The moment i entered it felt like i came to some Rajasthani society with dim yellow lighting and old Hindi songs being played. It has a very unique seating arrangement especially for couples  where you can simply fold your feet and sit plus it has a rooftop. Coming to the food i was not very impressed by the food which we ordered. We had a chicken do pyaza and peas pulao. The chicken was not very good and had a lot of small broken bones in the gravy! Pulao was pretty much OK. I guess the place is better for vegetarians! The staff was good and all of them were dressed in authentic khaki kurtas which added to the ambiance! Maybe i can try Veg food next time!
5.0,Best Afgani chicken in Bangalore
5.0,awesome food!
5.0,"Visited this awesome place around 8 times in the past 1.5 months. Items to have a definite go at :  1. Chicken Tikka (starter) - never had so big, succulent and awesomely tasty 6 pieces of chicken tikka ever..that too for just 209 bucks. 2. Dal Tadka : pure bliss. Hats off to the cook , specially for the tadka. One bowl of dal tadka is sufficient for 6 - 8 phulkas. 3. Phulkas : served hot and soft. Optimum usage of atta and maida, so that even if the phulkas get a little cold, it's not difficult to tear them (unlike most other restaurants where the phulkas can be eaten only when hot of the oven, cz the moment they become cold it feels like u r tearing through a chewing gum).  Seating arrangement and comfort : 5/5 - can be broadly classified into two parts :                                  A. Indoor (with the view of the open kitchen, around 5 to 6 big tables and ""moda' made of cane  seats.                                       O, n don't forget the panwalla making his presence felt in one corner with his mouth watering paans.                                      (20 bucks each - a tad on the higher side).                                 B. Open Air  : 1. Total open air (where u can acutally see the night sky and make urself comfortable on any                                                               of the three 'Khatiyas'. ). Lanterns hang from the bamboo poles on the roof sides giving a                                                              perfect Punjabi roadside Dhaba feeling.                                                          2. Partial Open Air : has 4 tables and 'moda' made of cane as seats placed on white gravel.                                                                                  View of the night sky is blocked by the tile roof above. Overhead small fan is available for                                                                 two of the four tables.    Ambience : 4/5 . They have created authentic dhaba feeling only in the open air roof-top portion of the restaurant, not in the indoor part. There is some scope of improvement in the indoor part in order to provide an authentic dhaba ambience in the indoor part.  Service :  4/5 . Very prompt in taking as well as delivering the order.   Staff courteousness : 5/5 . Very polite, well spoken and well mannered."
5.0,"If I had to describe this place in Just one word, it'd Just be awesome.. to start with. right from the ambience to the food,  this place just hits the right note. I had visited this place for the first time last month when they had Just started it...  and I must say... I was left awestruck after having their 'desi to the core ' offerings. we had kalmi kabab and sawariya kabab for starters, dal tadka, paneer tikka masala and bhendi masala for main course. the kababs were Just as desired.. soft, juicy and mouth watering. the dal was Just yumm and bhendi n paneer were also good. post this awesome experience, I make it a point to visit there at least once a week. trust me it's one of the best places to spend your money on a costly weekend, in the vicinity of Whitefield, since it's reasonable as compared to Bangalore standards. a big thumbs up from my side."
3.5,"After a horrible experience at Bobby Ka Dhaba i vowed to my self never again to step into a dhaba . But as the saying goes promises are meant to be broken and here i was at Chulha Chauki Da Dhabha . Located on the 3rd floor the place with its open kitchen and seating arrangement sets up the right ambiance for a dhaba .   For Drinks we ordered Lassi and lime soda and for starters Swariya Chicken and masala papad . The succulent pieces of chicken just set our taste buds to want more .   Coming to the mains Chicken Punjabi Masala and the butter naan's . They were just right. Overall an awesome experience .   I must say coming to this place at peak office hours the service was almost spontaneous.   For 5 of us the bill came up to 1173 , once again Zomato was bang on right !  Is sure to visit this place in future .."
5.0,"Awesome Awesome just Awesome food.. I had read reviews and was having decent expectations for taste and quality of food..but let me tell you I havent tasted such tasty north indian food in entire bangalore... i think they have an excellent cook out der :) ...mostly have ordered home delivery ... its yummy .. have never  had a dine in der yet.. but before i leave bangalore would def drop in one day fr sure.   i have orderedNaan, tandoori roti, tandoori chicken, paneer kadai ,chicken lollypop so far and let me tell you each dish was mouth watering .. ok let me order food tonite again ;) .. enjoy ccdd food .."
4.0,"Located near Kesar Sweets, this new restaurant is themed like a dhaba (as the name suggests). With both open air and enclosed seating, the place is nicely done. The seats are made from bamboo cane and provide a nice dhaba-like feel to the place albeit with more cleanliness :)  Tried both veg and non-veg dishes and they tasted very good. The panner and chicken was really nice. The quantity is decent for the price they charge.  Loved the Paneer Butter Masala (my all-time favorite dish). Afghani Chicken was good too. The Butter Naan were cooked properly and were soft.  Nice place for a corporate lunch/dinner or a night-out with family or friends. The prices are decent and won't burn a hole in your pocket.  Ambience - 7/10 Quantity of food - 8/10 Quality of food - 8/10 Seating - 8/10 Staff - 8/10 VFM - 8/10"
4.5,"This review is based on the two times I have been to this place already..  We arrived there, a gang of 11, 7 non vegs, 2 veg, one confused..but ultimately had paneer and the gravy from a chicken dish, and one not so hungry.... Some of us had reached earlier to book a couple of tables, so we didnt have to wait outside, this was around 8, and it was crowded outside....and so was the inside too. This place is not meant where you would go, lazily sip lassi and talk with your lover about the golden days, rather this is where you ll go with your gang, talk loud, joke and have fun and eat away.... We ordered the starters as chicken hariyali, chicken afghani , tandoori chicken, paneer tikka, and teo plates of babycorn chillys. Apart from wishing that the baby corn chilly was a little more in quantity, cz it was soooo yummy, there was no complaints from anyone. This was a first....I had the chicken hariyali, afghani and baby corn chilly and i loved them all outright. The hariyali had the rich buttery taste to it, afghani came wrapped in egg, so each bite was chicken+egg....awesome and the baby corn chilly, even though not crispy fried, this one was very lip smacking....The cooks know how to make the snacks damn right!!. For the main course,. we ordered garlic naans, chicken tikka masala and the spiciest that they have there, chicken angara....dont remember the veg ones correctly though so wont try reviewing them... Chicken tikka masala....tasteful and rich. Spices being mixed extremely expertly and the dish was just finger licking nice. Chicken angara...the waiter warned us that this was the spiciest thing they had and the dish lived up to the expectations. It was spicy, it was hot and the taste lingered on... No complaints about the peices in terms of number or quality, pretty decent ones. Now....the reason why this place doesnt get the 5/5 by my book....the waiting time!! The starters arrived within say 10 mins of ordereing while the rest of the order took a good half an hour before they showed up... had to remind our waiter a couple of times...still a very good place to go... Ah, yes, the lassi....simply wow!! Do try it. This place is slightly on the costlier side, by the time we were done with our multicourse meal, we each were poorer by about 350 rs...but this is acceptable...i remember the waiter tell me the first time i went there and told him that it was a tad bit costly, he prompty replied back..sir, you wont come here everyday, but when you do, spend a little, and you wont regret it!! I didnt regret it that day, nor did i do it this time. This place deserves the occasional visits when you want to have good food and are not in the mood to dress up and go to some uptown restaurant and act all posh!!  I loved this place!!"
5.0,"Mouthwatering food,  good ambience. Great hospitality."
4.0,Egg Chilli is out of this world. Do try out their Dal Tadka with Desi Ghee. The feel of a real road side Dhaba with a touch of sophistication is what bring me back to this place.
4.0,"Authentic punjabi food and even better ambience.. dont miss the chicken tikka and lassi here! The open air part is the best, serving the food on a charpai with dim lights all around you really feel as if you're in a roadside dhaba. Hospitality is very good,all waiters are very well behaved and well mannered. While leaving, just try the sweet pan!!"
3.5,"Wow.. Awesome desi interiors it had. Like a good road side dhaba, which u can witness around most of the national highways in North India.  I wished the food could get the same taste as my expectations, but nevertheless it was good.  Service was not that cool. They served us the starters when the main course was already there on table.  Nice experience overall!"
2.5,"went here with a friend, I was visiting this place for the first time. Got some good inputs about them so I was looking forward to this. we ordered lemon chicken, paneer khurchan, and 2 butter naans. portion size of starters was too less as they served only 4 peaces. the main course gravy was not that great. and the naan was a major disappointment because they were like chewing gum. along with all this the seating arrangement is not optimized according to the space, too much squeezed. also waiters were sometimes lost.. so at the end of the dinner I was disappointed with the hard to try but urban dhaba.!!!"
3.0,"Good food, nice ambience. Place is little hot and cramped up. Needs good ventilation."

4.0,"Krishvi Propero, AECS layout, is a stack of 04 restaurants from Jade(d) at the bottom and crowning the complex is Chula Chauki Da Dhaba( CCDD). This is the third CCDD in Bangalore and nice to have one closer home.  Sunday shopping is either prefixed or followed by lunch out-CCDD was chosen for being a new place and secondly expected genuine North Indian food.  For our luck the lift was not working and so trudged up building an appetite and on reaching-a bell rings and to see the lift door opening-GRRRRRR!.  Located on the terrace it was divided into the open section and the cooler interiors. The open section had an artificial lawn with charpoys with synthetic rope brightly colored. The interior had these Moorahs for seating and these huge ones topped with glass that acted as tables. There was an open kitchen with the chefs toiling away making variety of breads. All and all they tried their best to conjure the dhaba atmosphere which was achieved to an extent.  We were attended to immediately with a Menu that had a fare that restricted itself to the North. Asked for:- a)	Lassi-nice taste but watered down. b)	Lime juice soda-this was great. c)	Chicken Pudina-it came in a small container (dekshi) without the frills of presentation but a dish that was worth every penny. The chicken was tender and soaked in the accompanying juices. Pudina was not overpowering but the taste lingered. There was this hint of hing which lent it a pleasant taste that is only found in our villages. The quantity was sufficient for two. A dish would recommend all to try. d)	Dal Makhni-The dexterousness and capability of a North Indian chef can be gauged by this dish. Full marks to him/her-wonderful better than some snazzier places in Whitefield. e)	Fulkhas-light, fluffy and well baked drizzled over with an aromatic desi ghee, added to the total experience. CCDD is an excellent example of where subdued use of chilies can bring out the flavors of the other ingredients and not kill every dish with a handful.  For us CCDD was a great experience for the tasteful food, attention and honest prices.  Will rate it a 4.  PS: - A review is an individual take on his or her experience of a restaurant on a particular occasion/time/dish ordered and so many variables being involved but I get comments questioning the sagacity of my review (ratings) from a few fellow Zomatians??"
1.0,"Very poor food and slow service. The ambience is OK, but can get stuffy. They prefer making for deliveries first rather than for the people in the restaurant itself."
