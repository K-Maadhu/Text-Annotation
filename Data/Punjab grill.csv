A perfect place to hangout with family / friends either for official corporate lunch or dinner . We were here for dinner, we started with the cocktails drinks which had offered first Jagger bomb, cosmopolitan, daiquiri. Vini served us masala Papad with green chutney with compliment. Starters was a non Veg kebabs where we got different verity of authentic flavours of spices .. Main course was nalli ghost, Tandoori roti which had a finger lick taste more over very delicious... Finally ended up with a kulfi falooda and pan shots where we had never tried ... Must try North Indian Punjab Grill restaurant we got in Orion ... We are very thank full to chef who cooked us good delicious food and who served us very courteously..."
2.0,"We visited for team lunch. No...not good I must say because of the below reason: 1. The food is not good in taste as per they claim. Like the name ""Punjabi"", there is no Punjabi flavor i.e. Punjabi Tadka in their food 2. The options available for starters are far far less.  3. Prawns are not being served always. Good to call and then check the menu before hitting the place. 4. Mutton sis not present wither in started or in the main course. 5. In main course, the options are far less again (One chicken dish, one fish dish and one chicken Biriyani....and that is it)  7. Not at all worth for the money  8. Highly advice not to visit unless you have no other option to eat  Please do call the restaurant and check the menu before you visit the place in person.  Thanks!"
5.0,It is one of the best north indian restaurent what i was looking for. and i got that i have enjoyed each and every bite of paneer tikka multani and Murgh tikka punjab grill.and special thanks to niraj who made our day special with polite and Humble thank you niraj. We will come again sure
3.0,"Visited for dinner. We ordered vegetarian food only. Started with Paneer Ka Soola which was very ordinary in taste and only good thing about it was that they give big pieces. Then we had Bharwaan Kumbh Peshaawari. It was unique, made up of mushroom and stuffed with paneer. In main course, Tandoori Roti with Dal Makhaani. In Dal Makhaani, I hardly found any razma pieces and it was overloaded with butter! In mocktails, we had Swad Cranberry Margarita, Rim Jhim Mojito and Mango Bite Ginger Beer. Pan shot was viscous which I didn't like. Ambience is superb, staffs are very polite and courteous. Choice of background music was depressing though! Unnecessarily overpriced!"

They were talking about someone shot 3 people with gun, my parents are BJP supporters, etc etc. Then waiters were too interested in these people as if they have become the family members of these customers. All over experience => Non sense  Will not visit again to this place again.  Good points : Quality of food -> 4/5 Ambience -> 4/5 during starters, 1/5 during after starter."

5.0,"Excellent service Mr.Sabuj ...food is good ,ambience and music was very good .Treatment Hospitality is excellent.........defently visit again punjab grill orion mall."
4.0,"Definitely a must visit place for any foodie who loves North Indian cuisine. They have both a buffet as well as an a la carte option and we chose the latter.  A word of warning that their breads are much bigger than the average sizes you would get served in restaurants at Bangalore. One naan cut into three pieces is adequate for one person as they are big and thick.  The paneer butter masala thankfully was not the tomato based curry that gets passed off at most joints but had the distinct cashew tase in it as it should be.  The kebab platter has options of fish, chicken and mutton as is a real treat for foodies who love both boneless and boned kebabs.   Service thought needs to be slightly improved.  Cheers,"
5.0,Food was outstanding.. Specially mutton sheek kabab.. And our today's host bishwajit was very friendly and polite an extra thumbs up for him..

4.0,"Inside Orion mall, when you wanna get away from the good court and you just wanna go back to the North, this is the place to be . Their Dal Makhni is the best, in the world, and is a must have. The pan shots that they give you complimentary are also amazing   The best part was the tray in which they served saunf, adding a picture for the appreciation. Keep up the good quality guys !  VFM - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5 Food - 4/5"
3.0,Had bhatti da murgh & murgh tikka punjab grill. Both were good but not worth the price. I ordered thinking it will be something special but turns out not so. This place is expensive.

5.0,"Awesome food, good songs. Umesh has been very cortauseous. Rasmalai is awesome here, must try. The ambience is also nice. Must visit place for lunch and diner"
4.0,"Good food, high price, good service but much more to be desired in terms of ambience ! The restaurant plays good music : a rarity these days but the tables are very closely kept and the chatter of the customers is pretty loud at times. For such a premium restaurant, that doesn't give a very good vibe. The food is pretty steeply priced but the quantity is very good, in fact surprisingly good. The restaurant also serves papad, onion and green chutney in the beginning. As starter we had Bhatti da Murg : very well done ! It was very succulent and juicy and the flavours were pretty good. Through tandoor flavour was coming well through and we loved it. There were 6 pieces. In the mains we had Patiala shahi macchi. It was also well done with a tangy taste. The fish was very soft and well cooked. Will recommend both the dishes. The quantity of the mains was also pretty good and we had to get it packed for home. Punjab grill does a good job of packing too, seeing that many folks get stuff packed. For breads we had Amritsari kulcha and Laccha paratha. The kulcha was pretty big in quantity and could serve 2 people. The Laccha paratha was also big and made of whole wheat, not maida. Diaappointingly the napkins were very tattered and old ! In terms of ambience the restaurant was disappointing and far from its Koramangala counterpart."
5.0,Fantastic experience...Sabuj was very helpful in suggesting the extremely delicious dishes. The non veg dishes were very nicely cooked and juicy and BBQ well enuff. The music and the ambience is perfect for a family dinner.

4.0,"First visit to this place ! Had table reservations done in advance considering its in the mall premises. Ambiance is soothing. Love the lighting and the decor. It was an all vegetarian fare ( though i would love to go back and try non-vegetarian items) this visit - Hara Bhara Kebab was soft and succulent, good bite and consistency. On the mains were Amritsari Malai Kofta and Mushroom Masala - Kofta was made of cottage cheese, khoya, cashew and raisins I believe which gave it a nice texture holding the dumpling together. Mushroom masala had spices and seasoning to perfection. Cocktail was the Vodka based -Cosmopoliton which is my preferred drink wherever i go and no complaints here - made well. Service was good but there were a few hiccups. Order was taken but they kept coming back saying item was not available. Happened with the cocktails and then after the small plates were served and we were waiting for the mains, we were told the dish we ordered which was Khumb Makai Tak a Tak was not available and we had to opt for replacement which then took time to come. Staff should be trained or be informed of the dishes or beverages available and not ask for replacements in between food being served. Other than that it was a good experience. It's a fine dine place and hence pricing is on the higher side.                                             foodntraveldiaries.in"
5.0,"Punjab grill is one of the finest Indian food restaurant in orion mall Bangalore . Punjab grill is very subtle and small restaurant but as they set everything is perfect. Ambience is too pretty (small and cozy). It is a proper family restaurant but you can go with friends if you wanna have good punjabi lunch and dinner. Their music system is also commendable as they were playing romantic songs and they were same as my music play list so I was relating to them and I was feeling very homely.  So I went with my friend to have lunch and I ordered:   Let's start with drinks they serve us 4 drinks (pineapple drink, mango drink, cola sikanji and cucumber sikanji) and I love all of these it was Soo great and perfect in taste. My personal favorite is pineapple drink and cola sikanji.   Veg platter: Veg platter includes methi tikki, paneer tikka and dahi ke kebab. My personal fav is paneer tikka (OMG THAT WAS SOO GREAT)   Non veg platter; It includes three chicken dish and all were too good (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)   Bajra Chaat: Very rare, a restaurant serve bajra related dish because it taste not that much good but it is healthy af. But they serve very yummy Chaat. So highly recommended for healthy and yummy food lover.   Amritsari Fish: It is Soo soft and it will melt in your mouth when you have one bite of it. Now you can imagine how yummy it will be.   Now let's talk about one the best main course: Butter chicken (Recently one of the best), MAA chole ki daal(one of the best), mutton and paneer lababdar served with breads. Recently one of the best main course in Delhi (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)   Then they served aam ras (which was too much sweet if you love then order) and kheer (yummm af)  P.S- Their service was Soo nice and great. their food is commendable.  SERVICE: 5/5 FOOD: 5/5 AMBIENCE: 5/5 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"

The music was quite relaxing and it was all fun while we were waiting for our food to arrive. We ordered Murg Makhani and Paneer Lababdar along with Chur-chur naan and zafrani naan. The chicken was chewy and wasn't very well cooked. The Paneer was also not soft. Both the gravies were not bad though. The biggest let down was Chur-chur naan which was nothing like it should have been - hardly any butter or taste for that matter. While we were still wondering if we made a mistake ordering, nobody bothered to ask if the food was to our looking, yet a staff (who did not even serve us) came around insisting at least thrice that we review them on Zomato. Well, here you go!"

5.0,"Head to Punjab Grill for the most amazing place The attention paid to the taste, flavors and presentation is commendable. The outlet at Orion is beautiful beyond words. It has a royal touch to it and the entire place is a treat to the eyes. Punjab grill provides you a complete package of Perfect food, amazing service and beautiful ambiance.  We ordered few starters to begin with.  Champ Tejdar : Undoubtedly the best Lamb chops in Bangalore. These succulent and flavorful chops are marinated for a long time and cooked to the utmost perfection. Each bite was such a delight. They were juicy and bursting with flavors. Must must try at Punjab Grill.  Tandoori Lobster : Lobster chunks marinated in a spice, yogurt, onion and garlic mixture and served in lobster shells.Another must have dish when you visit Punjab grill  Mutton Boti : Ghee roast mutton served over tiny slices of kulcha. This was little on the spicy side. It was a blend of tangy and spicy flavors and tasted amazingly delicious as well.  To pair with starters, I had a mocktail called Dhaniya ka patta which was a different take on the usual Mint mocktails served everywhere. Strong coriander flavour with soda, lemon and jeera was quite refreshing.  For the main course, we had Mutton Rarha which is Mutton served with keema gravy. The mutton was again cooked perfectly. Paired with Lacha Parantha, this promises you a hearty meal.  We also tried Malai Jhinga- Prawns in a cream gravy with a tinge of lemon. A different combination of flavors and a light dish to opt for if you are quite full with the starters.  Coming to the exotic dishes that Punjab Grill expertises in, we tried Gucchi Malai curry and Guchhi Pulao. Gucchi are Morels, which are a type of mushrooms that actually contain vast amounts of savoury flavour and are found only in J&k. They totally account for a luxurious dish since they sell at a rate almost at par with Gold. Here at Punjab Grill, these mushrooms are packed with feta cheese and then cooked. It just adds to the existing flavors of the Gucchi.  We tried the Gucchi Pulao and malai curry. Gucchi Pulao was served with Cranberry Raita.The meal couldnt have been better. Such amazing dishes.  For dessert, we tried Aam Ras ki Rabri. Trust Punjab Grill for playing with flavors and offering you such beauties on the table. Its basically a combination of rabri and aam ras arranged beautifully in layers. Presented beautifully, a delight for Mango lovers.  Punjab Grill has the tradition of serving Paan shots at the end of the meal which are yummy too.  Overall a brilliant experience and special thanks to Mr. Biswajit for the amazing service, great suggestions and beautifully executing our experience."

1.0,"Ordered paneer tikka and brocolli starter which were good. Vegetarian Main course including Paneer Lababdar and Dal Punjabi Grill had no taste whatsoever. Was extremely surprising to see this for a place positioned as premium Punjabi restaurant and also the fact that how can this place be rated so highly at 4.9 . Not properly guided on the veg mains portion size and huge breads that they serve even after asking about the same which ended up with wasting more than half the dal and a lots of breads. Coming to the communication which was made by the restaurant over the call 2 times and not honouring the same. Called them up to check if they can offer 50% off the food bill as Dineout GIRF slots were over and I was told that I can just walk in and avail that offer even though I could not avail it through the app. At the time of billing they just denied it and said we need that booking code from Dineout to give you that offer. Happened because of lack of clarity with the person who picks up the call for reservations, however making a commitment openly twice which they cannot honour is not at all acceptable. Then at the end, the tone with which the manager speaks with you and blatantly gives the bill at the actual amount (without any discount) shows their culture of working and how much they value their customers. Had to take this effort to write my first review because of the extremely unpleasant experience"
5.0,The food was excellent. It was authentic punjabi cuisine. The tandoori jheenga is a must try. A big thanks to Umesh and Justin for giving me a wonderful experience.

4.0,The restaurant is located in Orion mall next to pvr cinemas. Ambience is quite to taste and has an uptown feel to it. Food tastes delicious.

3.0,Great dahi kebabs and a decent buffet spread. High on cost for similar spread in other 4+ star rated places.

5.0,"I am giving this place 5* because it rightly deserves them. While it's an expensive restaurant, their lunch buffet at around 1200 all inclusive is quite a steal. There were 8 varieties of starters, and unique ones at that. One thing that I absolutely loved was a paneer tikka variety which was pink in colour. There were around 6-8 varieties of chaats and salads, soups, and a variety of pickles and accompaniments. Their main course was yet another 6-8 gravies, 2 types of rice, and assorted rotis. Plus there were some 5 varieties of desserts. Basically all the usual, and unusual, Punjabi dishes were served. We visited an Indian restaurant after long, and were very impressed. Absolutely recommend the place if you want to go and eat real good food. The ambience is comforting too, gives the feel of one of those old time fine dine restaurants."

When ever I want to please my wifey I take her here and it the only place where she has a full meal including starters and main course.  The staff is immensely humble and on their toes to serve you. May be the only thing that is always a little pricking is their prices they are sky rocketing.  I would visit this place anytime I want to have authentic punjabi food, and be pampered with some good service.  Not to forget to mention sabuj and bhuwan these guys are as sweet as the Bengali ras gullas are."

Punjab Grill is a let down on all three factors - the drinks are overpriced, food not up to the mark and service terrible. The waiters do not have time to talk, arrogantly deny Zomato Gold services, try to strike deals against Gold service and place food bowls directly on plates. I would definitely rethink before going again."

The quantity they serve is so much that we couldn't go past the starters. However their Dahi ke Kabab are my all time favorites. The Grilled Chicken is also something i would totally recommend. Succulent juicy chicken served with a hint of smoky flavor which bring that tandoori flavor to your palate. Loved the food.  Also, the mocktails and desserts were too good. Tried the pista lassi and firni and rasmalai. Everything was delicious to the core. The rasmalai just melted in your mouth and how good was the firni. Amazing food and equally amazing service.  Thanks once again Mr. Neeraj. Look forward to dine again at this outlet."

Our captain Niraj particularly was very polite and caring. It was a very nice experience. You guys shud visit it.

5.0,"Food: Mouthwatering Ambience: nice and comfortable Staff: most courteous bunch of people I have seen   Today we visited for lunch and tried their buffet. The choices were good and flavors were one of the best we have tried in Bangalore. Being from Punjab, we felt like we were back there  You could surely teach a thing or two to people who think that Punjabi food cannot be made without Oil or excessive Masalas.   What makes the visit more worthy is the courteous and friendly staff. They really help with your choices of drinks, food and breads. They make you really comfortable so you can enjoy your meal.   I would surely come back for more and like to try the rest of menu next time.   Please retain your USPs of flavors and staff and you have found a regular customer in me to your restaurant."

1.0,"After reading some very fine reviews about the place, I decided to pay Punjab Grill a visit along with my family even though it is quite a travel from my place. Paneer Tikka that we ordered was really nice with the good smoky flavor of tandoor, the qty was good enough for 3-4 people. Basis this, we had high hopes from the main course. However, pretty disappointed with dal makhni, the taste was far from authentic. The gravy of malai kofta must have been thicker than it was. Didnt like it at all. It wasnt worth a visit, hope it was a bad day for the chef & not the general standard that they maintain. The desserts were quite a value for money as well as delicious - we ordered litchi ki tehri & kulfi falooda and both were quite good"
5.0,Fantastic food and service ! Very good spread on the buffet and quality was exceptional. We were really impressed by the service of Justin nd i really like this guy amazing .

Please note since this is a fine dining restaurant the a la carte is lil on expensive side.

This was something that the mantri mall was desperately missing for a long time, a fine dining experience The buffet spread was delectable and scrupmtious. Both the veg and non-veg starters were yummy, the live grill and ths starters reminds you of the BBQ Nation. The service was good. Overall an enjoyable experience. However, a small request to the management, please try to innovate with your menu to keep your guest attached to the place. I have been there thrice since its inception, the menu seems to lack the surprise element, especially in starters. Thank you."

5.0,"The name itself speaks out loud for itself, Punjab Grill defines class for you in terms of service, food, ambience and everything good you can think about. This particular outlet, located inside Orion Mall covers a huge premium space in the Mall and has loads of seating space with separate space for families and private groups. The walls are adorned with some war hero pictures and beautiful serveware turned into decorative pieces. We went in a small group with some huge hunger so the items we ordered are below:  Drinks: Imli Ka Boota Meetha Patta Mojito Mango Love Caprioska Jalandhar Express Punjabi Krantt Rola Cola Well, before you get lost among the dishes, let me tell you, each item on the menu is pretty expensive but when you go through the pictures and check the quantity, you would not be dissapointed at all. Among the drinks, if you like to drink strong.. go for Jalandhar Express or Caprioska but if you're a non-drinker, Rola Cola or Mango Love are just for you..!!  Starters: Veg Kebab Platter Soya Chaamp Masala Amritsari Fish Murgh ki Chaampein Bhatti Murgh Tandoori Pomfret Pick any of the above starters and you're tastebuds would be delighted, marination of each dish - spot on, spices on the correct level and each dish cooked to perfection.  Main Course: Amritsari Aloo Kulcha Veg Biryani Kumbh Malai Tak A Tak Meat Punjab Grill Yellow Dal One of the must try items would be the Meat Punjab Grill, Succulently cooked mutton that would take you to next level altogether, pair with some Amritsari Kulchas and it will make your day.  Dessert: Gulab Kheer Rasmalai Choco Gulab Jamun Phirni The desserts are quite economically priced when compared to regular menu, but can be worked on a little in matter of taste.  Overall, Punjab grill offers you an authentic Punjabi Pallette which would definitely connect to your heart and make you feel awesome after trying their food...!!!"

5.0,"Punjab Grill is one of the best fine dine places which serves top notch north Indian food.Located in Orion Mall ,we visited this place after a movie and I must say one of the best decisions to try this restaurant. The ambience is perfect for fine dine,it's good for a qucik family dinner or dining with friends. The place is done keeping in mind the punjab grill ambience which depicts the north Indian essence with photos of the Kings and famous personalities . A private section is also there which is apt for family gatherings.The chandeliers add to the royal feeling plus the golden n wooden colors give it a royal.touch. We ordered the following dishes:  Drinks:  Meetha Patta Mojito:(4/5) Not a pan fan,but the overall twist to the monitor with flavours of paan and gulkand went well with the meal.  Rola Cola:(4.5/5) The masala cola was very good and a saviour during the meal.Glad to order it  Starters:  Amritsari Fish:(5/5) A must order dish if you love me seafood,it comes in huge portions which is sufficient for 3 ppl.The fish was perfectly marinated in spiced and fried.Loved it  Murgh ki Chaampein:(5/5) The chicken leg pieces was well marinated and tasted very good.  Bhatti Murgh:(5/5) If you love chicken you gotta try this.It was very good Tandoori Pomfret  Main Course:  Veg Biryani :(4.5/5) Biryani had awesome.flavours and tasted good.

Do visit this when in Orion Mall to have a awesome dining experience                                             thegalwhoblogs.wordpress.com"

5.0,"A fine dine restaurant located in Orion Mall, Rajajinagar. This place is ideal for all the people looking for the authentic north Indian cuisine. It has a very vibrant Ambiance, courteous staff and good options from the menu to choose from. It has a seating capacity of around 75 people and serves alcohol as well with their in house signature cocktails which is a must try here. It is on the expensive side as its a fine dine restaurant and will cost around 1000 per person.   I visited this place for dinner and had a 5 course meal consisting shorba, starters, mocktails, cocktails, main course and deserts.  As a vegetarian, please note the options are limited compared to the non vegetarians. However, the dishes that were served in veg were outstanding!  In Shorba, I tried the tamatar and mirch ki shorba which was the only one available in veg and tasted delicious with the right quantity for 1  person consisting of right amount of Indian spices and bread crumbs. The mirchi flavor was a plus and it's a must try here!  In starters - Veg kebab platter consisting of paneer tikka, tandoori malai broccoli, veg sheek kebab and veg malai kabab. All kebabs in various shapes and sizes, each one of them were delicious.  - Tandoori Soya chaap, a long char grilled Soya chop with mint chutney is a must try here. Very delicious and tasty.  Cocktails  - Punjabi krantt     Vodka infused with orange juice, jalapenos, lime, orange chunks and chaat Masala. This was presented in bulb and tasted good! Not a strong cocktail though.  - Jalandhar express     long island ice tea with cola instead of beer was a strong cocktail and the presentation was top class!  - Imli ka boota   Whiskey, Jaggery, tamarind and cumin based cocktail which gives an authentic Indian taste as it contains Indian spices. A must try!   Main course  Amritsari Aloo Kulcha  A huge Kulcha with aloo stuffings right out from tandoor was tasting delicious with the gravies.  Mushroom ka gravy  A spicy affair with lots of mushroom pieces infused with Indian Masalas which was cooked well and complemented well with the aloo Kulcha.  Dal Pancharatni  A true Punjabi dish made from 2 exotic and flavored lentils was one of the best dals I've had in recent times. It's a must try as well.  Deserts   Phirni  Rasmalai  Chocolate Jamoon Gulab kheer   All these deserts were presented well and the quantity was perfect too! Not to sweet nor not to heavy, these indulgent deserts made the meal even special after all the spicy affair.  Overall a great experience here at Punjab grill. Their ratings speak a lot about the place and if you are planning to visit an authentic Punjabi restaurant, this is the one then. The restaurant also had zomato gold which makes it a better deal.   Ambiance - 5/5 Quality - 4.5/5 Quantity - 5/5 Taste - 5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Price - 4.5/5"

5.0,"Seldom do we come across a place which excels in every aspect. Be it their food, ambience or service, Punjab Grill deserves a perfect 5 in every department. I usually avoid eating at restaurants located in malls but this one actually changed my perception. Such an amazing dining experience I tell you !  AMBIENCE  If I have to describe the place in one word it has to be ROYAL. The decor is beautifully done in hues of cream, brown & gold which gets an amazing contrast from the vibrant railroad patterned tiles on the floor. The walls adorn specially curated black and white photographs of notable Indian figures. In addition, the high ceilings with crystal chandeliers and the luxurious fabric of the upholsteries make the decor extremely classy and bold.  FOOD  As the name suggests, the place specialises in North Indian cuisine. The menu is very exhaustive having an equally good number of options in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I pretty much concentrated on the non vegetarian section. We started off with the SEEKH KEBAB PLATTER with a couple of mocktails and cocktails for company. Must say, the mocktails were equally fancy. Would recommend the MEETHA PATTA (Beetle nut based) & NIMBOO ACHAROSKA ( mojito + lemon pickle) for the teetotalers. I tried the PUNJABI KRANTT which had a unique combination of vodka with orange juice, jalapeno and chaat masala. And yeah, it was actually served in a bulb, quite electrifying indeed. The Seekh platter had an assortment of chicken, mutton and broccoli. Other appetisers included the SOYA CHAAMP, SALMON TIKKA, TANDOORI JHEENGA, RAUNAQEEN MUTTON SEEKHAN & MURGH TIKKA PUNJABI GRILL. Every item was unbeatable. I haven't had such great quality Soya Chaanp in Bangalore atleast. The Murgh Tikka with an exotic combination of cream and cheddar cheese had a melt in the mouth feel. The Mutton Seekh was again extremely juicy and succulent. The jumbo prawns had a nice cirtusy aftertaste. My fellow diners found the Salmon a bit dry but I absolutely loved it, one of the rare occasions where I had it grilled instead of raw (read- sushi). Nice balance of fennel and honey in there.  For the mains we tried the DAL PANJRATANI, MEAT PUNJABI GRILL, KADHAI MURGH along with TARKARI KESARI BIRIYANI. Dal is a major highlight of any desi meal and the one here was bang on. PANJRATANI implies to the use of five types of lentils; Moong ,Chana, Toor, Urad & Moath. The lamb had an exceptional flavour. The gravy had a real good texture due to the slow cooking technique. I am strictly against the concept of Veg Biriyani but must say the one here was quite appetising. Also, special mention for the GUCHCHI PULAO which I tried for the first time. Gucchi (Morel) is an exotic class of mushrooms which grow only in the Himalayan region. The staff enlightened me that these are sourced all the way from Jammu & Kashmir. The taste is very unique, a bit spongy if I may add.  We barely had any place left for the desserts but I dint wanna miss out on their house special GULAAB JAMUN. They are unique because unlike regular jamuns these have a filling of white chocolate and Nutella inside. Phenomenal taste, you wouldn't know unless you have them. I also absolutely loved their AAMRAS. However, the Lychee ki tehri and Ragi version of qubani ka meetha somehow dint work for me. We sealed the deal with chilled paan shots.  SERVICE Prompt service even on a full house. The staff is extremely cordial and well behaved with good knowledge of the menu. Special mention to Mr.Hari Prasad who was attending our table.  VFM Pricing is quite high as per Indian cuisine. Being a reviewer's table I dint pay for the meal. Otherwise, a meal for two for a la carte would cost 2.5k+ They also have buffets for lunch and happy hours in the evening.  VERDICT Punjab Grill is a luxury dining experience. The food is exceptionally good along with killer ambience. Don't miss their grills and kebabs.  Bon Appetit !"
5.0,"So last night was another of my invites to punjab grill! Branch at orion mall Well it was late evening where the traffic and the hunger is at its peak! So we enter punjab grill and the vibe there was no less than a five star restraunt! The lights the atmostphere everything was just too perfect and was like a dream inside!

Salmon Tikka, ( 4.5/5) (a little dry but cant blame it as we took time to consume it)  Tandoori Jheengha, (4.5/5)  Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill,(5/5)  seekh kebab platter, (5/5) (recommended kebab platter)  raunaqeen seekhan, (5/5)  Mutton seekh kebab(5/5) ( best mutton seekh kebab ever)  meat Punjab Grill, (5/5) (best dish in the house)  kadhai murgh , (5/5) (rich in taste and quite Heavy tastes really yummmmmmyy)  Now the ending deserts yeahhhh!!!  lychee ki Tehri, (4.5/5) (lychee blend quite well with the rabadi) gulab jamun, (5/5) (best gulab jamun ever) aamras rabadi (4.5/5) (weird yet sweet!) ragi de kubani de meetha (5/5) (tasted yummilitious) And to end it all the PAAN SHOT (5/5) (A taste of paan in a shot was the best breathe freshning experience ever)  Lets see the FLAWS are the washroom is in the food court and not in the restraunt (WELL CANT BLAME THE INFRASTRUCTURE)  Honestly this restraunt suprised me as soon as we entered, the vibe, the hospitality the food everything felt like a 5 star cuisine and its worth every penny spent! The food was cooked well and was served fast!"

5.0,"Roaming around at Orion mall, decided to go to Punjab Grill for dinner with friends. And am so glad we did. The ambience is ok but the food definitely makes up for it. The murgh chaamp for starters was yummy with the chicken well marinated. We ordered the chicken dum biryani along with dal makhni and the dum biryani was very good. The dal makhni was just about good and felt that something was amiss. Nevertheless, nothing to complain about and overall, a lovely dinner. The best was yet to come - desserts!!! We ordered the choco Gilab jamun, kulfi falooda, rasmalai and another dessert made with aamras. The deserts were incredibly good! Especially the rasmalai that was really soft and filled with flavour.  The service was impeccable. Special mention to Bhuwan, Prasad and his team for a lovely experience topped with excellent food!  Will be back soon! :)"

4.0,The experience was good. Mr.Viswajith was a wonderful person who attended our table. He was very polite. And the food was good. But they need to include more varieties. Very less varieties at present. Otherwise it's a good place for a lunch buffet.
5.0,"Heard a lot of good words about Punjab Grill. So we decided to give it a go. Ambience was pretty good and the staffs were very cordial and attentive. In the appetizers section tawa macchi (pan fried sole fish) was nice.  Making unique spicy Indian style cocktails is the speciality of Punjab Grill and it didn't disappoint. We had Zomato gold so went for 2+2 on drinks. Both Imli ka Boota and Punjabi Krantt was really nice but bloody Mary cocktail was heavenly and so was Nimboo ka acchar caipirioska. Must try if you are a cocktail lover.  For the main course we had dum ki Biriyani (mutton) and murg lababdar. Both were very good.  Last but not the least, compliemntary pan shots were very refreshing.  Overall very nice experience. Food and beverage and service were excellent. Only downside is the price."
5.0,A really nice place to go to if youd like to have really yum North Indian food. We had an assortment of paranthas and naans along with a non veg grill platter and a paneer lababdar.

5.0,"So it has been a long time for me in Bangalore and I have been missing the authentic North Indian Flavours in my food.  Recently, I got a chance to visit and review Punjab Grill inside Orion Mall at Malleshwaram in Bangalore and I was totally impressed by the food, ambience and the service. Let's now talk about everything in detail.  Punjab Grill is right now featured in 'Bengaluru's Finest' on Zomato and serves North Indian, Mughlai cuisines in Gourmet Fine Dining type ambience.  Location: Punjab Grill is located on 3rd Floor in Orion Mall just beside the food court. The restaurant has its exclusive sitting and kitchen which is not a part of the food court.  Ambience: The lighting is very vivid and walls are decorated with old maharajas of Sikh kingdoms. The music is light and their playlist has a collection of Traditional folk and modern Punjabi songs.  Food and Beverage: The bar menu features almost all type of liquor from soft to hard, they have some signature speciality cocktails which are described with images on the left side of the page, I tried the 'Nimbu ka Aachar Caipiroska' and it was one of a kind, the tangy flavour of the lemon pickle felt great in the Caipiroska. I will recommend you to try some cocktail from their speciality menu.  Coming to food, the menu features North Indian and Mughlai Appetizers, Grills (Veg and Non-veg), Curries (Veg and Non-Veg), Rice, Bread, Accompaniments and Desserts. The description of every food item is given in their menu, I'm going to rate my experience with every dish by rating it on a scale of 5.  GRILLS: * Chicken Tikka Punjab Grill (5/5) * Mutton Ghee Roast (4/5) * Tandori Jinga (5/5) * Salmon Tikka (5/5) [Recommended]  CURRIES: * Kadai Murgh (5/5) * Dal Punjab Grill (5/5) * Prawn Makhan Wala (5/5) [Recommended] * Patiyala Shahi Machi (5/5)  BREADS: * Garlic Naan: (5/5)  RICE: * Tarkari Keseari Biryani: (5/5)  DESSERTS : * Aam Ras Rabdi (5/5) [Recommended] * Chocolate Gulab Jamun (4/5) * Ras Malai (5/5) * Lichi Malai (5/5) * Pan Shots (5/5) [Recommended]  Staff and Service: Service is fast and the staff is very friendly, polite and helpful.  Value for Money: As the restaurant markets itself Gourmet Fine Dining Resturant, prices are little higher but the experience is totally worth it. You should visit at least once if you want to experience their Gourmet Fine Dining for North Indian food.  OVERALL RATINGS:  Location: 5/5 Ambience:4.5/5 Food and Beverage: 5/5 Staff and Service: 5/5 Value for Money: 4/5  thedelighttable.wordpress.com"

5.0,"No better place than Punjab Grill to taste the royal flavors of North Indian cuisine. They specialize for North Western flavors & It is more like a fine dining experience rather than just food alone. Truly MasterClass !!  Located in Orion Mall, many factors including the service, decor, ambiance, light music added to the wonderful dining experience  We couple of friends tried for dinner based on the recommendations & it was bursting of flavors with every dish we ordered.  Thanks to the staff for the suggestions, it was a perfect dinner for each of us leaving with happy smile.  Starters :  Tandoori Jheenga - Jumbo prawns marinated well was grilled to perfection. Great to see such big sized fresh prawns were used. Salmon Tikka - huge pieces of Norwegian salmon marinated nicely with whole spices giving it exclusive taste. Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill - Doesn't taste like the regular chicken grill, it has got much enhanced flavour... meat is very well cooked. Mutton Ghee Roast - Don't miss this if you are spice lover.. Topped with cashew, it is spicy yet tasty which is served with bread to balance the heat.  Main Course :  Prawn Makhan wala - Haven't tasted much better curry of prawns which I remember in these days after i tasted this. This curry taste will be with me for a long time. Special Thanks to Chef this will be my personal favorite.  Patiala Shahi Macchi - Tangy fish curry with good amount of boneless fish pieces is a good option to with our roti.  Kadai Murgh - Thick gravy chicken curry cooked well was super yumm with the bread.. Like the fact of seeing coriander seeds topped on the curry.  Meat Punjab Grill - Lamb shanks which are slow cooked making the meat tender n juicy went well with the bread.  Dal Makhni - Never go wrong with Dal Makhni - The hearty earthy flavors makes you remember eating in hometown  Tarkari Kesari Biryani - After having much of Nonveg curries, we tried Veg version of Biryani.. Veg biryani never tasted soo good for me... the vegetables are well cooked with abundant of them topped ith saffron giving you the niche flavor. I like the way it is presented.  Desserts :  Aam Ras ki Rabri Aur Churi - Woww.... it was thick delicacy with lot to offer.  Choco Gulab Jamun - You hit the right spot when you taste jamun & chocolate in one scoop :) yummyyy  Litchi Ki Tehri - Fresh Fruit infused desserts are always delicious :)  Rasmalai - Classic good Indian sweet to end the dinner :)  Drinks :  Nimboo Acharoska : Just go for it, & Thank me later :) Never thought of having a mocktail with lemon pickle.. it was WOWW  Litchi Mint Smoothie : It was classy... Litchi lovers would love this variant :)  Shikanjvi : Traditional classic lemonade making u remember your childhood days in north :)  Nimboo Ka Achaar Caprioska : Must order cocktail... Go for it, Period.  LIIT : Classic again , you will love it :)  The overall experience made it us a feel special dinner rather than just food alone.."
5.0,"Punjab Grill, an authentic Punjabi cuisine restaurant serving some of the best north Indian dishes, located on 3rd floor, Orion Mall, Malleshwaram.  Visited this place for dinner with a group of friends, the place has amazing ambiance, lightning and decor, light music in the background to make your dining experience better.  The staff were very friendly and co-operative, Thank you Mr. Niraj for coordinating with us throughout the meal.  Ordered various dishes and loved each and every single dish that was served. The spices, the flavors were just delightful.  For Starters we ordered:  Salmon Tikka, Tandoori Jinga, Chicken Tikka Punjab Grill, Mutton Ghee Roast.  Mutton Ghee Roast, my favorite, rich in spice and heat, served with naan to balance the spice. Tandoori Jinga and Salmon tikka, a must try.  For Main course:  Kadai Murgh, Prawn Makhan Wala, Meat Punjab Grill, Patiyala Shahi Machi, Dal Punjab Grill, Ginger Naan and Tarkari Kesari Biryani.  Prawn Makhan Wala is just out of this world, a must try.  Finally for desserts:  Lichi Malai, Chocolate Gulab Jamun, Aam Ras Rabdi and Ras Malai.  I love chocolate, hence chocolate infused gulab jamun was my favorite, Aam ras rabdi is what I highly recommend.  Finally Paan shot to conclude the meal.  This is a definite goto place if you are looking for authentic Punjabi food."
5.0,"Punjab Grill is the first International brand which comes to my mind when I think about north west frontier cuisines. This restaurant came into existence with the sole motive to provide real punjabi (undivided province) food without losing its authenticity. This restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of Orion mall and is pretty easy to locate. I fell in love with the ambience as soon as I walked in. Walls were decorated with old maharajas of Sikh kingdoms and they had lovely lightings. Traditional folk and modern punjabi songs are played in the background which goes well with the service and food. After speaking to the manager and serving staffs, I understood that each and every dish is prepared in traditional way and without compromising on quality. Please have a look at the must have food & Drinks below :  STARTERS :  * Chicken Tikka Punjab Grill       (5/5) *  Mutton Ghee Roast                 (5/5) * Tandori Jinga                            (5/5) * Salmon Tikka                            (5/5)  DRINKS :  * Nimbu ka Achar Capriosca       (5/5) * Shikanji                                     (4/5) * Lichi Mint Smoothie                  (5/5) * LIIT                                            (5/5)  MAINS :  * Kadai Murgh                             (5/5) * Meat Punjab Grill                      (5/5) * Prawn Makhan Wala                 (5/5) * Patiyala Shahi Machi                 (5/5)  DESSERTS :  * Aam Ras Rabdi                          (5/5) * Chocolate Gulab Jamun             (4/5) * Ras Malai                                    (5/5) * Lichi Malai                                   (5/5) * Pan Shots                                    (5/5)  This is not a regular restaurant, come here to experience the real flavours of Punjab."

4.0,Loved this place... Interiors are nice and inviting... Got a great outdoor seating as well facing the road.  The food is so rich that I was nearly stuffed up after the appetizers.. Do not miss out on the lamb chops and the fish tandoori...  The main course was equally good... Can't remember the names but the bread options with mutton and chicken gravies were really filling to the stomach and very satisfying to the taste buds.  A bit heavy on the pocket... We were a group of 3 adults and 2 kids and the bill worked out to around 5k... So if u are in the mood to splurge then this is the place to go.
5.0,"Got an awesome service from Shankar, Sabuj. Give them a raise. Good resources to grow your place. Overall a very nice experience . Over priced but thats fine"

Food was good, we ordered many dishes: bhatti da murg,  dahi ke kabab and chicken butter masala and  dal panjratnani were awesome.  Salmon tikka was not that good and we also found bones in that , so they didnt charge us for that.   Desert and sweets were average.  Ambience was average.   Staff were very polite and service was good.  Dishes were overly priced. Overall 3.5 star"

4.0,"A place for casual dining.  Pro: Nice ambience, good food, amazing service (Thank you to Sabuj who was awesome in service. Good to have you at restaurant, you made it a treat for us).  Cons: Congested, slightly loud - what you typical expect at a punjabi restaurant :)"
1.0,"The food was tasteless and bland. Big disappointment. I went with high expectations and was so wrong. Ordered 3 dishes paneer labdhar, dal makhani and spinach and corn. I dunoo how this has a 4.9 rating."
3.0,"Went for dinner - for the price, the place needs to be a lot better. What's good: polite and very helpful staff. What's not: 1. Chairs were stained pretty bad, need to be reupholstered. They should also have cushions for kids who are too big for the baby chair but not tall enough to reach the table. 2. Seating is a little odd - if you are seated against the wall, one person will be on a chair and the other on the sofa. 3. Staff are well meaning and polite, but need to be trained a lot better - they were struggling to put things on the table and knocked things down in the process. We ordered two drinks, but they didn't come together - not a big deal, but given their prices, I would expect more finesse. 4. Food portions are good but it would have helped if the staff had told us more - their rotis are huge and we ended up wasting a lot. 5. Drinks were very inconsistent. The first cocktail my wife hardly had alcohol in it (we were ok with that) but the repeat drink was loaded.  Overall, good location with a lot of potential, but they need to up their game a lot to match their prices."
5.0,"Really good food and amazing service sabuj and justin. Would want to come here again and again. Authentic Punjabi food, perfect ambience. Thank you"
5.0,Exceptional service and food. Would like to compliment Justine and Sabuj who went out of their way to make sure that our experience was nothing short of amazing.

5.0,"Excellent food and excellent service by Mr.Sabuj, made it the most pleasureable of experiences. Will definitely be coming back for more. Must try: Chicken Tikka Butter Chicken Tandoori Roti And the Apple Cinnamon Ice Tea."
5.0,"Amazing test and freshly made. Chicken Tandoor Leg was marinated nicely. Further dal makhani at par with ITC. I would recommend chicken starter, dahi balls, biryani , dal makhani and well varieties of deserts"
5.0,"Okay, let's break this down. I'm one of those people who 'Zomato-es' a place before going there. And with this place also, I did the same. End result: satisfied. So I decided to check it out on a Sunday night with my cousins. This place is located on the same floor as the PVR at Orion Mall and the moment you enter itself, a fresh fragrance grabs your attention. The image of a colourful bar right opposite the entrance, and the brown+yellow-ish ambience of the place just blends in perfectly with those fresh jasmine flowers at every table. Having seated down comfortably at our table and looking around at the above- than-average number of people, we deduced that this was the perfect place to be for dinner on a Sunday night. Scene 2 Act 1: Dining And this is where the protagonist of our fine dining experience comes into the picture, Mr Niraj. A chirpy fellow, always flashing a huge smile on his face, who is not only humble but is also very knowledgeable about the job that he does. And for this very reason, I will not label him as a waiter, instead, for the sake of this review, I will call him ,'The Man'. The best part about the entire Punjab Grill experience is that, even though they place a fancy menu right in front of you, people like 'The Man' help in choosing for you. And not only that, since these people have been working there for quite some time, they actually know the portions that are served and can even establish how much a person eats just by looking at them. (Not to judge them in any way) We ordered a mango smoothie, to which The Man replied that it would be in our best interest to split it between two people as it was considerably large and we agreed to him; which turned out to be quite true. Another drink that we ordered was the Desi Mary which is basically a desi version of a Bloody Mary. For all you vampires out there, this is the perfect drink for y'all mostly because of the fact that it has a lot of tomato juice, which gives it a blood colour and the mix was absolutely perfect. How he managed to take something like tomato juice and turn it into this wonderful drink, is beyond me. Kudos to the bartender!  Now it was time for the beast to enter: Paneer Tikka Multani. Forget every other paneer dish you have ever had and just close your eyes while you bite into those soft juicy paneer chunks perfectly mixed with herbs and spices. Un-believable! If Bhallaldeva had seen this dish before he ever saw Devasena, there would never even have been a Bahubali 2. The judges at MasterChef would get up off their feet and applaud ferociously because this... this is one of the bestest things you'll ever taste! Mind=blown!  I could keep going on and on about this experience and in case you haven't noticed, I haven't even reached the main course yet. Which itself speaks volumes about the kind of excitement that is revolving around the entire Punjab Grill experience. P.S: whatever you order the portions are very large, so make sure you are on an empty stomach; because once you're done, it is gonna be like the sets of A Game of Thrones battlefield. (Lesson- learnt) Please do check it out and have a peaceful time with your family or your loved ones. Totally worth it! (The mango smoothie in the picture is a 1 by 2 serving. Now you get an idea, don't you?)  Food: 5* Ambience: 5* Service: 5* Air conditioning: too cold Price: 4* (around 1200 per head) Quantity: 5* (totally worth the price) Niraj, aka The Man: 6*"

This place is located on the food court. Ambience is nice beautiful chandelier paintings of kings. Recently they have added bar to this place and have some signature cocktails and believe me they are very good in presentation. We had Jalandar Express which was served in a hukka. Ita basically a LIIT but instead of pepsi they used beer and it tast nice with beer. Second we had was Punjabi Karantt which was vodka based spicy drink served in a bulb shape glass. We liked both the drinks. For starters we had palak patta chat, paneer tikka multan and veg kurkure which was served in shot glass with sweet and spicy chatni. Before goin there we thought as its based on punjabi theme there main dishes will be more non veg but they have equal variety of veg and tasty dishes. For the main we had dal punjab grill which is basically a super tasty dal makhni, paneer lababdar & kumbh makai taka tak. Everyrhing taste really good and have distinct feel to it. They have nice variety of Indian deserts also. We had gulab jamun, ras malai and phirni aand out of these we liked the first two more. Service is very good and the staff is very friendly, polite and helpful. Our server was Biswajeet and he was superb in him job but sadly that day was his last day in Punjab grill hope to meet him in any other restaurant."

The Place was for fully packed and cocktails were nice but I guess they reduce the alcohol quantity for gold memberships, like other restaurants! The main course and dessert didn't had much options! The starters(5 non-veg, 5 veg)were good but not that worthy compared to pure buffet restaurants!"

5.0,"Such a lovely place to have dining with your loved ones, family or friends as they serve veg, non veg food along with drinks with such push ambience n friendly hospitality.  I had been to their Orion mall branch yesterday and had lovely time indeed.  Justin from the staff served us all the delicious menu who already knew my friends who had been there since time back. We had fish curry along with jeera rice and some rotis.  Fish curry was something different we tried with tamarind flavor and had nice punch to it along with fresh jeera rice and light roti.  Then we ordered desserts and they were the highlights for sure. Gulab Jamun, rasmalai and firni.... Sounds mouth watering right!  Those were absolute delight and you must try their desserts so keep some space from your main course.  To our surprise where I was already full of desserts, Justin brought pan kulfi for us as complimentary delicacy and it was such a lovely combination of flavours.... Where I only finished max of it   Lovely ambience, very friendly n attentive hospitality and great flavors makes it an absolute must try.  Place - Punjab Grill Location - 4th floor, Orion mall, near sandal soap factory metro , bengaluru More speciality - yet to discover  Rating (out of 5)  Restaurant - 4.5 Dish featured - 4.5 Flavours - 5 Service - quick & friendly Overall -"
5.0,"Being a regular to the Koramangala outlet of Punjab Grill and absolutely in love with their North Indian fare, I had to rush to this outlet of Punjab Grill in my quest for good North Indian food after the Koramangala outlet decided to close it's doors. It was one fine day when we decided to go check out this place as we were in the vicinity. The place is located in Orion mall and was full even on a weekday!  The place has a royal touch and it allured us even more. As we made ourselves comfortable, we vouched for the starters. In the veg starters, we had the Palak Patta Chaat, Tandoori soya chaamp, Khumb ki Tikki and Dahi ke kebab. These items were brilliant! The Dahi ke Kebab was one of the best I have ever tasted. Talking about the Khumb ki Tikki, it was one delightful mushroom starter which we relished. In the non-veg starters, we tried the Salmon Tikka, Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill, Ghee Roast Mutton and Raan-e-Sikandari. Let me tell you, all these dishes are a must try here. The presentation of these dishes and the taste was brilliant! We also had our share of some cocktails with the food. The Nimbu ka Achar Caipiroska, Jalandhar express, Desi Mary curry patta Maar ke and Bailey's shake were the ones we tried. My favorite was the Nimbu ka Achar Caipiroska and Bailey's shake, you should definitely vouch for these two! And yes, the drinks looked beautiful. The presentation was a sight to the eyes! Moving to the main course, we had Dal Panjratni, Amritsari Malai Kofta and Murgh Makhani with their famous Keema kulcha and how we loved it! I was in awe of the Dal and the Malai Kofta, I relished it and finished everything off my plate!  The sweet tooth, that I am, could not resist stuffing myself with the sweet delights! Let me tell you the hot Gulab jamuns with nutella stuffed within are heavenly! The one with Honey stuffed and the one with bits of almonds and pistachios are also a must try here! The Jalebi Rabdi was the next dessert which we devoured and relished!  The service is quite good, the pricing is a bit on the higher side but it's worth the culinary journey that it takes you to! Punjab Grill never disappoints! Cheers!                                              thefatummy.wordpress.com"
5.0,"After a rather stormy past with the exit of Jiggs Kalra, the founder of Punjab Grill, this restaurant has come a full circle and the popularity of this restaurant speaks for itself. I happened to visit this place on a Wednesday evening expecting a sparse crowd, but lo and behold, this place was three-fourths full, early on a weekday evening. Located in Orion Mall, this place is not very large, but it should expand, given the massive interest this place has managed to create.  This place has a host of innovative dishes and rinks, apart from the traditional Punjabi dishes, and while its basics are in place, some of these new creations do pack a punch.  Cocktails:  Nimbu ka Achar Caipiroska: A classic vodka cocktail, but with a twist. Vodka, Lime, Sugar and yes, Lemon Pickle! It turned out to be a truly delightful cocktail, and I loved the intensity of this drink. It was beautifully balanced, and yet packed a punch.  Jalandhar Express: This is an interesting take on the Long Island Iced-Tea, and along with the traditional spirits, the cola base is replaced by beer, and it is actually served in a hookah container. Quirky, but not quite as balanced.  Food: Here are some of the items I thoroughly enjoyed:  Dahi ke Kebab: I have always been a fan of this dish, and if made perfectly, this dish is a winner all the way. And perfect it was, here at Punjab Grill. A crisp outer layer, and as you cut through, the dahi-based stuffing comes oozing out. Highly recommended!  Palak Patta Chaat: Being a Lucknowite, a chaat needs to be really good to wow me. This one was a surprise, with the flavours being spot on. Crisply fried spinach leaves stacked in a tower on the base of a lovely sweetened yogurt, tamarind and mint chutney and a few other odds and ends. Beautiful!  Raan-e-Sikandri: A good raan takes a lot of time to prepare, and is very easy to get wrong. The dish served here was ridiculously good! Beautifully presented, a leg of lamb cooked to perfection in a tandoor, the smokiness was apparent here and the meat was succulent!  Khaam Khatai(Mutton Galauti): This dish wasnt quite the galauti that we are used to, and had a tinge of mustard in it, which I didnt really like. This dish is named after the famous Naan Khatai, a butter cookie famous in the North, but I failed to see the resemblance here.  Murgh Makhini: Yes, one of the highly anticipated dishes, the Murgh Makahni was beautifully done, with no major deviation from the traditional recipes. Some dishes are not meant to be tweaked, and  I loved the fact the this one was so true-to-its roots. Well Done! We relished this dish with some Keema Kulchas (which were more like stuffed paranthas and has a generous filling of mutton mince, but we didnt mind, as they were so good)  Dal Makhani: Yup, this one was spot on as well and I couldnt have asked for a better version of this dish, which so many restaurants get terribly wrong. This was perfectly done, and not too oily as well. It went well with the jeera rice that we ordered.  Desserts: We had the chocolate gulab jamun, which was exquisite. The rabri and jalebi were decent too. I liked the litchi ki tehri, but I would have preferred it to be tad less sweet.  Verdict: Punjab Grill is surely not down and out, and the superb and highly authentic food, warm service, excellent presentation and the razzmatazz of a few flashy drinks is sure to attract the attention of folks who love Punjabi food. The pricing is a tad bit high, but considering the quality of food served here, it shouldnt matter too much. Highly recommended!                                             theuncliched.com"
4.0,The taste of the food is nice and the serving is nice I like the place and little you have to upgrade the food the variety are less and I like it
5.0,"Excellent food and service. We had the kebab platter, murgh shorba, butter chicken with naans. All the items were perfect. Had the perfect meal. Mr Anuj attended to us very well. :)"
5.0,"Punjab Grill has always been on top of my wish list restaurants and finally I got to visit in a rainy evening.    The weather called for some soup & the Subz Shahi Shorba looked very inviting.  I settled for that even before we all got to order our drinks.  A delicious vegetable broth cooked with spinach pure with roasted garlic & cumin.  The highlight was the sauted corn that added to the crunch of this creamy soup.  The flavours were right, well balanced, but the soup could have been a little more creamy.  Punjab Grill has a wide variety of drinks, but we decided to try their Signature Variants.  The best part of their entire drinks menu is that, almost all of them has a mocktail / non-alcoholic version.  I opted for the Desi Mary Curry Patta Marke, was served in a weird lab apparatus, little difficult to drink though, but was fun.  This drink essentially is a Bloody Mary spiked with curry leaves & some chaat masala, decent.  Having recently exposed to the Palak Patta Chaat, I wanted to try this Chandini Chowk specialty here.  While i was ordering that, my friends suggested me a few other vegetarian options that Punjab Grill is famous for.  The Dahi Kebab & Tandoori Soya Chaap.  With a promise to share these large portions we quickly ordered them & the dishes arrived swiftly.  Must mention the service here, it was quick, friendly & kind of non-intrusive.  The Palak Patta chaat was delicious, was presented beautifully & had retained the nice crisp with all the garnishing of the chaat, well balanced & well seasoned dish.  I have had dahi Kebabs elsewhere, across Bangalore, & Delhi. I was pleasantly surprised with the version is Dahi Kebab served here.  It was super smooth, delicious, perfectly seasoned, right balance of flavours & textures.  It was not one of the best, it was the best I have had so far.  Am definitely visiting them soon just to taste this wonderful dish.  The Tandoori Soya Chaap was a great dish as well, the Soya had the consistency of a non-vegetarian Dish, but the flavour was really good.  It was well marinated & Wonderfully chargrilled.  The Bharwaab Kumb Peshawari was another bestie here, the beautifully picked Paneer & sauted mushroom stuffing on a large mushroom was super delicious, its a vegetarians delight.  Another dish thats gonna make me come here more often.  For mains, we decided to order a couple of gravies with rice & rotis to share.  The Punjab Grill Special Dal was rich, creamy & wonderfully seasoned.  The mild smoky flavour added to the taste with rice & rotis.  Being a huge rice eater, I personally preferred the dal with the Jeera Pulao, which was cooked to perfection & tasted delicious.  Loved the Kofta Gravy as well, it was a little too sweet to my taste, but thats how its made & its made well here in Punjab Grill.  Too full with the mains, I decided to skip the desserts, while I did overhear some good things about their Jalebis & Chocolate Jamuns.  This place rocks with the Dahi Ke Kebab & The Bharwaan Kumbh Peshawari, you can end up here just to have this, even the non-vegetarians would love it for the sheer complexity & the flavour profiles these two dish pack, thats quiet a punch I must say.  The drinks were amazing, innovative & packs quiet a heady punch, head here with your herd, this place wouldnt disappoint you."

5.0,"I always love to eat in a good Punjabi restaurant, Punjab Grill fits that bill perfectly. Located in Orion mall one doesn't need to worry about parking vows   The menu offers good choice for both veg and non-veg. I love their innovation and take on some of the dishes.  Start of with some good kesar lassi or some cocktails.  For starters I would recommend - Palak Patta Chaat (spinach leaves soaked in gram flour and fried, tastes amazing) , Paneer Soola (generous size paneer cubes well marinated with yogurt, red chilli and grilled) , Tandoori Soya chaap (I must say this is a winner for me. Its among the Top 3 Soya chaap i have had in Blr) and finally Dahi ke kabab (this made my day..again a clear winner). Overall the starters are just amazing and mouth watering.  Well I always maintain that when in a Punjabi restaurant you gotta have the Dal Makhani. Well I did try it out and must say was quite impressed. Perfectly cooked with the right creamy structure (Highly recommended). Malai Kofta and Panneer sabji is also one can try out. We have variety of breads which one can choose from.  Desserts don't think twice just go for Jalebi with rabri and Chocolate gulab jamun. You will love every bite of it   Food: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambience: 4.5/5 Hygiene: 5/5  Cheers, theeatingpanda                                             instagram.com"

5.0,"You know a Punjabi restaurant is good when you have an authentic butter chicken and a Dal makhani and both of these were bang on. Nice decent ambience with really good service and ofocurse nice food, this place is a must visit be you are a veg or a non veg. Nicely dressed drinks with good alcohol in those makes your evening a treat. The aura of this place takes you in surely ****************************************************  WHAT WE HAD  We were there on a Wednesday evening. The place almost full, got a table in around 10 mins. All set up we were treated with a papad, green chutney and onions. Surely a north indian chef would have crafted this chutney.  In STARTERS we ordered   PALAK PATTA CHAAT - Crispy if you eat it quick and nice fried basin flavoured spinach with mix of chutneys. Surely one of my personal favourites  DAHI KEBABS. - Being a core non veg and still rating this dish the best leaves you an impression. Surely one of the best dishes served  SUBZ SHAHI SHORMA - Not very pleasing for me. Cooked in spinach puree, I personally dint like it much  TANDOORI SOYA CHAP. - Veggies paradise and I can bet they are amongst dormant people who make an authentic one in Bangalore  MURGH TIKKA- Again nicely marinated and prepared to be best in class, this was nice and tender  GHEE ROAST MUTTON - Again roasted to perfection and ample ghee to smell the dish. Was really fresh, chargrilled in tandoor and well marinated  FISH AMRITSARI. - Right to say don't expect decent fish in a Punjabi restaurant. Not the best ones and avoid this to have many other good dishes. Same goes with Jheenga  DAL MAKHANI - Surely the perfect ones. This has been nailed. Very authentic and goes well with any naan or rice. Hats off chef  MURGH MAKHANI - Aka Butter chicken. Again my personal favourite. The gravy is nicely made out of Rich tomatoes and perfected to authentic. Surely a must have dish BAILEY'S SHAKE. - Smoothness of baileys in a crunched Oreo shake, this is a must have drink to try. Nice and simple yet too good to taste make you feel high.  Nicely filled Amritsari kulchas to accompany with the gravies. ****************************************************  OVERALL  AMBIENCE. - 4/5 SERVICE. - 5/5 FOOD. - 4.5/5 PARKING. - 5/5 HYGIENE. - 4/5                                             akhilkohlifoodjourney.wordpress.com"

5.0,"We had a fabulous experience here on my birthday . I was living in Delhi/ Gurgaon earlier so have had a chance to visit Punjab Grill outlets there but the food and service quality here was significantly better. I didnt care for Punjab Grill much earlier but this visit has changed my opinion   . Chef Manish and Sonu who was part of their service team personally ensured our requests to keep the food non spicy were taken care off and prepared a beautiful fresh mix veg curry that was the star dish that day. The kebab  platter and dal makhani was also fantastic . We tried the soya chap gravy and the starter and it was reasonably good .   No complaints there. For drinks I tried the hot toddy and the family tried mattha, and Virgin Mary and it was all great. I was fairly impressed with the virgin hot tody drink as it was quite soothing if you have a cold . In the pic below you have Sonu who served us well that day and ensured our requests were translated well. Thank you. Were coming again."
4.0,"Are you craving for some punjabi food? Are you in seek of a restaurant which serves great punjabi food? Then, put an end for your cravings with punjab grill.  This hidden gem which sits in orion mall dishes out some authentic punjabi dishes for affordable prices. The ambience was luxurious with beautiful portraits and seating was quite comfortable. The staff were super quick and courteous. Try out the below dishes when you visit punjab grill.  Meetha patta: (Mocktail) For me it's truly a bliss. It has got the strong flavour of gulkand, katta, meeta and paan. These ingredients are settled nicely at the bottom and you need to mix and sip. You would definitely love the flavour of pan.  Kesar pistheywali lassi : This is definitely a must try one. The consistency of lassi is thick and ingredients are saffron, Kesar, pista and yogurt. Every sip will urge you to have more .  Palak patta Chat : Spinach leaves are thin coated with basin flour and fried moderately and accompanied by tamarind chutney. It tastes crispy and little tangy.  Salmon tikka : Salmon is perfectly marinated in mustard oil, honey and ginger etc. The pieces are super tender and will just melt in your mouth with pleasing taste.  Murgh makahani : Chicken pieces are finely minced and cooked with tomato gravy, cashew and marinated with blend of spices. Chicken pieces are cooked perfectly and it has that strong masala flavour.  Dessert platter : It comprises of phirni, gulab jamun, rabdi with jalebi. Phirni is moderately sweet and rabdi with jalebi is super delicious. Jalebi is crispy and rabdi is thick and will impress your taste buds with its authentic taste.  Tandoori naan and garlic naan are fluffy and tasty. I would say this is a worth visiting place for punjabi food in the area of malleshwaram. Take your time to indulge in their authentic flavours."

We were served by Mr. Buvan who was friendly and polite in serving us well.

The first starter was 'Paneer ke sholey' .. big sized..mouth watering paneer chunks that just melt in the mouth, with the spicyness customized to our taste buds. The cocktails were great too. Then came the biryani which was less spicy and Prabhat himself offered to again customize and give a more spicy one..loved it. To top it all we ordered a kulfi faluda..in the absence of faluda we were given the kulfi complimentary. This was one of the best restaurant experiences in a long time."

4.0,"4 stars for food, service, ambience & hospitality. Minus 1 star for charging 125 Rs for mineral water & 10% service charge over the bill. We had a veg buffet & loved it. Everything was great. Only the bill was a turn off. They should stop charging service charges & reduce the cost of mineral water. 125Rs for a bottle of water with MRP of 20Rs is ridiculous. It's a great place for food lovers but the value for money proposition will go for a toss bcoz of the above mentioned facts. If u r a food lover, it's a treat. But if u have a penchant for the penny u will feel the pinch."

5.0,"Visited on a Friday evening in orian mall for the second time, was not too crowded got the seats. Ambiences is good(fine dine), and interior is beautiful too with paintings. Staff were very friendly and made us comfortable.  We ordered few drinks and appetizers, Sonus service was good and fast. They have vegetation options also. They provide roasted papads, green chutney(which was good) and onions at the starting which goes well with drinks. Chandni chowk ki papdi chat and Palak Patta chat was what we ordered, both were tasty and very appealing to eat. Palak patta was something different, very crispy and tasty. Last visit I had tired the main course, they have wide variety of breads to choose, panner kadhai and bhindi do pyaza were good and tasty. Prices are bit on the higher side for main course, but worth the taste.  Overall, would recommend if youre looking for some authentic north Indian food and a fine dine restaurant for family or group outings.  Will visit again!"

4.0,Punjab Grill does not need any introduction in F&B industry. It is a trademark of transcendence in luxury dining and legitimate authentic North Indian Cuisine. I decided to drop in with my family one fine evening to give my tastebuds a royal treat. Punjab Grill has an elegant outlet in Orion Malls with a graceful setting. The place is intricately decorated and beautiful interiors startle you.                                                                 ...Read full post on foodndestinations.com
4.0,"Punjab Grill is one of the elite brands in India when it comes to fine dining experience. With a skillfully curated menu covering best of Punjabi and mughlai cuisine, this place tries to touch the best of taste buds that are otherwise deprived here in Bangalore in lack of authentic cuisine.  Ambience It's a regular fine dine place with cushion base and couch based seating. There are separate sections as well for groups and corporate dinings. The striking feature is the variety of chandeliers present. Finally the walls are decorated with frames depicting portraits from Indian vintage.  FOOD and DRINKS  Paneer tikka multani This is my favorite takeaway from my experience here. Infact, is the best paneer tikka I have ever had in my life. The tandoor flavor apt and we'll evident, and soft well marinated chunks of paneer, this starter is a must.  Dahi k kebab Golden fried decently thick round kebabs made with fresh hung curd with slight touch of cardamom and coriander. Usually I don't like cardamom flavored dahi k kebab cz it renders a sweetish touch to the spicy starter trail, but this one was done delicately and furnished a good flavor.  Murgh Malai tikka Again one of the best chicken tikka I ever came across. The chargrilled flavor was rendered beautifully and the pieces were tender. It had a blend of spcies with cheddar cheese and is a must try.  Champ Tajdar Chargrilled lamb chops well marinated in kasoori methi and cardamom masala, it had tenderness and flavor infused deep within. Really big chunks to satisfy two people.  Punjab Grill dal makhani So my taste buds know the authentic daal makhni flavor, and this wasn't it. It was however close to authentic. I loved the creaminess and consistency. The wow factor was not there as a masala was kept towards sober side and not spicy.  Paneer lababdar This was a rich paneer dish loaded with veggies and soft paneer chunks, very homely in flavor.  Murgh Makhni This butter chicken was again more towards sober side and less towards authentic. It was however good and not overly sweet.  Malai kofta So this was a good dish with very little or no sweetness. Usual cashew curries have some sugar but this one was rich and more solo, with little or no sugar, which initially didn't help as no flavor could be observed, but later the palate developed. What I loved was the fact that there was no sugar addition to paneer koftas, a common mistake by many. There was clotted cream and pistachios inside.  Desserts Our favorite desserts weren't available, which was a downside. Request PG to please stock up.  Litchi ki tehri There were litchis and sulatanas in this thickened milk dish, bit oversweet for my palate yet something new and interesting.  Gulab jamun Extremely soft, aptly sweet and very delicious.  SERVICE and COSTING Punjab Grill comes in the band of highly expensive places. Service is top notch, all the staff is well spoken and trained and educated well about the dishes. They ensured we had a good time.                                             instagram.com"

5.0,Food is tasty but less quantity Sabuj was the table responsible person who did the job good. Also the ambience is good. Its a must visit restaurant.
4.0,"This place has a classy feel to it . Located inside the Orion mall at level 3, this is a north Indian fine dine. Derives its influence from Punjabi and Pathani royal cuisine.  Golden drizzling light from chic chandeliers, wooden furniture and classic decor make up this place. On one side the glass walls give a view overlooking the mall.  DRINKS  I tried the good old kesar pista lassi. After all How can you not try lassi in a Punjabi restaurant. Thick, creamy, lots of pista and a bite of pedha in the center.. it was good. Kheera and jeera mojito was excellent. Cucumber flavour came out really well along with other components.  SOUP Tamatar shorba was decent.Subz Shahi shorba tasted average for me.  STARTERS  Dahi ke kebab-  Soft, succulent and subtle flavour. Highly recommend.  Veg. Kurkure-  Wonton skins wrapping up cheesy mushroom and olives and coated with crispy seviyaan. Deep fried. Loved the presentation in shot glasses with honey chilli sauce. Great flavours again.   Paneer tikka multani- Paneer was really soft and tasted good.  MAIN COURSE   Dal makhni- Im a staunch dal makhni lover, and If you ask my verdict Id say little margin to perfection. Malai kofta had a strong  kesar pista flavour but little dry on the inside.  Paneer lababdar - gravy tasted average though paneer was really soft. Overall, main course needed improvement.  DESSERTS  Kheer was a balance of sweetness. If you dont like too sweet .. you can go for this.. I liked it very much.  Litchi ki tehri had rich consistency... thickened milk with shahi litchis and sultanas. This ones for people with sweet tooth!  Gulab jamun- Well, nothing can possibly go wrong with this.  Rasmalai- Umm... disappointed!..... The Ras seemed diluted and lacked flavour.  Gurh ka halwa- The menu does not show the description. This is essentially sooji ka halwa prepared with gur (jaggery). Can try.  Service was excellent. Our servers attended to us with extreme care.Cost wise, found it to be on the higher side."
5.0,Service is very good. Nice presentation and staffs are very helpful and polite. The captain bikash is very nice and helpful. Must visit place food and variety is awesome
4.0,"Punjab Grill was on my list since a long time but because of the distance from my place, I never dared to pay them a visit. Finally it was on a weekday when my foodie gang decided to dine here and I was overjoyed.  Located on the third floor of Orion Mall, this place offers spacious seating arrangements and a fine dining experience to the guests. Royal Sikh paintings and fancy plates being decorated on the walls gives a aristocratic feel for sure.  Our food journey started with varieties of papad and their signature cocktails. There was roasted, fried and masala papad served with green chutney, not to forget the chutney was brilliant. Each of their cocktails come with an amazing fusion. Few of my recommendations would be - Nimbu ka Achaar Caipiroska - An excellent blend of vodka, lemon pickle flavour and brown sugar. The booze was mild but the taste was quite impressive. Punjabi Krantt - Again a Vodka based drink with combination of orange juice, lime, chaat masala and jalapenos. Best for those who like to spice up their drinks. Jalandhar Express - This is the regular LIIT but instead of cola, they have used beer and the flavour of beer is quite strong here. Beer lovers would love this for sure. Bailey's Shake - So this was a combo of Oreo and Bailey's milkshake. I simply loved this drink, it was more like a milkshake than a cocktail.  Punjab Grill has truly a lot to offer in the starters section, some of which took my attention were- Paneer Tikka Multani - Succulent paneer chunks stuffed with cheese were simply delicious and melted in the mouth. Dahi ke Kebab - This had a sweet and slightly tangy taste which I simply loved. The stuffing was filling and quite delectable. Tandoori Jheenga - The tandoori Tiger prawns were quite appetizing and flavoursome. Murgh Malai Tikka - This was my favourite among the starters. The chicken chunks were cooked to perfection and had a really soft texture. Veg Kurkure - Again an excellent preparation from the Chef for the veg eaters. It had mushroom stuffing rolled in seviyaan, a unique item to try. Chaamp Tajdar - These are the lamb chops. The full plate comes with 5 huge pieces and is quite filling. An authentic Punjabi dish. Bhatti Da Murgh - This was a recommendation from our server and we were not disappointed. But I would still go with the malai tikka over this one.  So the main course was a slight disappointing affair. We had Raarhya meat (mutton) and murgh makhani to go with the bread basket. Raarhya meat was good but felt like it lacked flavours. Murgh makhani was truly appetizing and went nicely with the butter naan. Dal Punjab Grill was again not bad but it did not meet our expectations from an authentic Punjabi cuisine, point of view. Then came the malai kofta which was flavoursome but the stuffing felt a bit dry.  From the desserts, we tried almost all of their specialities. The Gulab jamun was the best out of the lot. I even enjoyed the kheer which was not very sweet and had a mild taste. However, the rasmalai was a disappointment and Gurh ka halwa was quite average.  Service was top notch and the staff is extremely polite and organized. They maintained the same level of dedication end to end which truly impressed us.  Overall, it was a great experience for all of us. I can go there any number of times just for the starters."
5.0,"We had a great time here! The food is delicious and the service is good too! Loved the paneer tikka! Sabuj, helped us place the order and made us feel at home by his service ! Thank you, Sabuj!"

5.0,"We went to Punjab Grill on 19/08/2018 and ordered for Desi Mary it was gud and strong and I like the concept of the presentation, but its little difficult to sip from the side. The Raan was spicy as we wanted we were planning to order 2 starters but then the waiter said this one dish will fill you up gud and asked us to tak a call on the other dishes later. Well he was right it was a filling meal. Well cooked with exact amount of spices. Nalli was a little disappointing the gravy was a little more jelly consistency and the meat was not hot it was medium. The kulfi falooda was a lovely desert."

5.0,"A 5 to this place !!!  Went in for their lunch buffet and we went WOW with variety and spread they had to offer...  I find this place worth every penny they charge...  No special mention of any dish, everything was really yummy...  Ambiance and hospitality was at another level, loved it !!!  Note : Mineral water was very expensive (from Bhutan I read on the bottle)"
5.0,"Food - 4/5 Ambience - 5/5 Price - 4/5 Service - 5/5 Experience- 5/5 Hygiene - 4/5 ( No washroom inside restaurant, would need to use mall washroom) Parking - NA ( Inside Orion Mall, mall parking can be utilised ) Fire Safety - The restaurant is situated on mall 4th floor. Kitchen not blocking exit. No apparent blocking element for exit. Single exit with no visible secondary exit. No visible fire safety device.  The very moment you enter this restaurant you would get a grand and classy feeling which is unparalleled. The wall is adorned by giant paintings and pictures of rich Sikh heritage which really feels good to see. the choice of music is very much North Indian or rather typical Punjabi.  I would start to mention that this place is are fine dining restaurant and the prices are also at par with the premium five star restaurant. So for sure this place is going to give a deep pocket pinch.  But however, the ambience, decor and experience along with well behaved and courteous staff kind of makes up to that. The innovation on food items was really very good. Although felt few main courses dishes could have been better. Most of the starter items were good. Drinks were mostly nice. And dessert really amazing. Main course items are what chef might like to look into and improvise a bit.  Liked ""Imli ka Boota"", the desi whiskey sour with tamarind. The flavour was interesting and refreshing.  ""Pineapple Litchi Whiskey sour"" was good and innovative too.  ""Desi Mary Curry Patta marke"" was Virgin Mary served in a chillum and tempered with dry roasted curry leaves. Was interesting, and had nice punch. Most importantly, the innovation was really very great.  ""Coconut Pineapple mojito"" was interesting.  ""Papdi Chaat Mathha"" was just like a Chaat served in a glass. Didn't quite like it as drink.  I loved their starter items.  As fine dine, they probably need to work more on the main course items to justify the fine dine prices.  Desserts were innovative and great."
5.0,"I have visited many Punjabi restaurants in Bangalore but this restaurant has another level of food experience with nice decor. This fine dining restaurant serves mouth watering North Indian cuisine. Every dish they served was with awesome presentation. Their drinks served were very nice and innovative. The food quality is very good no doubt at all. But I liked their starters more than main course items.  Food I liked  Palak patta chaat- deep fried spinach with hint of spice. They serve it in a heavy stone bowl and it was looking really good.  Dahi ke kabab- This kabab was made only with Hung curd mix with coriander leave and minimum spices served with almond on top of it. Very healthy and filling.  Tandoori Jheenga- The grill prawns were very soft and it almost melted in your mouth. It can be your perfect starter.  Murg tikka Punjab grill- This is a typical chicken tikka  tender, juicy meat with perfect masala.  Kumbh ki tikki- It was a mixture of mushroom and potato. But it tasted like aloo tikki. I could not really feel the taste of mushroom.  Paneer tikka multani- Grill and spice it up very nicely. The panner quality was really good.  In the main course :-  Dal punjab grill- This was not quite good. The dal was not rich and the dal was whole.  Mix vegetable- The vegetable were bit raw and was not mix properly .  Their three flavour of gulam jamun  pista, nutella, regular was reall good.  Must try their lichi ki tehri  It is a thick rabdi with lichi. This is a very unique and delicious.  Pineapple and coconut mojito was very refreshing. I liked the coconut flavor in mojito  They need to work more on their main course dishes to justify the fine dine price. Otherwise their service, ambience and entire experience of fine dining was very nice. My intended rating for this place would be 4.5. Thanks to the management for their kind invite. We really enjoyed it."
5.0,"A Punjabi north Indian fine dine restaurant in the 3rd floor of Orion mall. Ambience is quiet nice, classy perfect for corporate meetings for a date and for family outings. Hospitality is outstanding. Service is very good .  Had been with few friends enjoyed the evening with mind blowing dishes and drinks.  Drinks ordered were 1.Desi Mary Curry Patta Maarks. This is their one of the signature cocktail and presentation is unique. It is bloody mary spiked up with curry leaves and roasted mustard seeds.  2.Fruit Punch was awesome..perfectly blended.  3.Pineapple and Coconut Mojito This is fresh pineapple mixed with mint and coconut syrup with fizz.It was very nice.  4.Red Sangria was good too.  5.Imli ka boota also a signature cocktail and its good.  Appetizers ordered were  1.Palak Patta Chat: Crisp Palak leaves with gramflour coating topped with tamrind chutney and blended with yogrut and lil seasoning like onion tomato sev. Highly recommended. We enjoyed it.  2.Paneer Tikka Multani: Super fresh extra soft Panner chunks infused with fragrant herbs and a batter is coated and crisped in tandood. This was just melting in mouth.  3.Dahi ke kebab: My favourite and i reccomend this very much. Smooth Hung curd with cardamom and coriander crafted into kebabs and golden fried and served with pudina chutney.  4.Hara Bara Kebab: Spinach mashed green peas and panner kebabs added spices and herbs and grilled on a pan.  5.Khumb ki tikki : This is a mushroom dish where it is finely chopped and made as patty stuffed with herbs and cheese and grilled on a Pan.  They have introduced new Menu...Sip and Eat In which we tried Papdi Chat Mattha. Where in it is served in a mocktail glass where we can sip as well as eat. This is unique.  Coming to Maincourse Assorted bread basket was too good. Hot Soft rotis naans and Laccha Parathas.  Dal Punjab Grill was good. Made of of urad dal soaked and cooked in mustard oil with tomato puree and cream.  Subziyaan De Millniyaan was a dry subzi with broccoli beans carrot. It was good too.  Coming to Veg Dum Biriyani...It was nice but can be improved more.  Perfect Dinner ends with Perfect Deserts.  Rasmalai was soft and rich.  Litche ki Tehri was unique.  Gulabjamoon had three flavours ( Pista, Nutella and regular) Hot and yummy.  Pan Shots were offered as complimentary.  Had a complete satisfaction and very good time. Will surely visit again to try other dishes."

5.0,This is a rarest of Punjabi fine dine resto I have come across Bengaluru Located at Orion mall. Got high recommended from friend who has tried their food.. Ordered paneer tikka Multani and veg kur Kuri the taste was awesome Main we order mix veg and Dal fry were amazing Service was excellent too Love you be here soon Thank you team
2.0,"Pathetic seating arrangement. We were 6 of us and they joined a table for 4 and a table for 2 for us. This would make sense if the length of the tables was same. The table for 2 was much smaller than the table for 4 which caused a lot of inconvenience. The staff said they would switch the smaller table with a bigger one once a table was clear and this was not done. We are all over 6 and our hands kept colliding while eating.  Coming to the quantity, we ordered 3 starters and only the broccoli was actually enough for all six of us. For mains we ordered 2 portions of paneer makhani and one portion of daal tadka which tasted very average. Have had the same kind of food at a lot of restaurants which were much better and worth the money but this place has no value for money. This was our first and last time to this place. Would never suggest anyone to go here"
5.0,Wonderful place to relax and speand ur weekend. We were attended by rockstar Mr.Sabuj. really good service . Highly impressive .he was kind enough to get the drinks as per our taste ..overall great experience..ambience was great .....service was excellent. ...... Thanks for super Sabuj. Will visit again
4.0,It is a royal restaurant in the Orion mall. The food is really good in both quality and quantity. Service is worth appreciation. It's a good place for lunch.
4.0,Had been for lunch on 25/Aug/2018 with 4 of us from office.. Food was good and ambience is awesome... Quite overpriced but service was too good. Options for vegetarians are less. But staff was very curtious
5.0,"So one Friday night, after a lavish dinner, my friend and I decide to go for some drinks. We had heard about Punjab Grill from our friends and decided to see the place with such high ratings for ourselves.  Food: We did not order any. However, we were offered complimentary munchies to go along with our drinks.  Drinks: We ordered two of each: OBAN 14YO, Jaigermeister and Cointreau. The Cointreau was one of the best liqueurs we had- both in terms of taste and the experience of gulping a fire-shot.  Service: par excellence. We were served by Bikas, who was very understanding and patient with our enquiries. His service is something to be experienced and not to be just read about in a review. So go ahead and ask for him the next time you are at this place.  Ofcourse it helped that both of us had Zomato Gold, so the bill did not burn a hole in our pockets."
5.0,"Great food, and quality service from Sabuj. The Chicken Mallai Tikka is delicious and the butter naan is wholesome. Definitely recommend this place"
5.0,Food and service was amazing...Sabuj was best host  Starter and main course were all delicious. Loved the butter chicken...  A must place to visit

5.0,"I was planning to visit this gem for a long time. Finally visited yesterday.  This legendary north Indian food chain serves mouth-watering food with a classy and cosy ambience. They are is partially fine dining I would say, with extremely courteous and amicable staff. I choose to rate them 4.5 but since there is no provision for such rating I would go for 5. That slight deduction in point is due to their high pricing and the main course are not being so up tothe mark, despite some brilliant presentation. Also, I would say, though their cocktails which I tried was nice but their selection needs to improve.  We started off with the drinks:  Cocktails:  Imle ka boota : A whiskey-based cocktail with perfect blending of spices and of course the tamarind which steals the show.A perfect start.  Desi Merry Curry Patta : Try it if you like martini . I liked it but not that great it tasted.  Red wine Sangria: It was good. Im always a sangria lover. But it could have been better, few fruits were missing though.  We also had one whiskey based drink comprise of litchi and some other fruit: it was also very refreshing. I think it is pineapple & Litchi whiskey  Mocktails :  Pineapple and coconut mojito: It was very refreshing and tasted awesome. Perfect blending of the duo.  Fruit Punch was very nice.  Papdi chat mocktail was a bit let down. It was just a chaat in a liquid form.  I would definitely recommend Imlek a boota and pineapple and litchi whiskey to everyone.  Now comes the food.  Here is few of my recommendations:  Chaamp Tajdar  delicious and flavourful Lamb Chops infused with flavours from cloves, black cardamom and kasoori methi. Nice way to start our dinner.  Paneer Tikka Multani  Soft, tender and tasty. Tthe quality of the Paneer is really good. This Tikka was great because of the good quality in-house paneer.  Dahi ka Kebab  Another filling and flavourfull dish. Mildly spiced and melt in the mount, topped with an almond for presentation.  Palak Patta chaat : It was one of the finest chaat I have had. Moderately spicy this dish is a gem. What blew my mind was their presentation of this item.  Tandoori Jheenga - Loved this mild and balanced spiced grilled prawn dish. The grill was perfect and so does the spices.  Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill - A nice and spicy Punjabi Chicken Tikka, nice soft and juicy, succulent chunks of chicken. Grilled to perfection.  Kumbh ki tikki: mushroom based starter. It was okiesh. Not that great.  For the main course:  Dal Punjab Grill  It was good , I would say , but could have been better. Somehow black lentils are not well mashed.  Raarhya Meat - This delicious lamb dish was the star of the night. Marrow filled shanks and minced mutton cooked in a rich and spicy gravy.  Mutton Biryani  Unexpected shocker.I didnt expected a Punjabi restaurant to have a good Biryani. Though It was a bit on the dry side, but I liked it.  Subz Di mallenya : Basically a mixed veg preparation, it was ok.  Assorted breads: breads were soft and properly made.   Among the desserts  We had  Rasmalai, Litchi ki tehri and 3 (chocolate, vanilla and gulab) flavoured gulab jamun:The Rasmalai was good, but the gulab jamun was the star in the dessert section.Litchi ki tehri was also drool-worthy.    Finally we had Paan shot. It was awesome. Everyone should try this.  Thanks to Chef for such wonderful food and special thanks to vikas, and madhu for their awesome serviceand hospitality."

4.0,One of the best meals i have had is definitely from here! To start of with the staff is extremely friendly ^_^ The kheera with jeera(Mocktail)is definitely something you should try. Non-veg platter was totally worth it(Especially the tender mutton chops ) The mutton biryani was cooked to perfection.For the dessert the kulfi falooda was average not something you should try out. Food: 4/5 Taste:4/5 Ambience:3.5/5
3.0,Visited Punjab Grill.The place looks very nice & posh bt the prices were too high.The food was ok kinds.They cn actually improve it a lot.Service was very nice.If the food & price was good enough I would love to go thr.
5.0,"Visited the Punjab Grill  The place was quite crowded but we managed to get a table without a prior reservation.  We had Assorted Bread Basket, Meat Punjab Grill, Non Vegetarian Platter, & Paneer Lababdar.  The food was good but the service could be quicker & more attentive.  The lighting is dim to create a relaxed dining ambience  The food was nice especially the non vegetarian kebab platter was relished by all. Though not much of a mutton lover my son and I enjoyed the succulent mutton.  The biryani had a delicious aroma and was devoured by the young boys quickly.  Overall well satisfied.."

3.0,"Punjab grill...the name itself was enough for me to visit this place...this was one of my favorite place...the kormangala branch...bt the one opened in Orion is not good. Ambience is like a normal average Indian restaurant...it dint give me a feel of fine dining as it's listed under that class. It was like a fish market... tables so close to each other...no privacy at all. Next let's come to food...dishes I wanted to order were out of stock...however the staff was pleasing enough to convince me to order something else and I agreed upon...we ordered soya chaap..which turned out to be very good. We also ordered few mocktails- popcorn shake (really good and tasty), rola cola (perfect summer drink) and the papdi chat mattha(seemed to be very unique but dint turn out that well). Then came the main course. We ordered paneer lababdar. I expected creamy paneer curry but what was served was not up to expectations...rotis were soft. Service was good. As per the ambience and the food, found not worth the price...it had set my expectations so high from the kormangala branch that I dint like this branch. However, the staff is very courteous, welcoming and good. U can visit if u want to for food...bt can try other options as well! Ambience:1/5 Food:3.5/5 Staff:4/5 Price:3/5"

5.0,"On the occasion of Independence Day, I happened to be at Orion Mall with my family and was looking for a fine dining restaurant within the mall for lunch. That is when I came across Punjab Grill.  We opted for their Independence Day special buffet. I have tried a lot of buffet places in the city, but this place needs a special mention because of the quality of food that they have maintained from the starters to the main course! Most buffet places gives a feel of mass cooked food. But after a long time, I found a 'melt in your mouth' experience with Kababs served in a buffet starter. The mutton sheek kabab was definitely one of the best I have tried in town. Also kudos to the 'ever so ready to serve you' and smiling staff. If we asked them to refill something that got over in the main course, they not only got it refilled, but also came and served it individually on the table. Overall it was a nice experience and I would love to try this place again.  Food: 5 Service: 5 Ambience: 4 Value for Money : 4"
5.0,Awsm hospitality and perfect representative Mr Anuj .... thanks Panjab Grill for such a special food along with best staff Anuj Food was hygienic and with awsm taste. Thanks

1.0,"Years of unmatched taste and the best place to eat authentic North Indian/punjabi food when it was in Koramangala ... it was my family's favourite joint in Blore and then we were told the place has shifted to Orion mall... we went all the way there and were utterly disappointed with the ambience, service and above all the taste of food. It was below average for the same signature dishes that carried a delectable taste earlier...later we found out that the place is no longer owned by Jiggs Kalra. So if you don't want to burn a hole in your pockets and expect pathetic food ... explore better options.Even their trademark Paan shot/ refreshener was something that we could not finish !!! I really miss the old joint and the lovely memories it brings back to us."

5.0,"A lot of restaurants serve good food, but they don't have very good service- Wolfgang Puck  And, that my dears is quite an interesting truth. Ive been to many restaurants and the food has been great, but the staff has been disoriented. Either, youre overconfident about your food pulling people or youre really bad at your operational skills. But Punjab Grill, is one restaurant that really made me realise just how much more you can savour from a dine in experience if youre matre d is right.   About Punjab Grill : The Restaurant boasts of a traditional Mughlai cuisine, with recipes trying to be as authentic as possible without adding too much of drama to them.   Hospitality: I, was highly pleased with our matre d Vikas for looking after us so well and always asking us at proper intervals if the food was fine. Not only was he observant, but was also extremely a well spoken gentleman. Even the Manager, Mr. Madhu made sure that we enjoyed our meal, making arrangements for a better seating arrangement as we were with children. Last but not the least Chef Bipin, who served us such delicious food that we just couldnt stop licking our spoons clean.   Ambiance: The yellow lights with the chandeliers, made you think you were dining in one of the dining rooms of the Maharajahs. The vibe of the place is extremely mellow & relaxed.   The Grub Story : We started our journey with their newest addition to the menu & ended with their signature dishes.   1. Popcorn Shake : A complete kid pleaser & something that you must try if you love caramels & popcorn.   2. Margarita Merry : The delectable concoction of tomatoes, chilies and salt in a non alcoholic base made this my favourite.   3. Palak Pata Chaat : Your Chaat with a twist of crunchy & firm Spinach leaves.   4. Tandoori jhinga : Beautifully marinated jumbo prawns in a blend of cardamom & lemon.   5. Salmon Tikka : Delicately seasoned & extremely light on the palate.   6. Paneer Tikka Multan : This I believe is a must have. The Paneer was done so well & is made in house. The light flavours of marinade, the perfect char. What more can you ask for?   7. Nalli Gosht : Flavourful and an extremely thick and delicious gravy which was filled with the juices of the Nalli. Perfect with a garlic or a butter naan.   8. Gulab Jamun : Made beautifully and filled with different flavours in each of the 3 Jamuns. This is a must have.   Noteworthy mentions : Mutton Biryani,  khumbh ki Tikki, Chakundar ki Tikki, Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill, Jalebi Rabdi.   __________________________________  Verdict : An extremely great place to visit with family and friends. The vibe is very friendly and if you have great food and great service in mind, then this is it.                                             theplatememoirs.wordpress.com"
5.0,"Punjab Grill is that kind of a place which would make you forget about the ambience you're dining in with the help of the food they would serve. Having said that, there's nothing wrong with the ambience either. After a very long time I finally dined at a place which I could rate as a 5 without a second thought. So on a happy Friday night, me and my fellow foodies dropped in here for a lavish dinner. And here goes my amazing food experience at Punjab Grill.  If you fancy some good old braised lamb chops cooked in authentic Punjabi style, this is the place to be. They call it the Chap Tajdar. The meat is extremely succulent and perfectly flavored with all the Indian spices and ghee. Take a bite, let the food rest in your mouth and you'd find it melting automatically.  Tandoori Jhinga (prawns) is another heart stealer. They were smoky, ghee laden and soft at the same time. Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill was equally delectable; slightly charred but moist on the inside. There are very few places which could woo me with their vegetarian starters. Punjab Grill is definitely one of them. We had the Dahi ka Kebab and Paneer Tikka. Both were soft and flavorsome with the right amount of spices. I had paired up my food with a glass of Jacob's Creek Shiraz Cabernet, which was the best decision ever.  For mains, we had Dal Punjab Grill, Murgh Makhani, Paneer Lababdar, Raar Mutton along with an assortment of Indian breads and Mutton Biryani. Each and every item I had transported me back to the days spent in Chandigarh. Be it the softness of the meat and paneer or the generous usage of butter or the smoothness of the gravies, the food couldn't have been any more authentically Punjabi. The Dal specially made me lick my fingers clean.  Finally it was time for desserts. We had Jalebi Rabdi and Rasmalai. The Jalebi, dipped in a saffron syrup and topped with pistachio were very very crisp. When paired with the thick Rabdi, it tasted heavenly. While the Jalebi had enchanted me already, the Rasmalai was no less a star. The sweetness was subtle which I really liked and one could easily cut through the rasgulla.  We were already filled up to the brim when they brought in paan shots. I've never had them before and I was pretty impressed. A paste of paan leaves mixed with ice cream and gulkand acted as the perfect palate cleanser at the end of such an elaborate 3 course meal!  Apart from the food, the hospitality at this place is top notch. The servers were very polite, friendly and helpful. I am definitely coming back to this place with more people! :)"
5.0,"Let me start off by saying that, these people have just aced it when it comes to Punjabi food in Bangalore. I would like to add one more point here, their cocktail menu is extremely unique and most of it have an Indian touch to it making it more suitable to the Indian tastebuds. So I basically decided to dine here the other night with my group of like minded people and the experience was something which would make us go back for more. The Ambiance is good but I would love it if they make even more catchy. The service and staff were top notch. They sure know how to treat their guests. So I had a nice meal which I would discuss in detail further in my review.   Highlights of the place   Great Ambiance.  Extensive Menu for authentic Punjabi cuisine.  Amazing staff and even better service.  Top notch Hospitality.  Costlier side of dining.  One of the better F&B in town  Innovative Cocktails.  What I loved n would recommend?  Nimboo Ka Caprioska- By far the best Cocktail I've had. This thing will surely be in the back of my head for a long time to come. The tangi taste of Lemon achar blends in to be the best Caprioska you'll drink Paneer Tikka Multani- Better Paneer Tikka you'll find, especially in this side of town. Dahi Ke kabab- Perfectly made kebab super tasty Dahi filing. The Mint Chutney blends very well with this. Paneer Labradar- The best Gravy with their amazing basket of Rotis. A very satisfied 5/5 for this one. Rabdi with Jalebi and Rasmalai- Both the desserts were just great, gives an amazing ending to such an sumptuous meal  What I would ask them to improve?  Frankly I think they have got everything right. Nothing I could point out which wasn't right.   Other things I had with no compliments/complaints:   Starters: Palak Patta chat Main Course: Dal Punjabi grill.  Overall an Amazing and authentic experience. I'm surely coming back for more. I would recommend this to be the best and authentic North Indian outlet in Orion mall and Malleshwaram. I understand it's on the higher side of dining but I feel it's worth it.  Ambiance: 4/5 Food& Beverages: 4.5/5 Service&Staff: 4.5/5 Value for money: 3.5/5"

5.0,"Recently I have visited several Punjabi/North Indian Restaurant in Bangalore serving good food with a casual ambience. But Punjab Grill took that to a different level with their fine dining experience. The food is top notch with extremely courteous and helpful staff. I would have rated this place 4.5, but since Zomato does not allow you to rate 4.5 I chose to rate them 5. That half point I should have deducted for the high prices and the cocktails not being that up tothe mark despite some brilliant presentation. Also, being a fine dining restaurant the collection of wines and beers need a lot of improvement. I have no complaintsregarding the food department - it is absolutely brilliant.  My recommendations for the food here are:  Chaamp Tajdar - Extremely flavourful and tender Lamb Chops with flavours from cloves, black cardamom and kasoori methi grilled to perfection. This was the star of the night.  Paneer Tikka Multani - If the quality of the Paneer is really good, I like Paneer dishes more than chicken. This Paneer Tikka was perfect all because of the good quality in-house paneer.  Dahi ka Kebab - Another wonderful vegetarian dish. Mildly spiced and melt in the mount, topped with an almond for presentation.  Tandoori Jheenga - Loved this mild and balanced spiced grilled prawns dish. The grill was perfect.  Tawa Jheenga - Tawa grilled prawns with tangy flavours. The size of the prawns in this dish seemed a little larger than the Tandoori Jheenga.  Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill - A nice and spicy Punjabi Chicken Tikka, you cannot go wrong with this.  Paneer Lababdar - A good option for vegetarians since the paneer quality is really good. Must have with their Naans.  Dal Punjab Grill - I liked the dal here, but felt that it could have been better if was a little less buttery.  Raarhya Meat - This was another mouthwatering lamb dish that night. Marrow shanks and Lamb chopscooked with lamb keema in a rich and spicy gravy.  Mutton Biryani - I have never expected a Punjabi speciality restaurant to have a good Mughlai style Biryani. These guys did an amazing job with a perfectly spiced Mutton Biryani with tender pieces of mutton.  Dangar Dose - This cocktail served in a syringe was pretty good but the portion was too small for the price. It was a tequila-based cocktail with flavours of kaffir lime and orange.  Among the desserts tried the Rasmalai and Jalebi Rabri. The Rasmalai was pretty good, but the Jalebi Rabdi was the best. The Jalebi was crisp even after it was dipped in the rabdi, made an awesome combination.  Thanks to Chef Bipin for such wonderful food and special thanks to Bikash, Sunil and Justin for their awesome service."
5.0,"A good place , great ambience , great taste and we were served by Mr. Prabhat who treated us really well ! Must visit place  the chicken and mutton were really well cooked and tasty"
4.0,"Intended Rating: 4.5 Biryani, tikkas and tadkas your thing? Then Punjab Grill is where you should head for some great food affair. Big Punjabi flavours are all the rage on this spiffy restaurants menu. The melt-in-the-mouth Dahi Ke Kebab and the spicy Chaamp Tajdar will get your meal off to a rollicking start.  Detailed Review:  What TummyTumms Liked..?? Nimbu Ka Achaar Caipiroska: The classic caipiroska with tangy Indian lemon pickle won everybodys heart. Our group ended up ordering the same for themselves. That tangy flavour though  Chaamp Tajdar: Lamb chops well marinated with cloves, black cardamom & Kasoori Methi, braised and grilled in tandoor totally bowled us over..!! Total Winner Tawa Jheenga: The size of the prawns and the spicy marination..yummmmzzaaa!! Truly Punjabi Raarhya Meat: Quite Filling and certainly one of the best option for non m-vegetarians to order for their main course. Dahi Ke Kebab: melt-in-the-mouth yummy Daal Punjab Grill: My favourite dish off the menu was the rich and creamy Daal paired best with butter naan. Jalebi with Rabdi: Do Keep space in your tummy for this super delicious combo. Crispy jalebi dipped in tempting rabdi was the best ending of our fabulous dinner.  What TummyTumms Didnt Like..?? Costing: I found it bit over priced especially the cocktails. Tandoori Jheenga: Bland   Other Good Things To Order..?? Paneer Tikka Multani: Huge and so, if youre opting for a meal for two, this will take up quite a bit of your tummy space. And I suggest you finish this one right away, since it may turn cold and rubbery. Murg Makhani: made up of Tandoori Chicken that floats in a tomato and butter gravy thats made richer by the addition of a smooth cashew paste Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill: Well marinated. The flavours of cream, cheese and garlic totally hits your tastebuds (in a good way guys!) Paneer Lababdar: Pretty good options for vegetarians to go with if youre looking for something with gravy and  to go with the Lehsuni Naan. Mutton Biryani: Flavours were on point. Quantity could have been more though. Rasmalai: Not the best one to review this particular dessert as I am partial towards it. I love Rasmalai anywhere and everywhere.  TummyTumms Scoreboard: Taste: 4.5/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Value For Money: 3.5/5 (Found it tad bit expensive)   If you love yourself a good ok greasy North Indian feast with plenty of classics thrown in, head straight to Punjab Grill."

5.0,"As we all know, Punjabi food plays a very important role in indian cuisine and and one of the most captivating and hyped delicacies to all the indian food lovers. Most of the restaurants serve punjabi food but there are hardly few places where you can find authentic punjabi delicacies, feeling extrmely delighted  to    Say that PUNJAB GRILL is one of such places offering true punjabi cuisine. AMBIENCE: Located in Orion Mall, Malleshwaram , this is a fine dining restaurant with spacious arrangement and luxurious seating arrangements. Decorated with pretty light and wooden roof panels and gold partition lining: A royal experience overall.  FOOD n DRINKS : Tried a no. of starters, main course and desserts all are equally well in terms of taste and presentations as well.  Starters: Palak Patta Chaat : Crispy spinach and gram flour papad, topped with yoghurt, tamarind chutney and spices. Tandoori Jheenga: Prawns are grilled in tandoor, spices are very well balanced. Tawa Jheenga: Tastes equally well. Paneer Tikka Multani: Batter Coated soft paneer chunks- a very good option for veg diners. Dahi ke Kebab: Fried Kebab made with hung curd and spices- another great veg starter. Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill: Spicy chicken chunks lightly grilled in tandoor. Chaamp Tajdar: The best starter of the day- Grilled lamb chops flavoured with cloves, cardamom, kasuri methi, a true taste of punjab you can get from this dish. The chef played with the flavours really well. I can hardly find such places where lambs are well cooked, but here it was just perfect! A must try for true hard core non veg admirers.  Drinks: Had one Stella Artois beer and tried one of their speciality cocktail: Nimbu ka Achaar Caipiroska- A vodka based cocktail with flavours of lemon pickle.  Main Course: Mutton Biriyani: This mutton dum biriyani is one absolutely worthy dish to try for , juicy spicy tender mutton pieces served with saffron hued basmati rice. Melange of flavours are used in this dish which takes it to the whole new level.  Raarhya Meat: Lamb Chops served in a curry spiced with the flavours of cloves, cardamom, cinnamon etc.  Desserts: No matter how full a foodie is, he/she has always a place for dessert in the tummy :P. Punjab grill serves two very favourite desserts of mine and needless to say all are tasted absolutely heaven.  Jalebi with Rabdi: As we know rabdi is one very famous indian dessert which is made by condensing milk by slow cooking method until it turns pinkish and when this teams up with crispy fried jalebis dipped in chasni/sugar syrup, it just takes you to the heaven. The chef justified with the dish really well. Rasmalai: This particular indian dessert makes our mouth watery just by its name. Flattened chhana balls are cooked in sugar syrup and dipped into milk ; saffron and pistachios adds richness to it at one another level.  SERVICE: Very good in terms of hospitality. Staffs are very well trained, organized, courteous and knowledgeable. An impeccable fine dining experience!  My rating: Food- 4.5/5 Ambience: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5 Value for money: 4.5/5"

Only a few restaurants really understand how important a good service is. Caring staff who bring your food with lighting speed. Heaven if you're grill lover.

5.0,"Guchchi as the name itself brings a lot of brand value and so is the mushroom which is grown wild in some regions like Kangara Valley, Jammu and Kashmir,   Manali and other parts of Himachal Pradesh after the snowfall period.  This mushrooms cannot be cultivated commercially and these elusive mushrooms are hand picked by hawk eyed villagers for their livelyhood as they grow wild.   Guchchi mushrooms usually grow in clusters on logs of decaying wood or decaying leaves and even in humus soil.   The mushrooms are strewn into a garland and hung over fire to dry and a lot of effort is required to retain their pleated honeycomb texture.   It can take months before enough is collected, dried and available for sale in the market.   We had an esteem privelage to dig into this rare delicacy at Punjab Grill which marks indelible taste prints on your palette. The Pulao was simply divine with the rare Guchchi mushrooms   stuffed with milk cake and delicate spices.  Thanks to chef Shaikh Khurseed Ali and courteous staff for the wonderful time we had."

They had quite a few people waiting to grad their seats. This place is definitely a fine dining Experience in a mall. Convenient in multiple ways. The hospitality of these folks are mention worthy.

4.0,It was typically a mommy date after a good movie you obviously tend to crave for good food so we opted to have our lunch in Punjab Grill .   This Restaurant showcases the grandeur and delicacy of Punjab in every way from decors to the seating also the serving  and literally in every way !   We wanted to have some good non-vegetarian lunch so ordered a BONELESS CHICKEN STARTER and SPECIAL CHICKEN BIRYANI so both the dishes tasted pretty well the savour and the pattern of chicken was finger licking good .  There was no space left in tummy because one plate of starter and the main course makes you full for two people !   For digestion thought of taking lemon soda but the waiter suggested to take some mojito and the mojito was so satisfying .  Overall the restaurant is a great place to visit if you wanna try some good Punjabi food !

2.0,"Once upon a time,on a Sunday,I had been to Orion mall, I thought this place,Punjabi Grill,would be awesome,but heres my experience: Cons: 1.I went for the buffet option,never did anybody tell me all the items available in the buffet,people used to randomly come out of the kitchen and serve. 2.The curries and rice were very limited,the fish wasnt cooked well.The veg biriyani didnt taste so great. 3.There werent any attractive desserts. Pros: 1.The mutton starter tasted great. 2.The salads were good.  Overall,I had to pay approx. 1300rs(buffet +mineral water),Id like to say that its not worth it because the buffet is too limited,in terms of the number of items.It was an unsatisfactory experience."

3.0,good but a bit rich and heavy..
4.0,"This outlet of Punjab Grill is very close to my place and in fact I had seen it from out quite a few times. Finally came here for dinner.  It really was a very good experience. For drinks, we had two beers, three vodka, meetha patha mojito and tola cola.  For appetizers we had hara bhara kebab and murgh tikka punjab grill, which were one of the best best.  Main course was really good with roomali roti, tandoori roti, bhare amritsari kulche aloo, butter kulcha, dal punjab grill and bhindi masala.  For the price you pay, the quantity was sufficient. In fact more only you can say. Again, that depends from person to person.  The staff, the setup, everything is really nice. People like Prabhat, Manoj and few others were really nice. Yes, the rates are bit on the steep side, but I guess spending so much amount once in a while is acceptable. Especially when the whole experience was this good."

5.0,"Located on the third floor of Orion Mall @ brigade Gateway. This place provides you with one of the best authentic punjabi cuisine in town. This place serves alcohol as well.  The interiors are simple and sophisticated decorated with chandeliers,  photos of sindhi and punjabi culture.  The service was excellent from the moment you get inside the premises and till you walk out. The staffs are courteous and friendly. They welcome and greet you in a Indian traditional way.   What we had? Drinks:  1. Punjab kranti : A special cocktail with vodka base with orange juice,jalapeos and chat masala 2. Lemon Capriosika : A typical vodka cocktail with lemon pickle with amazing chatpata flavors. 3. kesar Pista Lassi : One of the authentic lassi in town which was thick and creamy content unlike other places around.  Food (Starters):  a. Palak Patta Chat :   Fried Palak leaves topped with mashed potato, chutney and curd. A must try  b. Salmon Tikka: The name of dish talks for itself, fish was  marinated and cooked to perfection. c. Punjabi Grill Tikka : Authentic chicken tikka with flavours all the way from Punjab. d. Tandoori Pomfret : The fish itself states it all, flavours were amazing with good spices. Masala and Marination was perfectly cooked. e. Malai chicken Tikka : chicken marinated with creamy cashew paste and cheese served along with mint chutney. Perfectly balanced.  Food(Main Course) -> Punjab Grill Special Daal : A traditional dish served here and one of the best sellers. The daal had authentic punjabi twist to it. One of the Must try for daal lovers out there!  -> Guchchi Pulao : A highly recommended dish, this delicacy has very strong flavours. The truffle is compressed with cream cotton cheese and Spices.   -> Raarhya Meat : Mutton kheema induced in mutton chunks and the masala adding great flavours to it. Got along with Garlic Naan and rice.  Dessert  i) Phirni : One of my favourites and a must try.  Authentic and Rich in taste! ii) Lychee with Rabdi :innovative and good!   Verdict: Food 5/5 VFM 4/5 ( Pricing seems to be on the higher end for obvious reasons i.e Location etc etc) Service 5/5   KUDOS to chef Mr. Ali and Mr. Manju for providing us a great hospitality!"
4.5,"Punjab grill is a very well known brand in terms of authentic Punjabi food pan India and also internationally! ! They serve a plethora of Punjabi food fare along with some fusionized cocktails. This outlet is located in Orion mall 3rd floor. The ambience is neat classy and small compared t o their other outlets. However the food is lipsmacking and amazing...kudos to chef Ali for such an amazing flavour and authentic taste. Coming to cocktails I tried their 1) lemon capriosika: amazing lemon pickle based cocktail. Loved the tangy flavours it offered. 2) kesar pista lassi: rich creamy and yummy.  3) Punjab krant: a Punjab grill special cocktail made with vodka , Orange juice chat masala and jalapenos. Coming to the food we started with 1) palak patta chat: fried spinach leaves topped with chutneys curd and seasined mashed potato. Lovely flavours.and a must try. 2) salmon tikka: the marinade was amazing and the fish was cooked so perfectly. 3) tandoori promfret: wow this was a marvel!  The masala was outright perfect! 4) Punjab grill special chicken tikka:  classic chicken tikka. 5) Malai chicken tikka: chicken marinated well with cream cashew paste and cheese.slightly on a sweeter edge Also the mint chutney served along with all this was too good. The main course is what impressed me more then the starters. We ordered for  1) Punjab grill special daal: this was a traditional classic daal makhni and oh this was the best dal.makhni I had in a really Long time. The taste was rich authentic and worth the price. I just couldn t ask for more.in fact I happen to take a serving of daal and ate it just like that.  2) guchchi pulao: what a vegetarian marvel! I think this is the best dish at Punjab grill and shouldn'tbe missed. The rich truffle is stuffed with cream cottage cheese and spices and made as a pulao. I just couldn't ask for more.  3) raarhya meat: mutton kheema induced with mutton peices. In rich masala. Went so well with the pulao and garlic naan.  Last but not the least it was time for dessert. 1) phirni: was amazing  2) lychee with rabdi: not a bad combo at all.  Verdict: The pricing is on a higher edge, however the taste its worth it. Restroom isn't attached in the restaurant , one had to use it in mall . The service is fabulous, specially Mr manju who was an amazing host."

1.0,Worst food ever and hospitality is worst. The buffet is too pricey for the food they serve. Starters are served on the table but you figuratively have to beg them to refill your plate. Waiters are not at all attentive. They served mutton curry in main course which is under cooked. When I attempted to tell them about this they didnt even bother to listen. Never ever go to this place.

5.0,"""The secret of success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside - Mark Twain. Punjab is not just on top of the India Map but is also at the helm of affairs when it comes to food. Punjabi delicacies have played a vital role in shaping Indian Cuisine over years and is always one step higher on the culinary ladder. There are very few places that you can blindly trust to always be flawlessly spot on/ top notch any or every time that you dine there. Punjab Grill is one such restaurant that has become my favorite and among the best in the North Indian category. Numerous awards and accolades awarded to it bears testimony to my statement.  Food- Exceptionally delicious. Impressive Presentation. Every dish on the menu is of impeccable quality. Mocktails are splendid and refreshing. To begin with, The Mutton Yakhni Shorba was very appetizing. The Papdi Chaat was so fabulous that it deserves a special mention. Moving on the the more sophisticated and actual starters,  Murgh Tikka was Incredible. Perfectly grilled in the tandoor to melt in the mouth. Their signature. Highly Recommended.  Tawa Jheenga was phenomenal. Soft, juicy and nicely seasoned Nimbu Achari prawns made on a pan. One of the best Ive eaten which really excites the palate.  Sheekh Kebabs were remarkable. A unique blend of piquancy and richness.  Norwegian Salmon Tikka was outstanding. It was fresh, tender and had An outburst of flavors that soaked in right through the last bite.  Loved the brilliantly marinated and slow cooked Raan e sikendari (lamb leg) that was succulent.  Chicken Lababdar Gravy was stupendous. Creamy with the right balance of spice, taste, texture and consistency of a true Indian Curry.  Mutton Biryani was fantastic. Large pieces of meat mixed well in an excellent masala and aromatic fragrant rice.  Finally, the Indian sweets for desserts were a pure pleasure to indulge in. Gulab Jamun was stuffed with chocolate and topped with nuts to provide heavenly bliss.  However the lamb Chops were average. Expected better. Ajwani Fish tikka was ordinary and can be improved. (8/10)  Service- Exemplary. Wonderful Hospitality. Personal touch by the Executive Chef  Mr Khursheed Ali made it more enjoyable. Quintessential fine dining experience. Staff is well organized, attentive, courteous, efficient, quick, friendly, highly trained and knowledgeable. Commendable coordination. Waiters go the extra mile to make the guest feel special. Reservation Recommended. Orion Mall Basement Parking Available. (9/10)  Ambience- Royal Exuberance. Amazing interior decor that displays luxury and style. Well planned layout. Spacious Arrangement. Comfortable designer chairs for seating. Exquisite furniture. Great Hindi Music and Central air conditioning. Spectacular designer lights and chandeliers. Marvelous large photo frames of Kings. Elegant flooring and wall papers. Superb Wooden roof Panels and gold partitions along with Beautiful hanging artifacts add to the attractive look. A joyful atmosphere with relaxing vibes. (8/10)  Overall a delightful experience that was indeed a treat for the eyes and an extravagant feast for the tummy. Despite the pricing being on the higher expensive side, there is value for money and you will surely leave with absolutely no regrets. As a famous man once said "" Money cannot buy Happiness but it can buy sumptuous food to relish, which is the same thing"". Will definitely visit again to satisfy cravings.                                             foodadventureindia.wordpress.com"

Nestled on the top floor of Orion Mall,this place boasts of a elegant decor with the interiors done so well with the perfect lighting.  The place can accommodate around 60-70 pax at a time.  The Service is seamlessly flawless with the staff being well groomed.  The place also has a full fledged bar in the premises.  The man behind the scene-Chef Ali needs to be appreciated for his innovative presentation and delicious food.  The Cocktails    Jalandhar Express-the beer with white spirits dint strike the right chord   Desi Mary Curry Patha Maarke-Loved this drink.  Godfather-Must try   The Starters   Seafood platter-consisted of ajwaini fish tikka,Tawa machi,salmon Tikka and Tandoori Jheenga-sea food lovers delight.  Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill-must try..perfect.  Dahi Chaat-this humble starter tantalises your tastebuds... please try  Raan-E-Sikandari-not so great.  Raunaqeen Seekhan-good   Main course    Soya Chaamp Masala-a surprisingly good dish,went well with the Indian bread  Kadhai Murgh-a joy to eat a dish so heavenly that you will be craving for more   Kheema Roti-liked it.

Gulab Jamun -White chocolate  -Dark Chocolate  Both the white and dark chocolate stuffed Jamuns were just too wonderful and added to the charm of the evening   A evening for 2 would cost around Rs 7000-8000/- with a couple of starters.  Reservations recommended   My Ratings   Food-4.5/5   Service-5/5  Ambience-5/5  Value for Money-4/5"
5.0,"Located on the top floor of Orion Mall at Rajajinagar-Malleshwaram Road,this place draws crowd from the top class of society. The place is located in the food court of the Mall.  The Interiors are done to such great perfection that it lives up-to the expectation of a fine dine restaurant and lifts the mood of the diners.  The ambience is super fine with apt lighting,the chandeliers add to the richness and the seating comfortably made.  The Service is excellent with all the staff trained to do the traditional Namaskara when they welcome you IN or walk OUT. The servers/Managers know the food they serve and put you at ease in choosing the food.  Chef ALI here takes pride in whipping up some of the best lip smacking dishes.  The place boasts of a full fledged Bar and the bartender sure has some tricks up his sleeve to impress the patrons.  The Cocktails tried were-  1.Jalandhar Express- a drink with all the white spirits viz Vodka,Tequila,White Rum,Gin with Beer in it. Loved the presentation but strongly felt that the BEER killed the drink  2.Desi Mary Curry Patha Maarke- this was too good on presentation and taste as well. 3.Godfather-MUST TRY. Small,Dynamic yet too tasty.  The Starters tried were-  1.Seafood platter-comprised of ajwaini fish tikka,Tawa machi,salmon Tikka and Tandoori Jheenga. For all the Seafood lovers out there... MUST TRY. 2.Tawa Jheenga-Never Tried and now Never Forgotten. @CHEF ALI-TAKE A BOW...you have taken the dish to a all new level. 3.Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill- Excellent. Cooked to perfection with the right spices and Succulent meat so well that it was a absolute joy to relish. 4.Dahi Chaat- ordered twice... Delivered BANG ON -taste as well as presentation  5.Raan-E-Sikandari- have tasted better. 6.Raunaqeen Seekhan- average   The Main course tried were  1.Soya Chaamp Masala- a pleasant surprise on taste. How can a vegetarian dish be so good... eat it to believe it. Wow. 2.Kadhai Murgh-Show stopper for sure. Absolutely delicious and MUST TRY. 3.Kheema Roti-Innovative roti with kheema stuffed inside.Good.. 4.Dum ki Biryani-Mutton -The Biryani was good in its own league  5.Guchchi Pulao- this delicacy requires an acquired taste to appreciate it and I strongly felt that this was the best have ever tried of late. Oh My Food(OMF!).... Must try and highly recommended.  The Desserts tried were-  1.Phirni-served in a small tea glass,has a rich taste and is apt to end your meal. 2.Gulab Jamun -White chocolate stuffed inside the jamun and done right. -Dark Chocolate stuffed inside and I personally am in love with this dessert.  A evening for 2 would cost around Rs 6000 to 8000/- easily with a couple of cocktails.  Restrooms NOT AVAILABLE as it is located in the Mall.  Mall parking available..  As of me,would love to visit this mesmerising place on any given day.  Kudos to all the lovely supportive people running this place with pride and passion"

5.0,"Punjabi Fine Dining!  Being the only Indian Fine Dining restaurant in Malleshwaram, the Punjab Grill has large shoes to fill, and they do it in all elegance and style. They actually take it a step further and do it Punjabi style. Located in the Orion Mall, this is no food court. Decorated in rich Punjabi taste and portraits of warriors, the restaurant is a reflection class and luxury. The same exuberance is carried on in the menu curated by Ali, the head Chef here. He makes it a point to come out and talk to the customers, walk us through the dishes and make informed choices. The level of detail is amazing. Even a simple Fish Tikka has been prepared with Norvegian Salmon. And it is the best fish Tikka I have ever tasted. I'm getting ahead of myself. We started this food adventure with the Mutton Yakni Shorba. The spices were mellow and Shorba tasted of the finest mutton. This was followed by the Fish Amritsari, golden brown batter fried river fish(which was wonderful) and Salmon Tikka. We tried the Tandoori Soya Chaamp, which we wouldn't have guessed it was made of a soya, tasted amazing. For main course, the Bharne Amritsari Kulcha, which is a heavy keema Kulcha, reminds us of the rich Punjabi cuisine. Be warned that this is for ones with a large appetite. The Guchchi pulao was an exotic delight, with only a handful of restaurants serving this delicacy. We had the Fatewal Murg roast and Patiala Shahi Machchi. The chicken has a incredible spicy after taste. The fish had a lovely tomato gravy which went well with the pulao. The Dal Punjab grill was simple and mellow in flavor. The Indian palate requires a good dessert to complete a meal. The Gulab jamuns and Rasmalai are the best of desserts. But the Phirni stole the show for me. Not too sweet, not dull, just right amounts of yumminess. Punjab Grill reminds us of our royal food heritage, reminds us to pamper our tastebuds from time to time. I would love to embark on this food adventure from time to time!"
4.5,"4.5 One of my biggest challenges whilst shopping in a mall has been eating at the food court, it just doesnt appeal to me so as a result I eat at one of the cages or have to head out and dine elsewhere. On my recent visit to Orion mall, a friend recommended trying Punjab Grill while given it seem a little upscale and tad heavy on the wallet, I was more than willing to try it and im so glad I did. As soon as you enter the place you tend to immediately understand why it has such good ratings on Zomato, the place is perpetually crowded so expect a short wait time especially over the weekend, we dined here on a weekday and all tables were occupied. Special mention two my absolute favourites of the night nimbo ka achaar caiprioska and the Salmon Tikka The cocktail was one of the best I have had and the Salmon Tikka"
3.0,Expensive as hell for a restaurant which doesn't even have a washroom. Food doesn't reach the expectations. All the staff try to display a classy ambience to the restaurant. Good for fancy dates.
5.0,Food was awesome as usual. Bangalore's best Dahi ke kabab you can have. Sabuj served us well. Latest hindi music with good ambience. Perfect experience
3.0,"Food was decent, not worth the price at all I felt considering I go out n eat North Indian cuisine every Saturday for lunch. We ordered a couple of starters which were impressive  The 4 thirst quenchers/mocktails were average! Our main course were Butter Rotis n 2 types (Mushroom n Mixed veg that had paneer) of Veg gravy. Rotis are big and and soft, however the gravy was a little better than average, however, all in all for the price, not too okay going back there. The kulfi was good  Service was good as we had friendly staff who even pushed us to review them in a nice way"
5.0,Food was good and special thanks to Sabuj for superb service and for wonderfully experience. Keep the good work. Food was delicious & love the mocktails too

4.0,"Subuj service and recommendation was good .. all good try all types of food .. briyani was decent and grill I recommend all to try... Vegetarian will love all dishes,but for non vegetarian it's pretty ok"
5.0,"7 star experience as we were (unexpectedly) personally served by master chef Ali. Despite a buffet we ordered a la carte. Chef Ali took care of our sons food allergies and whipped up a dessert that was not available on the lunch menu. The cocktails were innovative and refreshing, the appetisers were gone in no time. Even a staid old palak paneer had a different twist - topped with roasted garlic gave it the rustic feel."
5.0,The Speciality cocktails are fantastic. Paneer Tikka and Butter Chicken are as good as they come. Paan-Shots were a delight. Some items are grossly overpriced else it's a great place.
4.5,Beautiful food and great service. We especially enjoyed the paneer starters which were melt in your mouth soft. Special mention to Sabuj who was impeccable in his service :)

5.0,"Wonderful experience, must try: malai tikka, Yakhni shorba, Yellow dal and jalebi with Rabri. Excellent service too. Thank you Sabuj! Definitely coming back."
3.0,"Was here for lunch today, took the buffet. The buffet spread was not that great, for the price the spread was small. The starters were good but were too late to arrive. If they prepare the food fresh thats ok but it took way too much time. The service in the beginning was way below par but one waiter with his smile and service changed my mood, if the management reads his name is  SABUJ. There was only 3 items for desserts and no ICE CREAM which for as posh a place for this is not acceptable. Was rating 2 but one plus star for SABUJ and his service."
5.0,Privileges of a Zomato card.. got a 2 + 2 on the Bloody Marys. Thanx Zomato   Their buffet is awesome... every dish was cooked to perfection... please do visit them..   Make sure to book a table else you might have to wait.. they are almost always crowded.. though they've crammed in a lot more tables than needed to accommodate ppl.. it's jus not enough.  Starters take some time to get to your table but it's worth the wait..
5.0,"Sabuj was exceptional in his service and suggestions. Great food and ambience. Anand suggested Murug Tikka which was excellent., sabuj suggested great desserts. Good experience."
4.0,Gives you a feeling of being in Punjab. This place has some great cocktails in some unique presentations. Not crowded during weekdays and you can enjoy a quite delicious meal.  The seafood platter is quite interesting. Prawns are great. The main course gravies are finger licking and adds to the Amritsari kulchas.

5.0,"Punjab Grill is not just another restaurant but an experience in Punjabi Cuisine. As I was part of a very exclusive invitee only dinner, it was apparent that this venue needed no introduction with all covers full and people waiting outside to grab a table. I was delighted by their customer service and welcomed with a grand reception by chef himself and was suggested the Punjabi Kranti cocktail to start with. We were served Lamb Chops and Fish Ajwain Tikka as starters. The Dal Punjab Grill was my ultimate favourite with the Keema Naan and some Murgh Roast Fatewal which was delectably divine. Then came the highly anticipated Mutton Biryani and I was awestruck by its aroma and flavours. We ended our evening with some traditional Gulab Jamun stuffed with Chocolate and Honey. Chef Khurshed and Chef Ali made sure everything was perfect and to the point. A very distinguished experience and definitely deserves mention as the only place in Orion Mall to eat."

Mutton was delicious, rest was decent enough. Unfortunate part was we got some non veg starter after we were done eating. Sad! I guess its because of the weekend rush... Also there were just 3 desserts- Jalebi, phirni and something ( i forgot).  Very much pleased with the service, especially Sunil, who served food with a smiling face. Liked the ambience."

4.0,"Post successful launch of their first outlet ,  F&B Retail Company launched the second outlet in Bangalore Punjab Grill.  Located inside Orion Mall, Malleshwaram Bangalore. Punjab Grill brings you real and authentic taste  of Punjab.   Punjab Grill serves and promise you best and pure authentic north India cuisine taste in royal way (in terms of taste and presentation as well)  Experience traditional flavours in the heart of Indias tech hub. By Punjab Grill - Gourmet Fine Dining. And its in huge space with the capacity of I guess 70-80 people.  Ambience wise they have amazing depict of royal Punjabi culture , loved the choice of interior which even make your visit even a more royal experience.  Moving forward to food and cuisine in one word it's Royal like the ambience provided by the restaurant management.  Now without any further discussion let's proceed with my royal cuisine journey. We started with Mocktails:Meetha pan & Kheera with Jeera both are amazing  and quite refreshingly real to taste , I was completely amazed with the concept of mocktails as it's quite new as per concept and taste . Starters:Paneer Tikka Multani  Soft Paneer cubes, infused with herbs and crisped in Tandoor. A perfect starter to start with. Chandani Chowk Ki Papdi Chaat If you belong from Delhi or neighbouring location or love the taste of Delhi chaats then in bet you will fall in love of this Papdi Chaat, Crisp Semolina And Flour Chips Topped with Chilled Yoghurt, Chutneys, Ginger and Spices combination of all these is quite mouth-watering and yum.  Veg Kurkuri  Another signature dish from Punjab Grill . Wontons skins filled with Minced Mushroom, Celery, Olives, Pine Nuts, Tomatoes and cheese rolled in Seviyan and deep fried. They way of presenting this cuisine is really nice also the taste as well.  Bharwaan Khumb Peshawari mushroom fad go for this starter as well , Stuffed with Paneer and spices.  Dahi Ke Kabab - Hat's off to chef and cooking team of Punjab Grill . It was Crisp, Soft and Tasty made in Curd. This is not the first time that I have taste this kabab but this is the best dahi kabab I have tasted. Stuffed with dry fruits which enrich the taste of it.  Beet The Summer with the speciality of Punjab Grill:  Motichoor Laddoo Shake  A milk shake of Vanilla ice-cream enriched with Motichoor Laddoo. Some thing new to concept I have came across.  Mock Beer  First time I had the real taste of Beer without something exciting to taste. Food:Punjab Grill Dal  Or we known as Dal Makhni cooked in mint of Mustard oil with Tomato and cream and Quite authentic to taste. Khumb Makai Tak-A-tak  Well cooked gravy of mushroom and corn in creamy gravy of onion and tomato. A perfect sabzi to try with tandoori roti.  Desserts:Litchi Ki Tehri Completely bowed over by their dessert options as I tasted the amazing and delicious dessert of Punjab Grill, and cooked in thick milk with shahi litchis in Sultans way.  Staff and Service: No words left to praise them a perfect example of wonderful service was quite professional quick Staffs were friendly, courteous and well mannered. Altogether a complete modern Lifestyle royal experience. A must recommend place for special occasions of your life with your loved ones, with an awesome royalty. The management team is working on opening new outlet in other location of Bangalore so eagerly awaiting for the same. Big Cheers!!!!  to team Punjab Grill staff's and management."

4.0,It is a good place to dine. Nice ambience. Shanthi waitress she was helping us I'm deciding things. Really nice. Second visit to Punjab grill. Good going. Beverages need more variety I think. Thanks for serving food.
4.0,"Came to this place for a Sunday lunch with my parents. It was pretty empty around 1pm. It was pretty empty and started filling up soon.  We went for ala carte. For starters we ordered Tandoori prawns, Tandoori chicken and hara bhara kebab. All the items were top notch and that mainly filled up our stomach. Had enough space for 1 main course item and a naan.  Service was ok but not the best. This an area of improvement. Prabhat served us and it was good but all the others seemed to be in a rush.  No desserts were available which seemed odd and disappointing.  All in all a 3.8 rating."
5.0,Fantastic food. Loved all the items we ordered. The service was top notch. Sunil was our steward and he was very good at his job. Bit crowded ... obviously for the good food and service. Zomato gold got me 2+2 drinks too.

3.0,"As you walk in to the ever so popular Punjab Grill you are able to see a luxury setting with an elaborate setup which is fit for a fine dining restaurant. We were immediately greeted when we entered and were shown to our table. We had been invited to review the place and we were ready for a feast as it was preceded by the cooking maestro Jiggs Kalra who used to own the restaurant chain.  Appetizers To begin our meal we started off with the Tandoori Guchchi, Tandoori Broccoli, Paneer Tikka Multani, Dahi Ke Kebab and the Bhutteyan De Kebab in the vegetarian section. In the Non  Vegetarian section we ordered the Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill and the Murgh Malai Tikka. The Paneer Tikka was very well made with succulent Paneer and flavourful spices which could be distinctly identified and worked well together.  The Bhutteyan De Kebab and the Dahi Ke Kebab were nice but the corn kebab was slightly hard but other than that it tasted good. The Broccoli unfortunately was fairly bland and lacked any real flavour or spice but it seemed like a fairly healthy option compared to the rest. The biggest disappointment according to us was the Tandoori Guchchi as we had very high expectations. Guchchi Mushrooms are rare and cooking them perfectly is a very difficult task. Unfortunately, it was fairly dry which lead to its porous body not really absorbing much of the flavour of the spices which surrounded it.  The Murgh Tikka was very good as it had the right amount of spices along with perfectly cooked Chicken. The Malai Tikka unfortunately was fairly bland as we could only taste the Malai part of the dish and nothing else.  Main Course For the main course we ordered the Kadhai Paneer and Dal Makhani for veg. In the Non  Vegetarian section we ordered the Kadhai Jheenga and the Murgh Fatehwal. These were served along with Tandoori Roti and Laccha Paratha. The Dal Makhani was very well made as it was creamy and had the flavours infused perfectly. You could immediately identify that it had been cooked for a very long time under low heat which is exactly how it should be cooked. Although we felt it could be spicier we had no issues as we loved it.  The Kadhai Paneer too was perfectly cooked as it had soft succulent Paneer with a spicy gravy which was of the perfect consistency. The only let down of the dish was that it was floating in a rather large layer of oil which seemed very unnecessary and made it seem rather greasy. The Kadhai Jheenga was very well made as we could identify that fresh Prawns had been used and they had cooked it perfectly apart from the fact that it had been seasoned very well. The addition of Pomegranate was quite interesting unlike anything we have had before.  The Murgh Fatewal unfortunately did not taste as good as the spice mix which was used just did not suit our palate as they added way too much of a certain spice which set it off balance however, the Chicken itself was cooked perfectly.  Final Verdict The command this place has when it was at its peak has probably slightly gone down from when it was owned and operated by Jiggs Kalra as it had a certain flair to it. While some of the dishes were very good, there were others which were fairly average and could most certainly be improved. This place would be perfect for a family night out as it offers a casual environment however, keep in mind that it is very highly priced and the some of the dishes have a very high premium.   Food: 3.5/5 Price: 3/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5"
5.0,The food is really tasty and worth giving a try. Plus the service by Prabhat was at par level.  The ambience is good. Little costly but overall worth it.

2.0,"Note: Vegetarians here.   We had read good reviews and heard good things about Punjab Grill and decided we'd dine here on Sunday night.The waiting time was told to be 20, but got to enter inside after 40 minutes for just 2 of us.  We opted for 1+1 Zomato gold. We first asked for a Bailey's-oreo cocktail (specials in their menu) but it wasn't available. So we settled for a cocktail which was served to us in a bulb shaped glass (forgot the name). It tasted really bland (like masala lemonade). And had to ask to make it stronger. Not sure if this is a common thing for 1+1 Zomato gold (drinks) as we have seen this behavior (diluted) in a couple more restaurants.  For starters, we ordered Tandoori Bharwan Aloo which was described as vegetables stuffed in Potatoes and cooked in Tandoor. But we were surprised to see the dish completely covered in sesame seeds. It tasted bitter and burnt. Extremely overwhelming and it spoiled the taste. It wasn't even mentioned in the menu and neither did the waiter describe when we asked if it was a good choice. We wouldn't have probably ordered as we are not big fans of seseame seeds. In mains, we ordered Amritsari Malai Kofta and Roomali roti. Kofta gravy was very rich and was the only dish that we enjoyed.Roomali Roti was way too thick and rubbery. Definitely not how it should be made. Overall wouldn't really visit again. Definitely not worth the price  PS : We were asked by the waiter multiple times to rate them on Zomato. ."
5.0,Food is good .service is excellent. Dal makni and naan was very tasty. Justin and bhuvan was also special in terms of service. Overall a very pleasant experience. I would recommend everyone to go out there at least once
4.0,"The grills are excellent, especially the mutton. The Murgh makhni was a little too sweet for my taste, but we were warned about that.  Our server Sabuj took really good care of us and made some great suggestions.  Definitely worth a visit!"
5.0,Excellent food and service. Thanks to the lady who was very polite and suggested the food portion appropriately . The ambience is just perfect and looking forward to visit again. Price is little high.
5.0,"Great food of Punjab grill , mutton biryani was mouthwatering and awesome service by Chef Negi ,Santosh Chef and Sabuj nice songs made the evening for us and especially with the drinks session .thanks Punjab grill for making our weekend"
2.0,I have seen many reviews of Punjab grill Koramangala all my friends used to say it was very good and worth the money so today I got so excited and for the newly opened outlet in malleshwaram   Im very sorry to say Im very disappointed  All the starters were cold and nothing special and for a buffet of 999rs it was of great disappointment .all the gravies was nice in buffer and the best rotis and naans I had but no white rice no biriyani I was disappointed . Very delay service of course it was crowded so we cant blame them .on the whole money spent was waste may be I should have gone for ala carte  So on the whole never going back there again
5.0,"Excellent place with awesome food. This place serves excellent grilled tandoor cuisine.  Starters: Veg- Soyabean Chop (simply superb),Hara Bhara Kabab Non Veg-Tandoori Chicken grilled  A place must try for superb grilled cuisine"

5.0,"Punjab Grill serves one of the finest Punjabi food in Bangalore, this is their 2nd outlet and the ambience is a typical fine dine experience , Chef ""Shaik Khurshid Ali"" has curated the menu and the food speaks for itself.  As soon as we entered, we were welcomed warmly and given a seat promptly, Mr Sunil was our host and he made our dine experience a memorable one (I would recommend ask for that guy when you drop in).  We started with some Shorba,  Murgh Badami Shorba: This is Punjabi style Shorba, mildly spiced and served with crunches of almond and minced Murgh chunks, the taste was delicious and every sip had a rich flavour of almond and just the right amount of murgh pieces, the combination was unique, I highly recommend this dish.  For the Starters we had some Non-Vegetarian Grills,  Bhatti Da Murgh: This is juicy chicken Leg pieces, Marinated in exotic spicy yoghurt and Mugga, completed to a crisp finish on the Bhatti. The exotic marination was to die for, super tasty and the chicken was very fresh and tender, the portion size is quite huge and easily serves 3-4ppl. Highly recommend this dish.  Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill: Chicken chunks seeped in a blend of cumin, fresh cream, Cheddar cheese and garlic before lightly being roasted in tandoor. The chicken was fresh and tender with tasty marination, tasted best with the pudina chutney that came as a companion,  loved each pieces and left me asking for more.   Ghee Roash Mutton Boti: This was slightly a disappointment, the Mutton pieces were too dry and coated with very less Ghee roast masala, the masala missed the strong ghee essence, this dish needs an improvement.  For the Main Course,   Murgh Lababdar Curry: The taste was BANG ON!  A tomato based gravy with tender Murgh pieces, the gravy was lip smacking, superb creation by the chef, one of the best I have had soo far, tasted best with Butter kulcha. I highly recommend this gravy, not to be missed.  The food in this restaurant is slightly priced on a higher side, but the quality and quantity is matched up to it, the staff were highly skilled and generously recommended dishes. Mr Sunil made our evening a delightful experience and kudos to the team at Punjab Gill.  Taste 4.5/5 Service 5/5 Pricing 4/5 Quality 5/5 Quantity 5/5 Cleanliness 5/5 Plating 4/5  Would I recommend this Restaurant?  Yes! A quintessential Punjabi food in town! A must try place."
4.0,They have a great salad bar. Can really cook Paneer - soft and succulent. Should improve on her spice factor on their non veg dishes. Special praise for Sabuj who took care of us during the lunch hours and ensured we enjoyed our experience.
4.0,"Makes it crowded as located in a mall, suggested to book a table and go. Very similar to their other outlet.High on the pricing!!! Even felt  the quantity to be less compared to pricing . Liked their signature drink offered after the food;)"

5.0,service excellent staff very polite Ms shanthi was incharge of taking the food orders and she did her job very politely and punctually taste is good may be the cost needs to be reviewed!
5.0,I had been seeing this place since the time I shifted to bangalore.I used to see it every day on my way to work back then .bt  never really got the chance to visit .as I shifted another locality .Finally been Punjab grill Orion mall this is first time..seafood platter. Murgh ki chaampeion .MURGH  tikka pg FOOD . was excellent.

5.0,Excellent food and Ambiance with great service by Bhuwan and Sabuj! The malai Kofta and Biryani are a treat for the taste buds. The pan shots are a good end to a fantastic dinner.
2.0,"Was received by the only saving grace of the evening, Chef Ali, great guy was trying to manage the reservation and having quick conversations with different guests. Loved the warmth and hospitality, but this I assumed would be consistent, table of 5, you gave us a table next to the bar where the staff movement was a lot and they kept edging the table and apologising, you say bottle of water we assume it will be Himalayan or aquafina or something like that, the waiter picks up a bottle of veen and starts pouring before we say anything, being regulars at koramangla we knew what we wanted to eat but he insisted on us trying the lobster, we were entertaining someone so had to subtly tell him that we know what we want and just give us time to sort of plan our order. All that is still OK but what rather was disappointing apart from being too pushy is that your quality of food is not like what it used to be or should be considering your price points, the biryani has to be looked into, your gravies were to die for something definetly off with the consistency. Instead of asking if everything was ok on our table, the staff attending came and told us do mention a good review on Zomato. Since you asked me this is what I had to share post my experience, to sum it up poor experience with regards to staff and perhaps some sole searching and get back the consistency like before , may be the manager will not have to include the pls give us you feedback on Zomato line !!! Get the Mojo back Punjab Grill !! You are much better than last night !"
5.0,Really really good food. Definitely a must try. Nice ambience. Neeraj and Bhuvan helped us choose a really great menu. It was lit . The mattha is really good
5.0,Lovely place for awesome food.. Sabuj thanks for the hospitality. Definitely recommend for outing for friends.. Good Punjabi food and tasty deserts

4.0,Thank you suboj.. for being a good staff the food the ambience all were lovely...this place will be recommended especially in orion...have fun
3.0,"Malai Tikka was a reheated one and not at all up to the Koramangala standards. chef came and apologize and made another batch but was just a little better. chicken biyirani was good , naan was decent . service was good but then since the food was not up to Punjab Grill standards could not give higher rating"
5.0,This place is Very nice place. It offers Good food. The staff is polite and very friendly. They serve food with a smile. Saboj has been very friendly!
5.0,"This is the place if you want to enjoy Punjabi non veg cuisine. Delicious, rich, awesome.... One must try the Dal Makhani, Rara Mutton and paratha. Chef Khurshid Ali - super taste in your hands. Must Visit. Good service and all staff is friendly."
4.0,"If you want a fine dining experience with authentic Punjabi food, head to Punjab Grill!  Nice ambience and rich yummy food.  We ordered dahi ke kebab for starters, it was yum! For mains, we had Paneer Lababdar, Dal makhani and Lahsuni naan. The Paneer gravy and Dal were rich, creamy and absolutely delightful.   Must try : Dahi ke kebab, Paneer Lababdar and Lahsuni naan.  The complimentary paan shots at the end of the meal is very refreshing. A nice and unique concept.  Loved the quick and prompt service, the staff were very attentive to our needs.   Food : 4/5 Ambience : 4/5 Service : 5/5   The prices are steep, but the portion sizes and food make up for it. Definitely worth a visit."
4.0,"Punjab Grill has great ambience and setting, nestled in the comfy corner of Orion mall next to PVR GOLD Class entrance. The best thing about the place is the extremely friendly staff - hats off to the person who gives them a pep talk every day to serve each customer with a warm and welcoming smile.. Right from the front desk to the waiting staff, everyone is extremely nice. Thanks to Sabuj for making the evening a memorable one with the courteous service.  I ain't no food critic but I do believe that great customer service is paramount and this place excels in it.  As for the food, try out the non-veg platter and experience the tender meat just melt in your mouth. The other dishes we tried were Ok-ish. Will look forward to another visit to try out some more stuff."
2.0,"Went for lunch today at aprox 3.30pm. It was a first visit to the outlet. Decided to go for buffet. The food taste was good but all the food were cold, adding on that the buffet was almost empty, had to ask 2 to 3 times if it is going to be refilled again. Also the variety was very limited & Charging 900 with empty buffet is too much. But the service was good with Sobuj, he kept asking is we require anything. Humble request to the managers not to suggest guests for buffet if it is time to close the buffet."
5.0,Very good food and service . This is our third time that our family is enjoying . Saboj was very nice in serving us .   We love to come back again and also we are happy to have Punjab Grill next to our home .
4.0,"Great food....authentic North Indian food in Bangalore. soya chap was really amazing, perfectly marinated and grilled. Sabuj and Munan, thanks for the great service guys."
5.0,The food was great and the service provided was awesome..great service done by Mr.Sabuj. Great place to have dinner in Orion mall. Had a pleasant dinner
3.5,Punjab grill is tucked inside Orion mall right next to the food court. It seemed pretty busy for a weekday lunch but we managed to get a place. We chose to have the north indian buffet and the spread within the buffet was decent. The Amritsari lassi is not very great and the dessert options can be increased in the buffet. Service is good with a decent ambiance.  Verdict - Can try!
5.0,Awesome food with staff friendly who are extrenly ..the food was good service was Excelent server name Sab....the portion sizes really good     good food  good. Staff good ambience good music
5.0,"indian here. We tried out various starters like paneer tikka, dahi kebab, which was amazing. In the main course we went for dal tadka and bhindi which was equally good.  The ambience is very good with beautiful music in the background.  Very friendly and courteous staff, especially Sabuj and bhuvan.  Recommended visit."
1.0,"Restaurant manager #refused to let me inside the restaurant because I am a #wheelchair user.   I came here with my family to enjoy a nice dinner. It was extremely disappointing to interact with the staff.  Ever since they started their restaurant in Orion mall I have been asking them to keep a temporary ramp at least. But my request has fallen on deaf years and I always get useless reassurances from them.  All other restaurants have spoiled me bad with their #Hospitality and #SpecialTreatment whether they are accessible or not. Many come in the latter category, but they still go out of their way to accommodate and make arrangements."
1.0,Denying entry to anyone who is wheel chair bound  is not cool. Its pathetic.  Shame on Punjab Grill. U can serve good food but you also need a more humane approach..
1.0,They have refused entry to my colleague who is on a wheelchair. Saddened by the attitude and hope the management takes note of this and takes a humane and inclusive approach going forward.
5.0,"Had an excellent experience ! The afternoon buffet was nice with nice variety and excellent taste ! Loved butter chicken , Karahi paneer and appetisers! Mr Sabuj served us with smile and was very helpful"
5.0,Authentic tasting food and the mouthwatering galouti kebab... like the cherry on top of the pie courteous and friendly service... thankyou mr.sabuj (who served us) for serving food with a smile... great ambience too...

5.0,The most amazing place to be and the food is just amazzzzing.. And the ambience is totally up to the mark with those melodious music the kind of food and the taste( yummy in my tummy) hospitality wise totally PERFECT. Dal makhni and paneer lawabdaar is a must for dessert KULFI
5.0,Wonderful dining experience and courteous staff. Food is exquisite and the music played matches with the theme of the place. We were happy and satisfied. Good service and assistance by staff Mr. Avnikant. Dining is always a combo experience of courteous staff and good food. This place has it both.
5.0,Good food and ambience. Swear by their soya chaap masala and amazing music. Very hospitable staff and good service by mr. Sunil.  Would prefer this place though its a tab bit expensive.
5.0,Where can you find some seriously great food in a great restaurant but at pocket-friendly rates? Punjab Grill is the answer! Great ambience coupled with amazingly tasty Punjabi food. Was served by Mr. Avnikant and Bhuwan! The staff are great too! Must go place!
5.0,One of the best place for Punjabi food in Bangalore. Try Malai Kofta.  Also Keema Kulcha. We were served by Sunil who was very polite and friendly.
4.0,"Punjab grill, a new North Indian restaurant which has developed in Orion mall, is a warm place for both north and south Indian foodies, especially after a hectic shopping or movie show in the weekend. First thing first, you will definitely get royal vibes of undivided Punjab right from the moment of entering this sparkling restaurant owing to the well-thought-out presentation and the excellent service. There is a bar positioned right infront of the entrance but it happened to be empty on that day. There was a Ramnabami buffet running temporarily but we were not very interested in a vegetarian buffet as per the price they are charging. After we had placed the orders, a green chutney (as kabab dip), freshly sliced onions and roasted papads were served immediately. The ""murg badami shorba"" which was the only appetizer we had taken was too humble in quantity but its soothing zest delivered a great beginning for the royal dinner. The grilled items reached our table within 5 minutes and the plating was as good as the flavour. The prices are largely on the higher side but the kababs were very filling with that perfect authenticity of Punjabi cuisine which we uaually crave for (don't over-order foods as the apparent quantity is misleading!). The main course food had to be very light since we were almost done with our dinner but in the excitement of getting a smack of their nalli ghost and plain nun we had placed the order. Each nun had three large-sized fragments. The mutton dish was cooked in mughlai style keeping in mind the health conscious customers as well and thus it came up to give a blend of tangy-cum-benign after-taste. Unfortunately the firni was not very appealing. The conplimentary paan shot provided as mouth- freshener at the end of the meal was unique and refreshing ! Since we had a corporate discount of 10%, the cost per person amounted to be approximately 1000 per person. Recommend dishes : Dahi ke kabab, Ajwaini fish kabab, Shorba Value for money : 3.5/5"
4.5,We had been there last night i.e. 16.3.18. Very tasty food and service. One Mr. Sunil's service was exceptionally good. We will visit frequently.
4.0,"I had heard about this restaurant from acquaintances and hence decided to explore their food. I went there with my friend.While we were contemplating if we had to take the buffet or the a la carte, we finally decided the a la carte choice and it turned out to be perfect for both of us.  We ordered for a Sheek kabab, ( hope the spelling is right :) ) and vegetable biryani. Trust me it was so fulling but mouth watering.  As we were sitting, waiting for our food, we were given papad and mint chutney. The mint chutney was out of the world.  A must to mention, very courteous staff. The veg biryani on the menu had kesar as an ingredient, and I was sure it was going to be on the sweeter side. So I had requested them to make the Biryani spicier to which they obliged.  The most surprise element was their pan shake at the end of the meal. It was mouth watering. Overall had a great experience.  Love the ambience, simple and neat as well.  I would highly recommend this place for the experience!"
5.0,I went with my friend and starting from welcoming as pleasant. The food was awesome and something different I fount is dessert. Sabuj service was great and always smiling and explaining very calmly. Over all experiences was great. Surely come again.
3.0,not so spacious. seems in a small space they have added more tables . food were good bt not superb or yummie..doesn't feel like luxury dinning... staff were responsive and friendly. not much delay in serving food
4.5,Food and service is good here. A must visit place for foodies. Each dish served carries a unique taste and essence which separates it from other restaurants.
2.0,Food is average . No great starters . Not up to the expectations as Punjab grill is in New Delhi . Dessert is a turn down . Phirni tasted like mild salted kheer n jalebis we served cold .
4.0,We visited this place on a weekend. They had both the buffet and alacarte. We choose to go for alacarte. The dishes we ordered were excellent. Their associate Ms. Shanti was extremely courteous and friendly. She in fact suggested the quantity to be ordered as their portion size is big. Well we liked the food and the ambiance. Service was good. Will definitely recommend this place.
5.0,"Food was good in terms of portion size and taste, but the service was excellent specially our amazing host - Sabuj. His service personalised and very hospitable.  Best restaurant in Orion mall. THANKS."
2.0,"Visited today for lunch. Below average service and food. Staff here is ignorant and treats you as if the food is free, slow service. Everything was needed to be asked for, right from water to clearing the plates. The restaurant manager is on rounds has no courtesy to greet the customers and take care of the service. Food was just okay, nothing great. The buffet service was cramped and no fast filling of items and replacement of crockery. Not value for money and expected quality from a household like Jiggs Kalra."
5.0,Great food. Both Veg and Chicken Options were good. Music Ambience was wonderful. Great service. Good job Sunil in taking order. Great service from Subuj and Avnikant.
4.0,"Visited Punjab Grill to celebrate special occasion with family and it was a good evening spent with some delicious food. A typical punjabi restaurant in fine dining catagory. Being saturday, it was quite crowded but thanks to Sunil who made our evening quite memorable by his very special smile and quite efficient service . We ordered two chicken starters I.e. chicken tikka punjab grill and bhatti da murg and both were different in taste. My personal opinion is that murg tikka should have smaller pieces to allow better penitration of marination and also smaller bird taste better. In main course ordered paneer lababdar which was the highlight of the evening. Being a hardcore non vegetarian, never expected that in a punjabi restaurant I'll find a vegetarian dish which is worth trying again and again. Butter nan was too good...Overall it was a wonderful experience and again a special mention for Sunil who served us with a very special touch which made our evening special. Ratings Ambiance 3.5/5 Food - 4/5 Service -4.5/5 Caution : Serving portion is quite large so order carefully."
4.0,service is good and Mr.Avnikant  was very good at his service. Guchchi pulao is a must try. Ambience is nice too. Need more vegetarian starter.
3.5,One of the many over rated buffets in Bangalore. Except for the taste and service nothing else is great. No great varieties. In fact limited choices. 795+tax is definitely over priced for any buffet.
4.0,Starters  were great. The tandoori chicken was really tender and succulent. Quantity is fair as well. Worth the money. Servers are extremely polite and attentive . Special mention for our server Mr. Avanikant who made sure we had a great experience.
4.5,"Food is good and hotel too....... Service is nice.  For us Mr. Bhuvan served food, polite and professional.  Had tomato shorbha, kadai panner and naan, Its all good."
5.0,Enjoyed  a sumptuous  meal...food was very  delicious  and the service rendered by Sabuj was excellent. We ordered chicken tikka masala with roti and laccha paratha prepared by chef negi . It was simply awesome . I recommend to visit this place atleast once

1.0,"We love the food at Punjab grill thats located in Koramangala, we only visited as its closer to our residence. We were totally disappointed by the food that was served, the menu is totally different compared to the one in Koramangala. The food wasnt up to the mark.. the waiter wasnt well trained. Totally disappointed by this Punjab grill, I would recommend to go to Koramangala Punjab grill."

1.0,Food is sub-standard. The roti's were hard. They disregarded our allergic restrictions. Spilt our drinks and did not bother apologizing or even replacing our drinks. Instead they left us to savor what was left of it. Curries had undercooked vegetables.
4.5,Delicious food. Bhatti da kabab was absolute delight. Excellent service by Sabuj and Niraj - they were very cordial. Pan shot at the end was an absolute delight.
4.5,The mango lassi Niraj and Sabuj made was fantastic! I will always eat at this place when I visit Bangalore. Excellent food and ambience. Buffet style.
1.0,"Worst place ever that you can visit... Price you pay is just for the smile of the waiters... And they charge you an extra service charge of 10% without u noticing in the bill... The taste is horrible by the way... If you have so much money and want to waste some, this is the right place.."
5.0,Food was excellent and service was also excellent by Subuj would love to visit the place with family and friends great atmosphere and ambience nice soft music
1.0,"Worst ever service i have ever seen in my entire life,worstest service and the money i got charged for my lunch is not at all worth it they are just worst at their managing,worst worst and worst don't even think of this hotel,instead eat any where and whatever u like in other places except PG."

5.0,Food was awesome... N service was too gud... Sabuj served us really NYC... Was worth the money... Really happy.... Must go.... Ambience was also gud
5.0,"Just awesome. The superlative sums up the culinary experience that your taste buds go through when you visit this place. Innovative in serving and presentation, the food does not lack any of the complexity that the chef aspired to put on your plate. The spring rolls served in dipping sauce is a stand out as is the sarsoon da saag and the roti. Probably one of the few restaurants where I would not revert to old favourites on the me u as I feel everything would be a new experience."
4.0,"The place is quaint, the menu excellent, the waiting staff are very pleasant and we did notice that in the one hour of being there, all tables got equal warm, friendly, with a smile service and hospitality.   We had Tamatar ka Shorba which was total delight to the palate  The Appetisers - The Tandoori Broccoli and Bhawaan Khumb Peshawari were perfectly chargrilled, medium spiced and total must-haves.  The Soya Chaamp Masala was extremely good and with the absolute right blends of ingredients What we found mediocre was the Khasta Roti and surely not the right combination for the curry To end this with the Masala Chaas was icing on the cake. Thank you Team Punjab Grill"
3.5,"Food:3/5 Service :4.5/5 Ambience 4.5/5 This is a new restaurant that has opened up in Orion . Went here with my friends. We tried the lobster , presentation was really good. The paneer was good. The pista lassi was very bitter and I personally didn't like it. The Currys were very average . The mango milkshake was good . Make reservation before you go here as the place is very small."
5.0,"This outlet is just amazing is the word be it the food or the services.The warmth , the welcome and the ambiance is awesome. The hospitality of Neeraj is just out of the world he makes you feel so special and importamt with his nature beautiful smile and the warmth. Neeraj is one person makes this place so special for me and shall visit again and again . It will not be out of way to mention about the chief Chef , he is one smiling guy moves around and looks after at all tables really makes u feel every special with his caring approach towards all the guest . For me I shall visit this outlet only because of these two lovely people . They both haven't got the word NO with them ! The Food is just awesome together makes this restaurant a place must visit with family and look for these two guys and see how they make your day . Must try Raan and bhatti murgh mouth watering and sign off with the Kheer and jalebi with rabri . A great place for everyone . Thank you Neeraj and the Chef !"
1.5,"Not a value for money experience. I will not pay this price for ambience, taste or service. It is definitely over rated.   The starter we ordered was tasteless and was served without any chutneys, when requested for the same the chutney provided was equally bland.   It was too crowded for fine dine restaurant."
5.0,Very ambient for a family service was excellent and food was fantastic. Service by one Mr Sabuj was very warm treats everyone with a smile and suggest the right sort of menu based on our choices
5.0,"It was my mothers birthday and we went bowling, as the game prolonged for too long we thought were going to go home empty stomach but Punjab grill was such a saviour. We went at 11 PM but the waiters were so sweet and kept a smiling face throughout. A big thumbs up to two waiters Sabuj and Niraj they were really nice and Also gave us free dessert! For appetisers wed ordered Mutton yakhni shorba and tamatar shorba which was great start to the wonderful meal we had ahead. For starters wed ordered the non -veg platter. It consisted of 1 fish starter, 2 chicken and one mutton starter. They were all juicy and delicious. For mains we ordered murgh roast fathewala with butter garlic naan and plain naam. The curry was very flavoursome and the chicken pieces were nice and juicy. We also ordered chicken dum biryani which was really masaledaar but the raita cut down the spices perfectly. We then asked them for the bill but they offered to give us dessert on the house. The dessert they gave us was firni, it was a very subtle and delicious dessert made of rice flavoured with saffron.  We completed the meal with paan shots which they offered complimentary too. The experience we had here was amazing and Id recommend everyone to try it out. A big thumbs up to your team!"
5.0,Sabuj was extremely polite and fast in service. Food quality was mind blowing. We enjoyed our 2nd outing in this place and will surely come again.
4.0,It's a pretty good restaurant and good food and service. Chef narendra and Mr neeraj made it memorable dinner. But the service could've been better.
4.5,We went for the express Punjab grill inside the food court . The food was by far the best punjabi food we have had in Bangalore . We ordered for two combos dal makhani combo and the Amritsari kulcha combo along with chaap . The food had authentic punjabi taste and the portion size was also quite good .
4.5,We had great service and Sabuj helped us order the right quantity. he was extremely pleasant. It is a great place for Punjabi food. if you go there ask for Sabuj
5.0,"Served by Sabuj, excellent food and service. We ordered the seekh kebabs and rumali roti as main course, and the seafood platter as accompiment.  They also served ""paan shots"" after the meal as a palate cleanser and those were a delightful touch."
5.0,"The food is 4/5. I'm giving a 5 because of the staff. We came in at closing time and the staff were very patient, polite and friendly, especially Mr. Niraj & Sabuj"
4.0,"Visited this place for lunch on a weekday! We opted for the buffet. They have a really good stretch! The starters are ok to taste and they were cold! The fish starter was really bad and smelly. Coming to the main course, all the curries were good and served hot. Another sad part of the buffet was that they only served veg biryani! I really liked their dal makhani.. also their staff is really really good and so quick. I got a very good service from Mr. Sabuj. Thank you! Ill surely visit again for their service !"
4.0,I loved the preparation. Rarely any restaurant is able to serve delicious vegetarian dishes. Veg shami kabab was delicious.  Even the chicken sikh kabab roll was yummy. Overall 4 out of 5 . The service was nice
4.5,"Went for dinner before a late night movie , service is efficient.The food tastes great. Was shocked to see the place almost full on a Monday night so definitely book a table in advance. We dint order much as we had to catch a movie but food was great , oh I already mentioned that !  Meal ended with a yummy Paan shot. Ambience is alright, the tables are very close to each other and its a small space so might feel congested."
1.0,"Nothing Punjabi about it . The portions are a mess.. a butter chicken will have 4 small pieces of chicken in it , first time Punjabi food being served in such tiny portions . The Naan will be massive but under cooked . The food flavour is just boring . If you put a price on something also add the effect and luxury to the food . So many better places in Bangalore for Punjabi food and this is not one ."
4.5,Extremely good service by Sabuj and Niraj and their colleagues. Non veg Appetizers are very good. The zaffrani naan is also superb! We ate a lot and enjoyed it all. Orion Mall outlet.
5.0,Excellent food and excellent service by Mr. Niraj and team especially Bhuvan. He took care of all our needs and always greeted us with a smile and met all our and would love to come back again .
4.5,Food is awesome. Mr.Avinikanth is much friendlier and knows what to offer and serves food on time. Well mannered and good ambience. Well done Avinikanth.
3.5,"Place and ambiance -   Place and ambiance, I would say is average. Although the interiors are nicely done up, the place gives a very cluttered up feel. There was some kind of noise and rush in the place.   Food -   We ordered for hara Bhara kebab, roti, butter naan and makai Palak bhurj. The food tastes really good. Quality of the food and the portions served was good enough. We especially enjoyed makai Palak bhurj.   Service and pricing -   The service can be vastly improved. Just a couple of them exhibit warmth in their service. There is no uniformity in their service. While a bunch of wet tissues were given to a set of people to clean their hands before food, some of us werent provided with the same.   However, there were kind enough to make extra soft rotis for my little one on request.   This is definitely a pricey place. But the quantity of the food served was quite generous I would say."
5.0,"The food and ambience are both amazing. The staff are helpful and friendly. I very much liked Chicken Malai Tikka, Salmon Tikka and Mutton Champein. They offered free welcome drink which was highly refreshing. The Mutton Dum Biryani, Amritsari Keema Kulcha and Mutton Punjab Grill curry were very tasty. Lastly dont miss the Paan Shot which they give free at the end. All food were awesome. Specially their staff Mr. Sabuj and Mr. Neeraj were very friendly and highly courteous. I strongly recommend this restaurant."
1.0,Excellent food and good service by Sabuj who served us. Ambiance is also very good. Excellent staff . Very delicious North Indian food with latest varieties of food items.
4.5,"Excellent lunch buffet, served well by Sabuj. Comfortable ambiance and relaxing music. Quick and delectable Punjabi food. Hope the quality is maintained"
5.0,Ausome food and taste. Good service. Lots of variety. Ambience is creative and sets of the mood.  Food quality is nice. You can come with ur friends    Sabuj waiter was very supportive
5.0,"Walked in to Punjab grill, Orion mall today. Had a wonderful experience. Loved the hospitality as much as the food.   The Amritsari Kulcha and Biryani are must haves. So are the Aam Panna and Shikanji.   The food had taste and flavour whilst not being spicy or robust.   Will definitely come here again."
1.0,"We had went for weekend buffet lunch, menu was very less Main course-2 vegetarian dishes, 2 non vegetarian, starter-2 paneer varieties 1 chicken kabab and fish fingers, NO WELCOME DRINK   they charge 10% service charge for buffet too  We were 5 paid 4500 including all taxes  No welcome drink was provided  Restaurant doesnt have hand wash and restroom, FINGER BOWL is the only option   NOT AT ALL WORTH THE MONEY YOU PAY"
5.0,"Good service, delicious food. Striking feature was the executive chef, Ali, in the midst of the restaurant assisting in seating of the customers and co-ordinating operations beautifully. I was a bit concerned but once the food was served I realized that it's only coz the kitchen was in order, could the executive chef take on the extra mantle. The pan shots at the end of the meal was a nice touch. Am coming to visit you guys soon."
3.0,"Punjab Grill @Orion Mall.Dainty interiors, cutlery and overwhelming staff.The starters were superb but the main wasn't upto the mark.  On my table-Paneer Satte,Tandoori Says Chaap,Malai Kofta,Chicken Makhni and tandoori Rotis. 3043 inclusive of taxes and C.S"
1.0,"Don't go by name... In their entire menu they don't have Punjab or grill speciality.... and I am talking about the buffet which costs 795 + 10% service tax+5% Gst. in this price you can experience a mammoth buffet menu @chutney Chang or Barbecue nation. Ambiance: Ambiance of this place is nice but if you are going for a buffet then this place will give you inferiority complex coz the buffet counter is very small and almost equal to a chat counter of any other buffet restaurant. Food: Only 3 starters and 2 options for main course. As I told you nothing Punjabi here coz they don't have kulcha, sarso da Sarag, Makkke Di roti, lassi in their menu. Starters were not hot and there was only one grill item. They horrible part was the dessert section, Rosogulla (Bengali dish) and phirni. They don't have ice cream, can you imagine. So please avoid. Service: We asked for table service of starters which was denied by the staff but they served the next table, I don't know why they denied us. The manager was good and brought hot starters when we complain about the cold ones."
5.0,Punjab Grill is a very very nice place with good food and lovely ambience... very apt to spend quality time with family to eat out. Thanks to Sabuj for being courteous with us.
1.0,"I had visited the Punjab Grill at Koramangala when it was still run by Jiggs Kalra and my, what an experience that was!  However this outlet of Punjab Grill (and sans Jiggs Kalra) was very, very disappointing. First of all, the space is so cramped, there was no effort put in the decor of the place, the furniture was old and being reused, the music was blah and loud and the chairs, tables and the cutlery were dirty. As for the food, the kababs werent well marinated, the shorba tasted like salty water (where did the promised flavours go?) and the biryani was a total disappointment. The service was slow and they got their legendary Paan shots wrong as well. Id not suggest this place at all.   Go to the food court while at Orion-even thatd trump Punjab Grill."
5.0,This is one of the best restaurants in Bangalore so far....... We have come here many times....... Mr Sabuj and Ms Shanthi were wonderful.....the food is great and the service is exceptional...... I highly recommend people to have food here
5.0,The food was very nice.   Special mention for the grills and biriyani.  The staff were very nice.  Especial mention for Sabuj for excellent service..
5.0,Sabuj and Neeraj are very good in service. Sepecially the paan shot was excellent. Both of them are well behaved and cultured. Food quality is also best.
5.0,"Very good steward - Sabuj.  Awesome recommendation on starter, main course and a very charming attitude.   Will definitely come back again for lunch/dinner"
5.0,"I really loved the place and their service in particular. We entered the restaurant just about when the buffet was about to close. As we really wanted to have buffet, the staff ensured that we get everything served nice and hot. Most of the items were freshly prepared for us and served to us. The food quality and taste was also amazing. Special Thanks to Sabuj and Neeraj for their amazing service."
2.5,"A place riding on the brand name of legendary chef Jiggs Kalra but sadly fails to impress. We started of with the veg platter and hara bhara kebab. The only dish worth mentioning is the tandoori broccoli. The other dishes were something I wouldn't expect from a place like this.   For the mains we ordered a couple of Rotis, naans, stuffed kulchas along with paneer lababdar and sabziyon ki milayan (mix veg) along with some black dal. Nothing out of the ordinary and just plain average.   We ordered the phirni for desserts, again too runny and just sweet nothing else. The much talked about pan shot was just about alright.   The service was very professional but it couldn't make up for what was lacking in the food. The place has prime location, great ambiance but the selling point that is the food isn't hitting the bulls eye by a long shot especially for the prices they charge. A disappointing experience from a much anticipated place."
5.0,Good service and excellent food  And better ambienece with good staff and staff hospitality (sabuj)was good  Will definitely visit again  Overall good
5.0,Awesome place and the best staff experience I've ever had..  Sabuj and neeraj were so polite and hospitable that i felt at home...  I'd recommend this place if anyone wants to go to have good food and Great staff and lovely experience.

5.0,Neeraj Im happy with ur services and food taste was really delicious and it was freshly prepared instantly .Both chicken biryani and kabab it was really nice
4.5,From the time we arrived was attended to immediately and given an estimated time of halt hour and was promptly seated  the atmosphere was lively with families and light background music    The buffet had an variety of dishes and tasted well Well the service wow just great we were attend to by sabu and shanti thank you to all unable to get the managers name at the entrance and in the restaurant but well organized and the team was just amazing  A small suggestion to make it even better  Inform about the buffet availability in entrance Have at hand some desserts available in case of guests who are diabetic   Over all a pleasant experience
3.5,"Ambience is good and so is the food. Taste is very nice and all starters and food are absolutely fresh. Then why did I get a 3.5? Service can be better. When we were done with starters no one cleared the table u till we called them. Second, pricing of the buffet was same for Veg and Non-Veg. Surprising. Can be differentiated."
5.0,"Amazing food. Amazing place. Amazing service. Absolutely loved my time there. Would like to keep going there again and again. I had my curries and starters' veganised for me, and they were great!"
5.0,"Awesome food ..highly recommend this place for authentic Punjabi & Mughlai food   We tried Raarhya meat & Amritsari Malai Kofta, with Tandoori Roti & Rumali Roti. Awesome service by Neeraj & Bhuvan. Must try place."
1.0,"Food is way below expectations and nothing compared to the Delhi outlet. Chewy ghee roasted mutton,salty murgh makhani and tasteless gulabjamuns were highlights. Every single dish we ordered failed to deliver. The prices however are fine dining. Smaller Punjabi restaurants are a better bet anyday."
4.5,Excellent service by Sabuj!! Exquisite taste!! I would recommend everyone to come and taste the non-veg curries. Great experience and food..

1.0,"The service was very bad. I ordered 2 biriyanis and within 3 mins I said I just want only one biriyani, before the order came. But they refused to cancel the order and made me pay for the bill and forced me to pack it. Even spoke to the manger(Binod) who refused to take it back.   Damn man its just a change of mind within a few mins. Happens to everyone especially when you are out with Friends.   Thanks Binod, we are not coming back."
4.0,Courteous staff. Authentic Punjabi dishes are yummy. The pan shot they serve is very delicious. Feels like you are drinking pan. Sabuj's service was outstanding!
4.5,Great and exotic food. The panner used in curries is really awesome.  And the way the food is cooked and presented is quite refined.  The place has nice ambience and the staff is courteous and always helpful.
4.0,Had some amazing north Indian food after a long time. Definitely the food was delicious.But it's a little pricey. Nothing great about the ambience though. service was great. They were warm and welcoming !  My special thanks to Mr.Neeraj for being super kind and took care of every little thing. Had a great. Definitely worth the visit. :D
5.0,"Great food and great ambience.  Great service by sabuj and neeraj. Highly recommended for good north Indian food. Amazing, well cooked and well marinated starters."
1.5,Unfortunately had a bad experience today at Punjabi Grill at Orion mall. The tomato soup was over spicy burnt our throat. It did not have taste except for the loaded spice. We had ordered veg curry which was horrible due to lack of salt and under cooked or rather not cooked beans and carrot. It felt totally tasteless with the roti. Savior was the daal tadka and paneer Tikka multani. We also informed the manager about this but he just didn't seem to care. Overall poor quality for the price the charge. Just did not live up to the expectation and will not recommend for others too. Utterly disappointing!!
5.0,"An amazing service and food keep it up!!!Sabuj an amazing helper with a really heart warming service, really happy also would tell about this restraint to everyone....."
5.0,"Sabuj- Awesome service nice food, must visiting place, wonderful to be around this place.  Punjab Grill u guys rock, looking forward to meet you guys again."

5.0,Savour the authentic taste of delectable north-west frontier cuisine served in a platter with royal generosity.  Punjab Grill. The opening of the second outlet of Punjab Grill recently at Malleshwaram has certainly bought cheers to the lovers of the north-indian cuisine in the vicinity.I have been a big fan of this brand ever since it set its foot in the Bangalore over half a decade ago.                                                                 ...Read full post on thefoodietales.com

5.0,"Sabuj and Bhuvan  Excellent food, starters and main course was really good, amazing ambiance, very very courteous top class staff. A must visit."
5.0,"Punjab Grill was on my bookmark for the longest time and finally got to visit the place on my friend's strong recommendation last night and I loved every part of my visit from the start till the end. For the starters - the staff is super welcoming, for the main course of the entire visit - the hospitality is at the peak that I have experienced compared to the most superior starred hotels too and for the dessert - the taste, presentation and the service of the food is soo amazing that it just made every bite and every spoon so tasty.  Apart from all the pampering that I had for the night (I call it pampering because off late we hardly experience such good hospitality at all). So actually for the starters, we had this Chakunder ki Tikki which wasnt like any other ordinary veg kebabs but it was so different and do not seem bored with the beetroot colour at all because the outer crunch and this small lump of cheese inside just melts in your mouth along with the mint chutney. For the main course,we had the Veg Dum ki Biryani which was packed with the right Dum and served hotttt and the rice so moist n soft which proves that its so freshly made. And  with the sweetest gesture, we had this paan shots at the end of it all that was served as surprise compliment. This gentleman named Neeraj who was serving us most of the time and the entire staff of Punjab Grill at this location were such an amazing team that made our meal memorable for a lifetime. And even if I seem like Im exaggerating, this place is a must visit to get a simple yet the best hospitable restaurant service. I loved the place, service, calm music for a peaceful dinner so much that I am already going back again tonight with my folks ;)"
5.0,Food is just delicious..would recommend the place..!! Excellent service by the staff..would specially like to name Sabuj. Will visit the place again..!!
3.5,"Was eagerly waiting for it to open.. finally visited...  Ambiance- damm boring n sad actually.. it wasnt fun at all .. no decor no lights no colours.. in short.. disappointing .. tables are placed very closed so its kinda intruding others privacy..  Service- very good, the servers were nice polite and kitchen to table time was also decent.  Food- beetroot tikki was below average, soya chap was good even tomato shorba was decent( bread crumbs could have been better) paneer lababdar was tasty with smokiness flavours and dal makhani was tasty too.. amritsari kulcha was too big n heavy but tasty. Main course portions are small in terms of price u pay..  Desserts- 3 flavours gulab jamun n all tasted decent.  Overall a nice place.. would have rated perfect but the ambiance is depressing n bad that i cant give full marks.  Will visit again- for food yes"
5.0,Very good food and drinks. Wonderful service from Neeraj at the restaurant. Will recommend to friends and will definitely come again. Hope the quality is maintained
5.0,"Brilliant food coupled with great service, courtesy Sabuj. Will definitely visit again soon. A great place for a date with your mate. Thanks for an amazing time Prajna:)"
2.0,"Ambience : 3.5 Service : 0.5 Food : 1  We went to this place yesterday on Christmas for dinner. I had been to the the kormanagala place couple of time and loved everything about it so i convinced my friends to try it at Orion. We were 5 people and we reached there at 9:15 PM , were informed about 45 minutes waiting time and we decided to wait. Since we wanted to try all the variety here, we opted for buffet. Our turn came at 9:55 and there the torture started.  Service : Pathetic is the word. After initial welcome we were literally left on our own. There were no spoons, napkins or glasses on the table till we got starters and started having it. There was no one to guide us on what will be served on table and what needs to be taken from the counters. We literally had to get up and go find a waiter/waitress for us every time we needed anything. We could notice that the waiters/waitresses were quite attentive to people opting Ala Carte (table right beside us were being treated so well). Only when we complained, someone was asked to just stand around our table  and take care of us; but she hardly cared. She seemed more interested in playing with a kid 3 tables away.  Food : I have always loved the food at Punjab Grill kormangala but this one here at Orion was such a shame to the name. Starters were mostly very dry and serving sections had very little of each of them for 5 people to pick even one serving at a time simultaneously. Of all the starters only Shrimp was good and mushroom was average. Salad counter was right beside serving station , so every time you are picking a salad you see used dirty dishes kept a few feet away. Salads too were very mediocre. Coming to main course , utter disappointment. In rice there was only chicken biriyani (which again was very dry) to be eaten alongside gravies such as paneer tikka masala , butter chicken , dal makhani and amritsari fish curry. Gravies tasted just average. Dal makhani and butter chicken were a bit better. We ordered for 1 roti basket and got 1 Naan and 1 Tandoori roti in it. Dessert was a saviour. Gulab jamuns were yumm and phirni was nice though it smelt like the milk was bit burnt but i can let it go for the overall taste that it gave. yule log cake was blah and Atta pinni was just fine.  Overall , this place was the worst Christmas dinner experience , specially when it was also a farewell dinner for one of our friend. We paid 5475 / - in all for 5 people and nobody enjoyed any of it. It was such a waste of money and time (including the waiting time of 45 minutes) . Even if I'd want to go to try Ala Carte there ; I dont think i would due to the hopeless service that they gave. Frankly speaking now I'm skeptical to go back to the kormangala one as well (haven't been there for a long time, not sure if they have deteriorated to same level)."
3.0,Excellent service. Friendly courteous and polite.  But extremely expensive. The food quantity was not worth the amount. Service was good but the prices were exorbitantly high.
4.0,"Best for indian veg n non veg food... few dishes are priced too high..they have buffet options too... decent options in there.. good staff , good ambiance.. worth a go after you are dead shopping!!!"
1.0,I was extremely disappointed... I have been to the one in koramangla so I expected the same from this place as well.. I went around 3pm with family and we ordered khadai shahi paneer and rotis. The rotis seemed like hard rubber and the curry was extremely bad. The onions were not roasted well and the base of the curry tasted extremely bad...
4.0,One of the best north indian food joint in Bangalore. Dal makhni is delicious and paneer was fresh. We enjoyed the garlic naan and butter rotis. The quantity is really good and one portion is good enough for 2 people. The service is quick and the staff is courteous. Their seating arrangement needs improvement.  Ambience 3.5 Food 4 Service 3.7
2.0,"Place is cramped. Buffet is very disappointing. Very limited options. No chicken/mutton biryani in the buffet. Only veg biryani was available.  A la carte has an average preparation time of more than an hour. Gluab jamun and rasgulla are below average. Kheer and Paneer kebabs are amazing. Those are the reason I gave 2 rating.  Understaffed like crazy. We had to ask 5 times for an item for it to be served. Super expensive-more than BBQ Nation, but variety, service and quality of food is below average. Very little value for money."
5.0,It's  a great place for authentic  Punjabi food ! Special mention to Sabuj for serving food with a  big smile- I tried veg dish and Panner was really well grilled and had typical punjabi masala
5.0,"Absolutely love this place! . all staff were very welcoming and friendly, .ambience was great too. Basically Dal Makhani  really excellent.The food came very quickly almost 15 to 16 mints.good for service sabuj"
1.0,"After so much negotiation we got a table @2:30 for a lunch, we planned to have the buffet and were surprised by the varieties they offer. 2 veg/2 non-veg starters. 2 curries, 1 rice item for the main course and 1 sweet for desert :( is just not a good lunch. The staff were friendly and the food taste and quality is pretty good. But the options is not worth what that charge(~900 Rupees)."
5.0,"Had a great meal thanks to Mr.Sabuj who was a great host and a lovely person. :) Great experience!   Specially loved the ambience, music and hospitality"
5.0,"Service was good by neeraj, the food was awesome and the ambience was good. Enjoyed alot. Will visit again soon and i would recommend to people to visit as well."
5.0,fantastic food great ambience courteous stewards ...just loved it . Neeraj was fantastic in his work ..explained about foods and beverages served in detail.. totally a great experience
1.5,"Very poor service . Food that was served had no taste at all. Ordered soya chaap and ravalpindi chole ,one of the most spicy dishes but was too disappointed with it. Would not recommend it to anyone in future."
1.5,"Hmmm. Where shall I begin my insipid reviews!   To begin with we were served the champ tajdar (lamb chops) which arrived at the table way too early for intricacy in preparation. On top of that which it was served barely warm.  This was followed by mediocre Chaat.  As for the main course, don't go by the staff's recommendation, cause neither do they help nor do they understand your palette. The makani chooze 1965 , should remain it's era with poorly flavoured tomato gravy.  The Indian breads further disappointed with the half cooked roomali, the only saviour was the garlic Naan.  To sum it up , the only saving Grace was the lassi, where the sugar did the talking.  Oh the finger bowl was just another luke warm ending to the afternoon.  To sum it up for a restaurant positioned to be a fine dining setup it definitely didn't make the mark and the bill was no saving grace"
1.0,Probably should be in negative. Thanks to their idiotic service. They have a bunch of useless staff because of whom we didn't complete our meal either.
3.0,"Very congested. Overall, not worth the price. I would prefer to go to some other restaurant. Food is above average so if you don't have any good North Indian option then you can visit."
4.0,Punjab Grill kicks off with its second restaurant at Orion Mall. The food as usual is of great quality. We took the buffet here and werent disappointed. The only minus point about taking the buffet was that it was too cramped near the buffet counter. The prices are quiet high but definitely stands true to quality.
4.0,"I would like to start the review with service charge drama , the menu card although had mentioned about service charge 10% which again was waived off when I asked the  manager. Coming to food I felt the non-veg menu was more than compared to veg. You hardly have any dishes for the vegetarians. You would find very few veg starters and rice items. Over all the food was good, loved the Keasari Dum Biryani. Starter and soup was not that great."
5.0,The food was unique and delicious. The service was taken care by Shanti who did a great job. She suggested the right food for our guests who accompanied us this time. A good space for family and friends.
5.0,"We finalized on Punjab Grill for my Parent wedding anniversary dinner. We were a group of 7 family members and each one of us just loved the food as well as the service. Recently opened in Orion mall, this is definitely one of the best option for North Indian food. Bhatti da murgh was one of the favorite that night. Don't forget to ask for the pan shot at the end of the dinner. Vegetarians in our group also loved the food. Only downside is that they didn't have the liquor license at the time of our visit. Special thanks to the lady who served us that night. Would definitely recommend trying it out at least once."
1.0,Worst service.. heavily prized.. you will totally forget what you ordered because of the pace of service...  difficult to get water also. Never ever visit this place
5.0,Absolutely loved the food!   The seafood and lamb items on the menu are top notch and a must try. The mutton biryani was perfectly cooked and tasted great.
5.0,Shanti was courteous and was extremely helpful. We had a great dinner time. Food was great. We were able to spend a good memorable moment. Ambience was pleasant.
4.5,"To start off with i love North Indian food! This is the place to go to if youre a north indian food lover. The service was very good. We were served with wet towels which was so refreshing and which most places dont do. The starters were amazing, being a big lover of prawns we repeated that dish twice. The crab too. I loved the paneer tikka , they were nice and fluffy. The galouti kabab melted in my mouth. The main course was hot and yummy , we had butter chicken and garlic naan. And to end this amazing meal, hot gulab jamun and ras malai which was the cherry on the top"
