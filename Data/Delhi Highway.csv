2.0,"Its a family place and food is not up-to the mark. I ordered dal makhani (not good), bread basket, malai kofta (okay).Overall experience was not so great, thought that north Indian food will be delicious."
5.0,Staff were friendly Guru and Piyush . nice ambience Food was good and we got Jain food also which was our major requirement. Nice place to have food. Highly Recommend
4.0,"Visited this place while roaming around in Indiranagar for a quick snack. Although it was about to close for dinner preparations, they welcomed us and took good care of us. If you ever have the craving for some ""Desi"" UP style food(veg of course), then this is the place to go. The decor is a little bit too much but the service and food are very good.  #Food: 4 #Service: 3.5 #Ambience: 3 #Value for money: 3.5"
4.0,Good option if you're looking for a pure vegetarian restaurant. Taste is also good. I would suggest to add on more options to the menu. Ambience is great. Quite cozy and peaceful.
5.0,"The place has an amazing feel, super royal. The food was great!! The server was super sweet. His name was guru! I highly recommend the lassi!!"
5.0,"Great place for some good food. Turned out to be a pure veg restaurant, an added bonus. Loved the starters.. the drinks served were heavy and the food was just right.. the place gets crowded very fast. The food and the ambiance fit perfectly. A must visit, booking a table in advance helps. Zomato Gold is also useful here.  Courteous staff, prompt service. Thanks.,"
5.0,"Tasty food and good staff, the only thing is the dont serve non-veg.  Overall the food was good and service was quick. Nice ambiance as well"
5.0,Very good food and hospitality. The food ignites the core Java Indian taste. Very good hospitality by Sultan. Very helpful and energetic. The mung dal halwa is best in town.

5.0,"This place is one of our favourites. Gali Parantha wali combo with paneer paratha is just outstanding. Extremely courteous staff with quick service. Call for Mr. Nath, and you will be well taken care of."
1.0,"Everything that we wanted to order was not available-exotic sizzlers, tostados, broccoli pesto,etc. Most of dishes which were written as jain were not prepared in Jain style. The restaurant is rated 4.4 to only mislead outsiders."
5.0,Best quality Delhi flavoured food available in Bangalore. Liked the varieties offered plus a great ambience makes it worthy to spend a quality dinner time. Must try dish is Dal makhani
5.0,Awesome food..lovely place....awesome ambience...simply loved it.. well trained staff...Rehman (staff who served us) is really so cooperative and friendly.........must visit
4.0,"Environment, crowd and setup is good. In food Platters are the ones to must haves. Lassi was a bit sour, might be due to curd quality, that gave a weird taste of Lassi. So better go for thandai. We ordered paneer lababdar, it was completely tomato based curry and was missing garlic and onion or even any taste of spices. It was missing the actual taste of paneer lababdar. Service and customer management is very good.They all are soft spoken and you will have a pleasant visit. The person responsible for handling our table, Sultan, is a star..treat him with a smile"
4.0,The interiors are beautiful.  Its a vegetarian restaurant (we found out after we saw the menu)  Paneer Tikkas were great.  A must visit for all the vegetarian folks!

5.0,Best vegetarian place in bengaluru for North indian cuisine. new experimental dishes with amazing taste.the best thali u will find in the city . go for it u will enjoy the experience. Good ambience but gets crowded easily. So go for an early reservation.
3.0,"The restaurant is very much overrated. I had lunch with my wife this Saturday at this place. I was excited to go to this place with the ratings and reviews, but was disappointed with the lunch finally. We ordered A-la-carte. I actually was surprised to see that they don't have Gobi in their curry menu. The food tasted bland. Only savior were paneer tikka and aloo tikki chaat. The ambiance was as well moderate with wall paintings round the place.  On the whole, not so great experience!!!"
5.0,"Good food. Nice service, recommend for dinner, the chats are good and overall it is good. Guru and Salman served us with best services. A must place to visit in indiranagar"
5.0,We went to the delhi highway and eat 3 north indian subji out of which veg kadai was the really really good option choosen by us. Also the other two subjis was good. Staff was very friendly and ambiance of delhi highway is excellent.
3.0,"Nice ambience. Taste was okay, similar to North India, but kinda pseudo-Delhi. Everything is heavy, like too much oil and too much paneer. But still better than other so-called North Indian restaurant. Wait time today was 45 minutes for us. Even others who had booked table online had to wait before getting table. Overall it was okay types."

3.0,"We went to this place lookinh at the reviews in Zomato, however I feel the place is overhyped. No doubt they havegood variety of Delhi style street food - From Chole Bhature to Chur Chur Naan. The waiting time is too much so if you planning to go there specially during weekends, make online reservations."

5.0,"We were a group of 7 and had good time. Great ambience, amazing food. Starters were really good. Main course was nice. Staff was very courteous and polite."
4.0,The place is awesome for its ambience and the food tastes exceptionally good with decent portion size of starters and desserts as well. The service is good and the folks are pleasent smiling faces. I just found that it's slightly overpriced given the dishes (though very tasty) are not really exotic ones. Overall a good experience

5.0,Very good food. Service was very good. We really enjoyed our dinnee with Delhi Highway. We really liked their starters and chaats. Thank you Deepa
1.0,This one of the highest rated restaurant in Indiranagar area on Zomato. That's not true. We were a group of 10 people went to celebrate my wife's birthday and we made booking 8 days in advance. They took 25 minutes to give us a table. Service was extremely pathetic and food was below average. It took them 2 hours and 20 minutes to serve us 2 course meal.
5.0,Guru and Salman give good service and very nice atmosphere good food must taste the food there and have the lassi there it's different and also try desserts .......................
5.0,"Food was good and staff also very courteous sultan and deepun served us well. We ordered sizzler platter in stater, panner chef special and garlic naan.all tastes good"
5.0,This is a fantastic place for North Indian Food. Especially if you are looking for Jain options too. The chholle and the Chur Chur Naan are absolutely fabulous. Highly recommended.
5.0,Very good food. Excellent ambiance. Excellent service.. Rahman gave us a very good service and took very good care about everything. Best game place to go for North Indian food.
1.0,"To being with, my first choice of food wasnt available. Mix Chaat was not available. Platters were. It applicable to Zomato Gold discount. Kulfi too wasnt available and on asking I was told that restaurant and kulfi in the menu has been around for 3 years but it has never been available!"
5.0,One of the great vegetarian restaurant in indira nagara food was delicious nice ambiance service was great polite stuff special sultan and captain Dipun good job
1.0,The food was not upto the mark. It took more than 1 hour to serve the main course after the starters. Ambience is the only one thing that drives us to the restaurant.
5.0,"The place is vegetarian but surprisingly amazing food. The paneer tikka achari, and dal makhani were the highlight. Excellent food, good service."

5.0,"Amazing ambiance, Great Taste !!! Must try Mexican cheese balls , choore choore naan ... Great service by sultan .... Enjoyed the food it was delightful ... The place is very clean and price for food is very reasonable ..."
2.0,"No one to seat you, no one to offer water or the menu. You have to remind them several times for each request you make. Please fend for yourself when you go here. I was told a menu item was not available, after which I saw several people order it and receive it too. The food was just average, not worth the price at all. Fancy interiors do not a restaurant make."
5.0,As a non vegetarian this place is excelled itself. Their paneer paratha combo was too good. Salman was a very considerate waitor. Nandans food was the best vegetarian food that took me back to Delhi
3.0,"5 of us went to Delhi highway on a Friday night to celebrate our parents anniversary. We were allotted a comfortable table and even though our initial scanning was of the alacarte menu, we ended up opting for five thaalis. Let me start by saying, the thaalis were of wonderful portions, optimum options and some lovely staff who are hospitable enough to cajole you into going for second helpings. The let down however, was the food in itself. While there was nothing bad about it there was nothing out of the ordinary either. Perhaps it's the fact that there are too many North Indian outlets to choose from, the tastes are all starting to feel similar and basic. Add to that the fact that the restaurant was crowded and staff running everywhere, you don't get the experience that you see described in the reviews."
4.0,"Location and ambience : The restuarant is located in a very convenient and most happening locations of Bangalore. I love the interiors of the restuarant as it gives a feel of Jaipuri style hotels in the hustling bustling city of Bangalore. Seats are comfortable and a prior booking will help you get a place without any delays.  Food : The best part about the restuarant is that it is a vegetarian restuarant so you can order anything without having a second look at the menu.  We had a four course meal and I must say the food is amazing and as the restuarant name suggests reminds of a delhi highway dhaba food.  We had one of their platters for the starters which had a good variety including mushrooms, kebabs, paneer and corn. We also had methi matar malai, a paneer based dish and variety of breads, all of which were well cooked and delicious.  Service : I believe, the main fallback of the restuarant was its service. The service staff was polite and good but seemed to lack training. To top it up the food was not served hot. Though the food was amazing, a service lag is what people always remember.  All in all, Its a great place to go for some delicious North Indian food."
4.0,"Our go to place for pure vegetarian food. Slightly on the expensive side, but it's a great place to go once in a while with family. The ambience is lovely. Most of our birthdays and other parties have been here. Usually we go in huge groups. Mostly, we order the thali. The naram dil kabab is amazing, a must try. The starters are decent. Love the veg biriyani that they give. The sweets, especially gulab jamun, can get a little better. Overall, a wonderful place if you're looking for pure vegetarian food with a lovely ambience and experience."
5.0,Great food !! Someone nostalgic about Delhi food this is a must visit place . Chilli achar made in mustard oil that is provided as complimentary is a must have. We have ordered veg sheek kababs Lahori paneer which are totally perfect . Staff service is up to the mark we were server by Roshan and Sultan who were very courteous .
5.0,The Staff is very organised and food is very tasty. A perfect food after a hectic day at office. The presentation and the timing are all perfect and interior reminds me of Rajasthan.
5.0,Very nice food and ambience love the food and also love the service of the place and the persons are very polite and most imp Padam Nath and Shankar nath had provided a good service
5.0,"Went for a sunday dinner, had the best langarwali dal, paneer delhi style with garlic naan. Our host, padam nath, was a very warm human, suggested us some mouth watering starters. We loved the ambience, the quantity justifies the price, had an amazing time"
4.0,"Great ambience. Most importantly, the right taste. It's not the kind of place where dish A and dish B would taste the same. Genuine effort to make the taste right and authentic. Would I go back? Yes..."
2.0,"Below average food. We ordered a seasonal kalmi aam starter, but the starter had absolutely no taste of aam. The paranthas were very thick and difficult to eat. Masala chaas was good."
5.0,"Good service done by Mr.Nath . Particularly paneer tikka , dum biryani, completely North Indian stoppage . If u r looking for North Indian taste then u found a right one"
2.0,"First of all, I would recommend against this restaurant if you wish to eat authentic North Indian food. The food here isn't authentic by any means, it's flavourless/bland. We ordered Aloo Tikki Chaat, which tasted good, and that was the best food item there which we ordered. For main course, we ordered Rajma, and Paneer with Mushroom and these two dishes were very flavourless. For drinks, we ordered Peach Ice Tea and Buttermilk, and both of them were average. On top of my experience here, I am not very confident on the quality of the food here either. I got stomach ache the next day and then an infection. Overall, spend your money on a better place like Kapoor's Cafe. They might not have an ambience as good as Delhi Highway, but their food is authentic for sure."
4.0,Delhi highway will give you the royal feel with amazing service and food quality. This pure veg place in Bangalore is completely to go for. The desserts on their menu give you the best North Indian desserts in bangalore at Delhi Highway. Jalebi rabadi is one of my favorites on the list
4.0,Great North Indian food with good service. Location is the key factor. Wide variety of Indian breads. However some dishes taste the exact same having the same curry you might wanna look into it
4.0,Vegetarian Delight. This place takes care of your love for food.. The tasty offerings with unique spice blend will be on your tongue and will remind you this place.. I loved all the served dishes.. It has beautiful lighting and ambiance and service was quick too.. Would love to visit this place again. Overall 4/5  1+1 on food is available here for Zomato gold users
4.0,"It's one of those restaurants in Bengaluru that offer genuinely good Vegetarian food and with most of the Vegetarian food options available.  We went for a Lunch. It's the kind of place more about Meals, Lunch and Dinner. We ordered the Roti, Naan and Kulcha along with Dal Makhani and Kadai Paneer. All of them really good to try. We also tried the Masala Papad and Fresh Lime.  The seating and the ambience along with the Food taste makes it a decently good restaurant."
5.0,The Quality of food was excellent. The starters especially were great.The softest Paneer I ever had. Lovely team and a Great customer service by Nath
1.0,Really disappointed with the food been served. The service is quite slow and unresponsive. None of the food items met expectation. The ambience won't do any good if the food doesn't have good taste.
3.0,"We went on a hot sunday afternoon. We booked table @2pm but still we had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table The food was okay, we liked dahi ki kabab and apple mohito. Rabdi with jalebi was okay. Matar kucha and mix veg parata combo was not good. I guess it depends on your tastes. If you care for your health don't try any of these maida items"
5.0,"Undoubtedly one of the best vegetarian north Indian cuisine. This place truly justifies its name, you will get that typical Delhi taste in every dishes.. If you haven't visited this place and looking for a good decent place to have authentic north indian dishes you should definitely go..And don't miss their Chur Chur naan combo and Delhi Special paneer, just too good.. And also very good and prompt service , special mention Rahman, rightly suggested what we choose. Would definitely like to come again.."
4.0,Awesome and tasty food with varied veg options. A bit high priced though. Ambience is good with nice palace design patterns. Must go to if you crave for North desi hygienic food. #tastyfood #goodambience #mustdine
5.0,Great food. Good service by Padam Nath. Really enjoyed the Palak papadi chat as well as the fusion pasta. There is some wait time but worth it.
5.0,Nice ambience. Service by Mr Padam Nath was awesome. Liked it more than food. Food was tasty as well. Would definitely recommend. Great experience ! !
5.0,Amazing food that is authentic as advertised. The Lassi was out of the world. Extraordinary service complimented by a wide variety of dishes. Was looking for a pure veg North Indian restaurant and this fit the bill perfectly. Definitely a never to miss place in Indira Nagar.
4.0,Food was awesome.. one of the most authentic north Indian food I had in Bangalore.  Only issue was with the service.. to slow and too bad. But worth visiting for the food taste.
5.0,Food was really good and got very good hospitality specially by padamnath. Paneer delhi style was very good i would love to come again over weekend
1.0,"We went to delhi highway for a lunch party. We chose this place as the reviews on zomato are really good and the rating is on a very high side. However, we were really disappointed by the taste of the food. The place is expensive and not worth the money. Most of the starters served were tasteless. A simple dal makhni that is cooked well by any random place was also not up to the mark. There are a lot of good places to eat in indiranagar so will definately not recommend this one. The ambience is good but after all the food is what matters the most."
4.0,"Food is good despite the prices being a little on the higher side. But it is a good place to go to specially if you are going with the family. Was here for lunch with the family and they loved it.   The menu is varied and there is much to choose from. Chats and starters were the highlight of my visit...so much so that my 2 year old nephew also loved the new things he got to taste haha. This was typically Delhi food and my search for something from the streets of Delhi was met here  Ambience is good, though the waiting area can get a little warm. Service can get a little slow during peak hours so go prepared for that. Book your table in advance and be there on time to avoid the queue."
4.0,"Lovely ambience...was here for their thali...completely worth it..great taste   Its usually very crowded on the weekends, weekdays are less crowded..booking a table advance helps.  Their chats and starters were yummy but little on the spicier side,the welcome drink was a little disappointing...main course was yum.  Highly recommand their Thali"
5.0,"Amazing place, nice ambience. Must for family.  Nice service from Padamnath. Amazing person  Tried amazing new dish, sahi seekh kabab, veg kadai and paneer tikka. Loved it totally."
5.0,Me and my friends celebrated Salary day in this restaurant. My friend gave his birthday party here. It was a amazing restaurant located at a very good place and you can find it easily by bus or by car. The service of the staff is appreciable and they also suggest how much quantity is sufficient as per person which is very helpful as we are 13 in number. Restaurant is a bit costly but worthand it is pure vegetarian. Vallet parking is available which is most needed in Bangalore. Food portions are good. You can use gold membership of zomato here. Jalebi Rabri is a must try.
5.0,"Ordered chole chawal from there today. I'm from Delhi and everyone knows that we're touchy about our dal makhni, rajma and chole chawal. I had been looking for authentic Delhi-style chole chawal for months in Bangalore and finally my search came to an end. Thank you Delhi Highway chefs. I am excited to try more dishes from your restaurant very soon."
5.0,"Good food, ambience and staffs. Sultan was assigned to our table and had been very friendly and courteous throughout. Really liked the service and ambience."
4.0,"A North Indian delight in Bengaluru, this one is a must visit for some delectable food. First thing to hit you is the Mughal architecture inspired decor, with arched windows and turquoise colour which lends Persian tones. Menu is extensive and can be a dilemma for foodies to choose from. Featured in the post- Raj kachori chat, Rajputana churma ladoo with spicy dal and jal jeera . The chat was balanced in taste with the crunchiness of katori. Combination of churma ladoo and spicy dal was new and nice , but quantity of dal was less. Jal jeera put the right note to end the sumptuous meal. All in all this one deserves a second visit"
4.0,"This place is good for having a soothing relaxed time with friends and family. Staff is polite and ambience is the USP of this place.one needs to book At least 2 days in advance if planning to visit during weekends as this place gets booked very fast and you wont get your preferred table otherwise.I highly recommend this place for their overall experience, value for money and hospitality.Some of the must have is Lassi and Jaljeera."
4.0,"It has good food and ambience. We tried  tandoori rolls,paneer makhani which were yum. Sultan served us well. good place for North Indian food in Indira Nagar"
4.0,"The ambience is the first thing that strikes you.. its a beautifully done place! The food (though we didnt try much) is reasonably good and the service is impeccable even with the crowd.. Special mention for Mr. Nath, whose service we really enjoyed during our visit here"
5.0,The food is very good. Ambiance is very good. Menu has some good items. Service is fast and very polite. Especially Sultan was very polite and served very good.
5.0,"A nice place for an evening, paneer lababdar with pudhina paratha was great. Also thanks Sultan for an awesome service! Keep up the good work"
4.0,"The chats here although on the expensive side are really delicious and the ingredients used are very fresh, Had the Dilli ki Mashoor Aloo tikki chat was very tasty and so was the gobi ki parantha"
5.0,"North Indian Vibes. Delicious food with great ambience Try Rajchori in exact Delhi style, paneer tikka platters in starters For Dessert: Jalebi Raberi is awesome. Great service by Padam Nath."
5.0,Nice ambience and food was delicious. Service by padamnath and service was best and i tried dahi papti chaat which was awesomeand do check classic paneer tikka platter.
5.0,A contemporary and charming place to enjoy family time. Heaven for vegetarians to enjoy the delicacies of North Indian food. We ordered a buffet that included around 20 items. Starters were great. Special mention to pani puri and their paneer tikka that was soo soft and yum...Dal makhani was one of the best items in the main course. Must visit the restaurant for vegetarian people. A la carte menu is also an option if the buffet is too much for your palate.
5.0,"LOVE THIS PLACE. The best place for North Indian food in Bangalore and I'd definitely recommend this to one and all. We ordered tandoori cheese aloo for starters, which was dum aloo with a tandoor roasted coating and cheese on top. A bit too spicy for my liking but a very filling serving. For main course we ordered a sabzi which consisted of paneer and pyaaz, roomali rotis and kulchas. I'M ABSOLUTELY IN AWE OF THEIR PANEER. It is super soft, and literally the melt in the mouth kinds. Its also one of the few places with which still serve roomali rotis which makes it even better.  We couldnt finish the sabzi as it was just two of us, however it was fresh even when we had it the next day. We couldn't stop licking our fingers and I can only crave more of this. Please do visit this place if you like North Indian or LOVE PANEER.  The place is slightly expensive, however it wasnt too much of an issue for us given we had Zomato Gold."
4.0,"I have been to Delhi Highway a couple of times now. Their food is great and the service is quick. The ambience is decent. If you're looking for a place to have great North Indian food with friends or family, I'll definitely suggest this place.  We had ordered the Sizzling Platter for starters which has a combination of mushrooms, Paneer, Potato and their veg kebab starters. While everything was delicious, the kebabs were the best.  For main course, we went with Malai Kofta, Sirke Pyaaj waala Paneer, Dal Sunehri. The malai kofta decidedly is one of the best I have ever had with just the right amount of sweet. The Paneer was a distinctive take on pickled onions and tastes brilliant and the Dal was nicely cooked.  They have a wide variety of options for breads and their lachha parantha and garlic naan are just what you would expect from a good north indian place. No surprises there.  Overall, it was a great experience. It gets extremely crowded though on weekends and table bookings may get delayed. So be prepared and reach early."
1.0,"This was the 7th time I visited the place...but the experience was totally distraught. The sizzler meal options were not there ... As well as a couple of other dishes we asked for was also not there. The person who took the order was disrespectful and rude. Ordered veg pulav and what we got was so called basmati rice tossed in ghee with 5 pieces of beans, 8 peas, and half a tsp grated paneer... The worst experience..."
4.0,"Tried items - malai kofta, pindi chola, paneer tikka, dahi kebab - food was good Ambience is very good Service - Padam nath, very friendly and timely service"
4.0,One of the best north indian restaurants in Bangalore. The ambience is really good. And the service is great and quick. A lot of options to choose from. The tandoor items are exceptionally good. A must visit for vegetarians.
3.0,I had ordered rajma chawal meal three times from this place and they reduced the quantity and quality of the meal each time. Badly dissapointed!!
5.0,Good service and nice place. Price is little expensive for the quantity. Few items on the menu not available. Overall nice experience but expensive.
5.0,"Food was good, very well serviced by padam nath. I would like to recommend it for family dinner surely.Ambience is Royal like Delhi . Dishes are spicy and good."
5.0,Ambience is awesome. Server Padam Nath was really nice and served us the best way possible. They served us Jain food as per our requirements. Cool ambience with great food and hospitality
1.0,"Extremely bad food, not sure how come they 4 ratings. Starters were okay but Main course were horrible. We ordered Chur chur naan and got a smethg else, Dal Makhani was tasteless and kutcha we ordered was pathetic. Daal baati was more like raagi biwl. Even Halwa was pathetic and on top of that when we provided feedback to Mgr, he didnt reach at all. Definitely not recommended to people who knows N.I. Food."
1.0,"Nothing Delhi about it, too much delay in serving food. Very dissatisfied with the food. Chur chur naan was nothing like churchur. Chhole tasted horrible. And kulcha we ordrerd was pathetic. Daal baati was more like raagi bowl, they don't not how to cook daal baati. Delhi speacial lassi which was served in a small cupsize size kullad had nothing special about it. Don't try ordering anjir ka halwa, such a disappointment."
4.0,Best place for vegetarian/Jain food !! Have been here almost 5 times and everytime it an amazing food experience. Service boy Padmnath was also very courteous and helpful. Definitely a go to place for weekend brunches!!:)
4.0,"Awesome Delicious Veg dishes .we have ordered Mixed veg Kulche , Butter Roti , Paneer Tika Masala , Malai Kofta . Out these Mixed Veg Kulcha and Paneer tika masala was just superb. Chole is also spicy and very well prepared . Rabri and jalebi also in deserts is outstanding . Just need to improve in services , it was not quick at all . Table booking for same is recommended specially if you are planning on weekends . Overall very worth for cost and taste . Keep it up guys ."
5.0,"Blue and golden colored theme with Mughal architecture styled windows and doors gives it a royal look which enhances its decor and ambience.  When it comes to food, I liked all the items . Dahi ke kabab and Veg Seekh kabab were good. I liked Shahi Mughlai Paneer the most in main course mainly because of its slightly sweet taste. Oh, and one more thing, its a vegetarian restaurant. Before coming here, I was expecting that this place will serve some authentic mughlai non vegetarian dishes as well such as chicken jahangiri.  Staff was friendly and quick.   Food:3.5 Ambience:4 Service: 4"
5.0,"Food was awesome, specifically cheddar mushroom. Really liked the ambience and hospitality. Tried paneer had fun enjoyed and ate mushroom nath good service"
5.0,The food here was very yummy specially the Dahi seekh kabab and the shahi Tukda. I came here for some good jain food which I was able to get. Service by: Mr. Padam Nath
5.0,The staff was polite and co.operative thankyou to sultan who sugessted dishes at this new place..visiting again ambinece was decent..taste 3.5/5
3.0,"Purpose of Visit: Dinner with small group of friends  Day and time: Sunday @8:30 ( waiting for 40~50 mins)  Taste: North Indian Taste  Dishes Tried: 1. Choor choor Naan ( Repeated order, Awesome stuffing, Perfect spices with garnishing of sorted bkack Jeera served with dal makhni, raita, chole) 5/5  2. Dahi ke kabab -6 pieces -- tasted so-so nit much mouth watering, because dahi used was too soft ( Dilli wala taste nhi aaya) 2.5/5  3. Golgappe -- Again so-so (expecting dilli wale golgappe ka taste) Served with boondi as filling ; No Aloo served -- Additionally served with orange and cranberry test tube size sryup to fill. 2/5  4.Drinks/beverges are worst -- If they writing spicy Gauva they meant it like anything. Only and only black peeper burn your mouth. Mocaa mint shake again weird combo. Most of the drinks were unavailable like kiwi snow etc. Although u can rely on desi JALJEERA.  PADAM, the Waiter served and treated us well. He is happy go lucky kinda of person.  Can visit again only for chur chur naan.  #Delhi #NorthIndian #ChoorChoorNaan #ChurachurNaan #Padam #DelhiHighway"
3.0,Beautiful interior. But I really did not find any taste in the main course. Starts were rather good. Hope they will work on improving their mains. Thank you!
4.0,Place is good for it's ambience. Food is also good. Paneer Lababdar and Dahi sheekh kebab is a must try here. Didn't like the Kashmiri Aloo Dum and Haryali Mix veg. The masala in aloo Dum was kind of ok. The spinach gravy was intense and blocked the flavours of vegetables.
5.0,"One of the best vegetarian restaurant at Bangalore.... The starters like naramdil kabab ,pesto paner Tika and dahi bhalla chat was yummy.... The best thali restaurant.... I recommend this restaurant for all.."
5.0,Good food and good people Amazing tacos Loved paneer lababdar  Good rumali roti  Amazing ambience Kala khatta mohito was very good as well  Good service by Pradeep

5.0,It was my second at this amazing North Indian outlet. The ambience and Vibe was good as always. Our server Mr. Nathan was polite and made some good recommendations.
1.0,"All right, so the food is good no doubt about it. But the service should definitely improve. The waiter denied to serve us sizzler lying that they haven't tried making it yet until we saw a lot of others ordering the same. Won't ever recommend anyone going here just because of this experience of mine."
5.0,"This is a nice place. Had come hear for team lunch .we had only veg food, it was good. Planner Delhi style was awesome. Mr Nath and Shankar service was good."

5.0,Amazing food. Thanks Padam Nath ji and Sultan Sir for great service. The ambience and choice of music is in harmony with the tasty food served.
4.0,Nice food with good quantity n quality. Service was good too. located near road with vallet parking. Zomato gold made bill looks little less expensive
5.0,This restaurant is exceptionally good. The ambience is beautiful. Thali had a good combination of dishes and pretty reasonable for what they offer. The taste is good too!
4.0,"I will rate this place 4/5. I went for a lunch here, everything we ordered was good, undoubtedly it tastes amazing, finger licking but only thing I am disappointed about, is that I found it a little costly. The food quantity and the price is really i felt overpriced. Specially the parathas."
5.0,We have come for celebrating our nephew's birthday...service was very prompt...Salman was upto d mark in serving...we will visit again for sure.
5.0,"Amazing food and amazing service, by Pradeep and Roshan. Starters were amazing paneer tikka Rice dum biriyani Subz veg Karachi loved the ambience and the crowd is also really good"
5.0,Fantastic food. The panner dishes were especially good. Great ambiance. Good place for team lunch. And nice place which is pure vegetarian. Must try
5.0,"Great service. Good north indian food! Even quantity was good. Thanks to our waiter Sultan! Since zomato doesn't allow reviews below 140 chars, here is some stupid shit!"
3.0,Facade and ambiance on point but food is not truly Delhi Style.Ordered few items like rotis and curries during my last visit but was really disappointed.
5.0,Our first visit to this place and I can already picture myself coming back. Wonderful ambience and great food. Also the staff Is very courteous especially Guru . Thank you for a great experience.
1.0,The restaurant did not meet the expectation at all in terms of taste. They claim to serve authentic  North Indian food but trust me its nowhere close. the food is as pathetic as any north indian is frustrated of in Bangalore and then try to search for authenticity.  I thought there prime usp was authentic north indian food but Yukkkk .  Zomato gold is not applied to some of the prime starters and thalis . So beware if you are visiting this place for this.  Waiters and their service is good as they keep an eye constantly on what you need and assure you if something is delayed.
3.0,The place is easy to find and looks good from the outside. The ambience is good but it has the potential to be so much better. We went on a Sunday afternoon. Had booked a table at 10 in the morning and were still made to wait 15 mins which wasn't an issue. The place gets really crowded and booking tables is recommended. The staff is courteous and did cater to us really well which was the only good thing about the place. The food was not worth the price. We found it tasteless or too sweet and the rice we ordered was just bland. The food is really pricey even with zomato gold and is definitely not worth the money. Indiranagar has a lot of other places that offer you better. Went with a lot of hope especially because of the rating but was just disappointed.  Ambience - 4 Staff - 4.5 Food - 3 Price - 2.5
4.0,"This is a 100% vegetarian restaurant. This restaurant has look like a palace dinning. I love this place. Its expensive in terms of pricing.   My personal favourite are Papad Churi, Broccoli and Cream Soup & Corn and Spinach with Mozzarella Cheese Soup in starters. In Delhi Highway Special I love Tandoori Baby Kulchas. This dish is also liked by kids. Those cheese lovers will relish this dish. Dal Delhi Highway which is a black dal is also awesome in taste. Its very creamy.   In deserts jalabi with rabadi is yum. Jalabi is adequately sweet and rabadi is blonde to compliment taste. Another tasty deserts is Kesariya Firni and Delhi Special Kulfi.   The menu is revamped recently. But all the Delhi Special items are still there.   Verdict: those who like a typical North Indian food taste will enjoy dining here."
1.0,The ambiance is great but don't judge a book by its cover. The food doesn't taste good. The price is way too high compared to the service and food served.
5.0,Amazing restaurant in Indiranagar for north Indian food. Loved the dessert and starters! The main course was equally good. The ambiance and service was excellent. I thank Padam nath for his service. Very humble. Great place! Do visit!
5.0,"Food, service and ambience is awesome. Veg seekh kabab was so yummy. I will come back again for your paneer Delhi style. Thanks for the service by Padam Nath and Shankar."
4.0,Not a great fan of north Indian food that too veg. But Delhi highway made me feel that why should only non veggies should have all the fun. Great dining experience. Super tasty food especially their dal. Must visit for vegetarians.
5.0,Great food and very courteous staff specially Bhagat Singh was very helpful in helping us choose the right food from the menu. I loved the Paneer Tikka very soft and fresh paneer a must try here
5.0,This place is awesome ... Great ambience ...staff was very cooperative and friendly specially Bhagat Singh ...and the best thing we had was Dal Makhni ...Do order that and ya watermelon mojito ...The real fresh Tarbooz peaces floating in it .. Had A great experience overall..
1.0,"Sorry to report a bad experience. I went with a friend of mine and took a table. The waiter comes in and I ordered a Lunch Thali. My friend was about to order his dish when the waiter said, No sharing. I asked him who ordererd a shared Thali. There was no sorry from the other waiters, but a senior waiter stepped in to deal the situation. Is this how customers are treated? Why did the waiter think that we are there to share thali? Absolutely insulting behaviour from the staff. Such hotels should be closed in Bengaluru. Be careful about the waiters here."
4.0,"It's an absolute delightful place for the Vegetarians. The Ambience is grand. The food is very good, one of the best places for a good North Indian cuisine. Absolutely worth the money. Great place to be with family. Kids friendly. Need to reserve your table, otherwise it's waiting time might go high. Friendly and courteous staff."
4.0,"I liked this places , food was good , ambience was soothing nice , food presentation was awesome and prices justifies there service , waiting time for food was little longer."
5.0,"One of the best places for North Indian food. All the dishes were good specially Malai kofta, it was perfectly cooked. Dal makhani was also upto the expectations. With zomato gold this place is definitely value for money. Ambience was soothing and staff was courteous. Out server was Sultan and we are happy with his services."
3.0,Nice comfortable place to be with good decor . The service is slow though . Not a good option for a big party. We were a group of 17 people and had fought time. The thali has a good spread and the Julian jamun too . Valet parking exists.
4.0,"I visited this place few days ago. It is a pure vegetarian restaurant, they have buffet and a-la-carte both, i tried buffet. The starters was very good in taste, specially dahi kebab and tandoori paneer tikka, but Varity is very less here, only four option they gave in starters. That's y my rating is 4*. Main course & desserts was good. They gave a complementary drink alsoOverall very good experience."
5.0,Amazing food at reasonable prices. Particularly loved the churchura naan. Excellent service by Pradeep and Sultan! Must visit place! Recommend this place to anyone wanting good birth indian food in Bangalore!
1.0,Just finished lunch here. Thali served is bad and way expensive. They mentioned lassi is their special. And it is bad and the mutki that they served smell very bad too.  Overall not a good place for North Indian food. Staff is equally bad and unresponsive.   Will not recommend.
4.0,"Been here for lunch with friends on Sunday. It was jam packed and we have to wait for some time before getting a table, so I suggest you to make reservations beforehand.  Blue and golden colored theme with Mughal architecture styled windows and doors gives it a royal look which enhances its decor and ambience.  When it comes to food, I liked all the items we ordered except for Badam Shorba. There was nothing wrong with it but i personally didn't like its taste. Dahi ke kabab and Veg Seekh kabab were equally good. I liked Shahi Mughlai Paneer the most in main course mainly because of its slightly sweet taste. Oh, and one more thing, its a vegetarian restaurant. Before coming here, I was expecting that this place will serve some authentic mughlai non vegetarian dishes as well such as chicken jahangiri.  Staff was friendly and quick. When we realised that we have over ordered few things and asked the staff to cancel one of the dish, he cancelled it. I liked it because i was expecting usual response like other places where they can't cancel items because our order ""just"" started getting prepared by chef.  Food:3.5 Ambience:4 Service: 4"
5.0,"Excellent food, great ambience best service friendly staff, best variety of food special thanks to Padam Nath, Pradeep and Sultan and Roshan ... recommend for all , trust you really love it....."

5.0,Very good north indian food courteous staff and good decor Paneer tikka and veg sheek kabab was awesome . Bhagath sigh was our waiter for the evening and done his job very well and politely
5.0,"Excellent place with wonderful service. The staff is very courteous. Ordered Bhalla Papdi Chaat, Parantha combos. Both were refreshingly authentic in taste, with just the right blends of spices. Strongly recommended."
5.0,The food is amazing  Also the service is quick... Ambience is great!!!! Padam Nath Ji served us well. Appreciate the hospitality of the team!!!! Must try Dal Makhni & Pineapple Raita...
4.0,Good Punjabi Food served. Staff who attended me was very courteous and recommended good dishes served by the hotel. Price point is at a higher side. Worth trying Chur Chur Naan which was served with choley and curd
1.0,"I don't think this review can be any more polite, I was aghast to find out that they charge a surplus of Rs30 on each bottle of bisleri above the mrp, well the food too failed to make up for this disappointment. The manager's excuse of software not being updated is simply lame. I guess this restaurant still practices the age old tradition of looting the common man by charging an extra service charge over and above the mandated GST. I wish the customers were a bit more aware of what they are paying and how much is actually legal and not daylight robbery."
5.0,The service done Padamnath was excellent. The ambience was good. Tried 1 starter and main course it was decent and taste was good. This is recommend
5.0,"The service was really good! Special thank you to Sultan and Bhagat! The food was also really good... The ambience and setting are very classy. Overall, a pleasant experience."
5.0,Food quality is quite good here awesome paneer tikka - one of its kind Decent paneer delhi style main course Helpful and cooperative staff (esp Padam Nath) Great time here
4.0,"Amazing food. Charcoal Mushroom and Langar wali daal must be tried. Service was delayed due to heavy rush, I am assuming that. But overall great place. Padam Nath served us. Phirni was not cold."
5.0,"This place has the best North Indian vegetarian food that I have had in Bangalore! I have been here at least 5 test in last 6 months and not even once I was disappointed. Y absolute favorite dishes are mozzarella kulcha. They serve hot cheese stuffed baby kulchas with some out of the world garlic chutney. You just can't resist those extremely delicious kulchas.  Next favorite thing is their vegetable biryani. It's actually wrongly called biryani and should be called as Vegetable pulav but oh my, that is so tasty. I don't know what specific thing I like about it, but I just like it.  Pao bhaji and garlic butter Pao is okayish, but that because I have a thing for road side paav bhaji. But their langarwali daal and Missi roti is beyond mouth watering.  The staff is courteous and the service is good. Not too much wait time. The ambience is slightly above average.  Food is reasonably priced. All in all, a must try for vegeterians."
5.0,Excellent vegetarian food. Great ambience and prompt service. Good for parties. Would certainly come back. Loved the starters especially Dahi ke kabab.
5.0,"Amazing food with the perfect ambience and great service by Mr. Padam Nath and Sultan. Dum biryani was quite good, and choor choor naan was lip smacking."

1.0,"Took 45 mins for breakfast to be served that too not fresh. Returned butter milk, it was tasteless and hot. Ghee used in paranthas was stale. Spoke to manager but he was least bothered. Not recommending for breakfast at all."
1.0,"This place is nothing what it looks like. Tasteless is the only word. They could not prepare a Pav bhaji properly. Also, Do NOT take thali. It's waste of money and you will regret it. At this location, there are far better options."
5.0,"Padam Nath - Great service and very humble. Welcomed with a welcome drink and it was awesome. Great Ambience, worth it !! Nice Music. Good to come with any crowd."

5.0,Awesome Service. Wonderful and tasty food. Kudos to the team. Food is awesome and so is the ambience. One can really taste their Thali which is very good
4.0,"The charcoal mushroom comes stuffed with paneer, is medium spicy and tastes nice. (4/5)  The Naram Dil ke kabab is paneer covered by a layer of corn flakes and fried but was not oily and tasted awesome, little spicy. (5/5)  The malai kofta was delicious, loved it(5/5)  The paneer lababdar is medium spicy and tastes fine. (4/5)  The garlic naan is good (4/5)  The pudina paratha was bad, it had too much of pudina and hence the taste was poor (2/5) The service and ambience is pretty good. (4/5)"
5.0,The taste of food is good. It is a good option for pure veg. We tried Dal Sunehri and Malai Kofta. Dal sunehri is a must try for those longing for home made food.

4.0,Had a good time here looking for the north Indian items. I liked the Indian desi style pasta here. Service was quite good serviced by Padam Nath. Must visit for fine dine looking for north Indian food!!
5.0,"A royal themed restaurant which stands out from the pleothra of other restaurants in the area. It has a lovely ambiance, the staff is courteous and food is awesome.  I went there for a family lunch and not just me but everyone liked the place and the food served by them.  The best part of the restaurant for me is that it is a pure veg restaurant which serves Jain food as well. Since my parents follow no onion & garlic rule, this place really proved to be a savior.  Like all other good things, this comes with a price. While the food is delicious it is little hard on the pockets, but the money being spent there is worth the food being served."
5.0,Delhi highway never disappoints. Very good food and great service by entire team especially Mr Padam Nath. Always a pleasure here. Consistently since last 2 years
2.0,"Decided to write the review sitting at Delhi Highway. This is the worst service I have come across in over 2 decades. The staffs are either clueless or absolutely lazy. The manager seems to be running around like a headless chicken. It took them 20 mins and 10 reminders to get us water. This level of service would have been tolerable at a lower price point but when you are spending upwards of Rs 350 a dish, it's not unreasonable to expect better service. If the Management is reading this, ""PLEASE PULL UP YOUR SOCKS"". Restaurants come and go in Bangalore so once the novelty wears off people will focus on quality. I recommend Management get out of their bubble and visit restaurants in Indiranagar to understand service."
1.0,"The food was okay, not good not bad. The service was not upto the mark. I went there looking at the Zomato ratings but after the visit, I am not satisfied at all."
5.0,Food was awesome. The staffs are cool. Padam nath and Shankar tended to us very nicely! Awesome place! Even better service. Chur chur naan was very good. The sizzling platter was nice too.

5.0,"Amazing food, courteous staff and prompt service by Mr.Nath. Had an amazing time. Saturday done right. #northindian. Lassi is highly recommended."
5.0,"Had a lovely Sunday lunch at this royal and beautiful, authentic Dilli style North Indian place.    Walking through the grand entrance, it looks like one of those house sets from Hindi serials, with staircases flanking on either side. On level zero is a small seating, with majority of it upstairs. The place has a rich golden  hued interior, complimented and contrasted perfectly by the sky blue shaded window spaces.  The same vibrance makes it's way to the dark brown tables with blue napkins standing out, amidst heavy brass Ware and cutlery. A mellow Desi beat in the background was perfect to groove to, not too loud to interfere.   Coming to what our hungry bunch was there for. FOOD.   Kicked off with the PANEER TIKKA PLATTER (495/8)  with 3 varieties, Afghani, Pesto and Classic. Loved the presentation starting from the sizzling platter that came as a surprise, the paneer itself was soft and juicy, marinated, spiced and charred to perfection. The smokey veggies went quite well contrary to my initial thoughts. A fusion executed well.  CHARCOAL MUSHROOMS  again were a big hit at our table. With a rich and delicious stuffing of cottage cheese and mushroom, it was a flavor explosion.   Next, as a break between starters and main course, tried the BHALLA PAPDI CHAAT (295/4) that was lovely. Crispy papdi chaat topped with soft bhallas full of juice.   Had the MATAR KULCHE (325), with matar again served on a sizzling platter. This was very authentic tasting, and we found it bland.   For mains, went with some suggestions from our captain, and rest with our gut. Adventurously enough, went for the PANEER DELHI STYLE (345)and MALAI KOFTA (345/2) and oh boy did we stop licking our fingers. I'm the kind who's always confused between paneer and mushroom, but to my rescue, the curry had both. A spicy chop masala instead of a heavy smooth gravy, smokey and delicious. The Malai kofta was on another level though. Nothing like any of us had had before. It wasn't sweet, and the gravy had a hint of green.   The ROTI BASKET (450) with about 6 varieties of well made Indian breads was enough for 4 of us and perfectly accompanied the delicious curries.   Lassi, part of the Thali, was served complimentary by the manager Mr. Sampath as a kind gesture. It tasted exquisite. Presented in a mud Kullhad, garnished with dry fruits and a creamy malai, I fought myself to stop at 1.   I don't normally do, but going with the flow of appetizing and delicious food that we were being presented with, couldn't help but not order dessert. Sadly, much of what we wanted had run out of stock.  Settled for RABDI JALEBI (200) that came in a huge portion. The sugar could be toned down slightly, and rabdi portion was quite small, apart from that, a perfect ending.   On a busy Sunday afternoon, when the entire place was packed, the manager Mr. Sampath himself attended to our table and hosted us beautifully with a wide smile. I didn't know that the Lassi was part of the Thali, but on asking for it, he brought it for all of us. Padam Nath was quick to serve us too.   To summarize, it was a near perfect experience, but the warm service just won my heart. Added to this was the shock we got on seeing the bill. Using 2 Zomato Gold unlocks, we were billed 2300 for 4 which I felt was great value.   Here's my overall SCORE: Food - 5/5  Ambience - 4.5/5  Service - 5/5  VFM - 4.5/5"

My friend ate just chilies during the hours of long wait between the starters. Business chalana nahi atta to sallo sikh lo kissi aur resturant mein jaa k  Starters : Paneer tikka ( good but was colder than an average cold coffee) Pani puri : BTM jaa k pani puri kha k kuch sikho, how to make pani puri Allo tatti: 290 rs for half kg of baked taste less allo ??? are you joking  Main course : COLD, TASTELESS, no salt, no spice ,cold rice, quantity was like 3 spoons when asked for more it took them 10 mins to give just 3 spoon if rice and by that time curry was and u can do the math on food service  LASSI: MORE SUGAR, LESS Curd in a nut shell if u want to welcome diabetes please go for bottoms up  WAS REALLY A WASTE OF TIME and MONEY, KOI MERE PAISSE DILWA DO YAAR"
5.0,From starting the service is good. Padam nath treated us very welll. Malai seekh kabab must try. It is fine dining restaurant and it is must try place
2.0,"Honestly speaking, I was not happy with the food of the restaurant. I mean the amount we paid for the food we got was not worth it. There was nothing special about this restaurant. Although ambience was above average and staff was courteous but somehow it failed to impress me as a food lover."
5.0,Complete typical family restaurant. Beautiful grand ambience. Food is really heavy and yummy so order limited quantity else you might end up wasting food.  Waiting is too much like any other good restaurant of Bangalore so you can guess about the food. Dessert is really awesome. We had Jalebi with rabri and gulab jamun which was very satisfying.  Little expensive so doesnt fall in 'all time favourite'. But food had perfect taste.
5.0,"Very good service, food. Mr. Rahman and Sufior is very polite. Paneer tikka and delhi paneer is very good. Will refer friends. Nice location."

4.0,"We decided to go to this place for a farewell dinner of a colleague, thought of using zomato gold... But then they had an option of unlimited thali @550/- which was totally worth it.  It is a pure veg restaurant.  Unlimited thali will have a welcome drink, 4 starters, 1 chaat item, 3-4 gravies, roti/Naan, biryani and 2 sweet items.  Taste wise all of them were very good and definitely above par... Good place to have great North i Dian veg food.  I am definitely going to recommend this and visit here again.  Only suggestion and complaint to management is to improve service... It could have been faster (was very slow)"

Staffs were very polite.. provided prompt service. Special thank to sofior for treat us well."
4.0,"Recently visited this place on a weekday dinner.. Surprisingly it was quite full for a weekday.. Well it's a total veg restaurant so veg lovers should definitely try this place.  Firstly, ambience is very slick. I liked it for their simplistic theme  Service - A tad bit slow  Food - we opted for their set thali for something around 520 bucks without taxes.. This is more like set buffet, one can eat unlimited amount from that set. There was one welcome drink, panipuri, chaat, soup, 4 types of starters, main course was one huge thali with veg biriyani, bread basket, daal, chana, paneer, veg handi, raita, salad.. for dessert there were two options- moong dal ka halwa and kheer. I found the soup slightly spicy.. Else other items were pretty good  I will definitely recommend this place for veg lovers.. The food is good and options are good as well."

5.0,"I had ordered a maharaja thali for 249... I felt all the items were apt with 2 starters, 3 dishes, rotis, ghee rice and all! But felt the absence of a dessert!"
4.0,"Delhi Highway has a very royal look to it when you enter. The ambience is stunning! The combination of blue and gold looks breathtaking.   Food-4.5/5  Service- 4/5 Ambience- 4.5/5  Value for money- 4/5  We tried the thali that day. The thali consisted of the following components-    Strawberry delight welcome drink was refreshing and cleansed the palate.   Tomato dhania shores was tangy and flavoured with loads of fresh dhania.   Masala papad had an overpowering peppery flavour which I didnt quite fancy.   Gol gappa shots- the puri was crisp, filled with boondi and the pani was tangy and spicy with hari dhania, black salt and char masala flavour   Palak patha chaat consisted of fried spinach leaves topped with cold yogurt with sweet jaggery tamarind chutney. Light hint of spice from hari chutney tied the whole thing together. It was quite delicious.   Achari paneer- the paneer was melt in the mouth. Extremely tender and the achari flavour was prominent with a hint of smokiness from the tandoor. I loved this the most.  Naram dil kebab was tender, mildly spiced and saunf flavour was prominent with seeds.   Makkai kebab was spicy and tender. It had a crisp coating on the outside.   Dahi kebab was on the sweeter side. Soft and fluffy centre with a crisp breadcrumb exterior   In the main course, the dal makhni was the star of the show. It was super creamy and tasted amazing. One of the best Ive had. The veg handi was good too. The Pindi chole was of the authentic kind. It had a deep colour which shows that they use tea extract in it to provide the depth in the flavour.  The angoori kofta curry had a sweet flavour of khoa and it was delicious. The Hyderabadi biryani too was delectable though it wasnt like the authentic biryani. All the bread varieties were soft and well cooked. The sweets were delicious too. It wasnt too overpoweringly sweet.   Overall I feel the thali is completely worth the money. Im not sure if the thali is available every day or it was a once in a while thing. A la carte on the other hand is quite expensive."
4.0,Had this amazing rajkachori at zomaland by selhi highway.. amazing northindian food they provide. However we ordered tawa sabzi with lavha parantha that also turn out to be amazing but this raj kachori literally taste like north food ..

3.0,"Always wanted to try their authentic North indian/Punjabi cuisine but never thought it would be via team lunch. We were a big bunch and I'm glad they could arrange for us without hustle.  Ambiance is elegant, well made Arabian/Persian theme adds to the valour of the restaurant. Spacious and well laid out seating.  Food, We simply opted for their unlimited maharaja thali. This is a good option if you're not sure about what to try on their menu. Both starters and main course is served fresh on the table. I will not get into the details of what's in the buffet but would stress on a few dishes I found exciting.  Tandoori aloo. Dahi papdi chaat. Paneer Tikka and Naram dil in starters. Dal makhni in the mains.  Service was a little slow. Maybe because the dishes took a lot of time. Staff is courteous."

3.0,"Rating:3.5 actually. We went with a big group for dinner on a  Friday night. The best part of their place is their Ambience ! Such a nice atmosphere to sit and talk. Has a royal felling especially with their lighting.  Coming to food, their broccoli soup was good , different. Starters we liked Tabdoori mushroom, dahi ke kebab was just ok. I have had better. Tried couple of kebabs in the lines of hara bara kebab. It was good.   Coming to main course, thier Naans are good, lasuni palak paneer was ok, ordered because it had some good reviews, mixed veg kadai was also ok...Chur Chur Naan was good but wasnt worth the price ! But I must say the Chole which accompanied it was amazing, dal makhani wasnt great...  Overall,food could have been better. Good service by Sultan !"

The service staff seemed to be busy that day to take orders but once taken the food arrived well on time!  We ordered:  Broccoli and cream soup Creamy Mushroom soup Overall experience with soups wasnt so good and I wouldnt recommend ordering soups from here.  Paneer tikka Charcoal mushroom  Dahi ke kebab Pumkin dahi kebab All starters were delicious and you can safely pick out anything you like from the menu.  Vegetable kadhai- literally came in a kadhai, tasted good Paneer makhanwala- absolutely creamy and delicious  Black dal- creamy and tasty  Tandoori roti- this didnt feel freshly made as it had hardened by the time it came on the table. Butter naan/Garlic naan- were good  Anjeer ka halwa Jalebi and rabdi Shahi tukda All three desserts tasted awesome! But the portion size of each dessert is huge, more than enough for 2-3 people.."

5.0,Nice veg food. Good hospitality. Padamnath was very at table. Food was served nicely and clean. Must try. No issue with parking and service.
4.0,"First things first - the food is very good and the staff is curteous. Lassi, sweets, pindi chana and even the humble roti were all well made and served hot. The starters served as a part of the thali we took were refreshingly different and tasty. What the place lacks is finer details eg. wash room is a floor below! If these smaller things are taken care and they do honor the discount they promise then I highly recommend their thali"
1.0,The service was great. One star for that. Salad was good. Chane had a really funny taste. Funny smell. We returned it. Matar was bland. Kulcha was ok.
5.0,"Wonderful food and service. Great ambience, and a lot of good feel provided in the heart of city. Look forward to many more trips. Cheers to Guru and Ranjan for being wonderful hosts."

5.0,"Excellent food, ambience and service. Large portions, so by the time we were done with starters was almost full. Especial thanks to Guru at the restaurant for making the experience memorable"
4.0,"One of the best North - Indian restaurants in Bangalore.   Food (4/5) : I ordered an unlimited thali available for 750. It was totally worth it. From soup to chaats, from varieties of curry to rice and  a dessert with a choice of lassi/buttermilk.   Ambiance (4/5)  : There is a feel of royalty you will definitely feel there."
5.0,"Very courteous staff, special mention of pineapple raita. Special mention also to Mr. Salman for hospitality and his team with prompt service."

4.0,"Being in Indiranagar with a sudden craving for dal makhani and Gold Privilege on hand, we decided to try out this restaurant. Zomato Gold restaurants being a hit and miss at times, we had our reservations. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The service was really prompt and efficient. The food was delicious. This is one of the best dal makhanis that we have had in Bangalore and considering that we have tried many places in the past few months since moving to Bangalore, that is no easy feat. The plain naan was crispy and well done as requested and the jeera rice cooked to perfection. This is the first time that I have had jeera rice with paneer in it - an interesting combination and something to be noted for both someone who might not like paneer that much and someone who cant get enough. The chutney and chilli achaar accompaniments were equally fantastic. The only thing to be noted is that with many tables being occupied by large groups and/or children and it being a large room, the voices/sounds did get magnified, making it seem noisy. Overall a great experience though."
5.0,Very nice ambience..and awesome starters...a delite for veggie food lover's....guru and Ranjan hospitality was undeniably great.....we will definitely like to visit regularly...
3.0,Ambiance- The ambiance is great and will give you a royal feeling with all those huge couches and chandeliers. Food- The food is good but heavenly expensive. It is now worth the price. The bread/roti here is really expensive and I don't know hat special they do to make it. The restaurant open after 7:00 pm in the evening so do check the timingsbefore going.  I don't think so it was worth the money but if you are a vegetarian and do not care for the expensethen you can give it a shot.
5.0,"Visited this place for dinner and I liked it very much. Talking about the ambiance then it is one of the best place in Indiranagar. Delicious food and place was great. enjoyed food and i felt relax there. It was nice visit,"

5.0,The food was excellent. Have not experiences such fast service and the taste in many such places. The food was light on stomach and remained so. Sultan was excellent at his service and totally valur for money. Don't miss the place!
1.0,"Been in the wish list for quite sometime, made it to here recently for lunch. The place is nicely made with royal and lovely ambiance. Loved the decor and the lighting.  The restaurant is pure vegetarian and tries to bring the authentic taste from Delhi. However, our expectation was beaten up badly. The items that we tried, couldnt give us a strong reason for a comeback again. Tried Dahi Ke Kebab - the taste was quite monotonous and bland. The taste was only that of bland hung curd, with no twist in spices. Naram Dil Kebab & Lahori Kebab were equally not that great.   Chhole Bhature was also quite average. Have had much better Chhole. There were two huge Bhatures, which had a little thicker layer. Had a very strong smell of oil.  What saved the entire experience was the service. The staffs were quite polite, courteous and attentive.  Overall, this was an disappointment."
5.0,Extremely tasty food and service. PadamNath was a very well behaved server. Great service n ambience. Dahi ke kabab is special mention to try. Must visit.

2.0,"Food wasn't great though, all curry were tasted same, it's was very much hyped on zomato with 4+ star.  Booked table in advance still we were put on worst table. When we asked for the free table ( which had reserved on it) they were more like it's reserved. And we were put in table which was just freed by any random customer. The casual dining experience was not great though. Too much hyped in terms of food  And staff was more like, please review it right now give us 5 star. Now I can understand how this places has above 4 star rating.  Thanks"

5.0,"Awesome experience... food was tasty..... We had chur chur naan, pani Puri and lassi. Taste was really very good. Rahman was very polite and friendly"
4.0,"If people considered Interiors while having food. This place has all set it up from it's entrance only. Coming to the food we have ordered. 1.Dahi Seek Kabab - Soft, paneer stuffed Kabab,not spicy at all. Taste's good when consumed hot. 2. Broccoli and Cream soup- It was okay, I felt they have added too much cream, there was no taste of broccoli. 3. Cheese Aloo Tandoori - This was yummy, pocket aloo,topped with cheese. 4. Mini Tandoori Rolls - It had 6 pieces, but trust me it's quite filling and amazing taste. Filled with paneer and capsicum. 5.Choor Choor Nan - The best thing we ordered. The nan is stuffed with paneer and veggies,and served with Chola,Raita and Moong Daal(this was amazing) . The size of the naan is big(picture available), easily shared between 2 people. 6.Veg Pulav - Good quantity of veg Pulav served with Raitha. Amazing ambiance and delightful veg food. Service is very good. Ambiance is amazing. Food- 4/5 Service - 5/5 Ambiance - 4/5 Padam Nath and Sultan did a good job."

5.0,"Good service and Food was amazing, specially the choor choor naan and jalebi rabri and lassi too. Must come and try this place Great service by Padam Nath"
5.0,"Just after seeing the Good reviews & ratings we decided to visit this restaurant. Food was excellent, never in Bangalore I had seen such big chunks of panner for tikkas.  Just have prior booking before visit."
3.0,"Food / Drink - North Indian dishes accompanied by chaas (buttermilk!) / lassi! Best part is that this is a vegetarian restaurant! Cheers to that. Food is flavourful. Delicate and intricate flavours can be tasted. Food seems to be carefully prepared. The rumali roti was very light and fluffy. Paneer lababdar had large paneer chunks. Good portion sizes too. Lassi was too sweet for my liking, and expected a bigger glass for what was charged.  Price - Certainly premium pricing. But a lot is offered. Good food and good ambiance doesnt sufficiently justify the price. Value quotient is sub par compared with other restaurants.  Service - Is plain poor. Long waiting time, which is understandable for a hyped restaurant. But not well managed. We went to the first floor when our turn came, and had no clue what to do! We finally figured out an empty table at a corner and sat. Had to wait considerable time to order. The wait staff just wanted to get done with taking orders. 3:45PM kitchen closes. Dont even bother asking for an extra roti, the tandoor abruptly gets switched off and gets cold. Wish there was better finesse in service to such an upmarket restaurant. Loses major points here.  Ambience - Good. Front fascia is fancy. Large waiting area with limited seating. Elders accompanying? You might just get some stool to sit and wait. Other than that, nothing special. Same usual tables and chairs!  Location - Indiranagar!  Parking - Valet available.  Speciality - Vegetarian North Indian!   Must try? - Are you a vegetarian? Then yes.  Pro tip - Keep expectations low. Be prepared to wait for at least 40 min."
4.0,Good food nice menu Exotic veg dishes Little pricy Must try once Tandoori mini naan Matar naan  Chats are too costly but presentation is good Especially pain Puri
1.0,Okay I hope I could have given 0 star to this place and I still wonder how this restaurant has 4 plus rating because my experience was completely different.  Okay let me start with cons and that is what exactly this restaurant does to the customer. 1. The seating arrangement is so bad for this hotel that in a table of 6 they will ask 2 or 3 people to sit and because of which they won't be able to handle even a small crowd. Hence even if u have a advance Booking for table you have to wait.  2. This place has no parking facilities if you are a bike rider hence think twice that you have to park your bike on the road as restaurant parking will accept only car parking.  3. We sat on our table 9.40 and ordered immediately and we got our food at 10.30 that means even if you order few food items still it will take one hour.  4. Food quality is very bad i.e. taste is absolutely not good neither for main course nor for starters ..only good thing was their starter.  5. Food is extremely over priced as per their food quality.  6. The bill.. which waiter brought to me it has three taxes CGST SGST and SERVICE CHARGE .now if you see they are posing forcefully this service charge even though government rules clearly says no tax should be charged apart from GST but they will post this service charge to ur bill and when I raised this to waiter then after little argument he removed the service charge hence beware of this con activity from hotel.  Conclusion Don't waste ur hard earned money on such a cheat hotel who neither provides quality food neither have proper service nor they do proper billing .
4.0,We really liked our visit. Our server Aman Nath was very polite n helpful. Service was real good and the food was amazing. Definitely will suggest this place to someone.
5.0,"Amazing taste! My grandmother loved the food. We enjoyed the ambience, hygiene, quality and service. staff were very friendly and courteous."
3.0,"The chaat was good. Came at 6 pm so only snacks were available. Kulchas were super soft. The alu tikki wasn't crispy and felt like it had been fried earlier in the day. I think what's missing here is the ambience. I personally love chaat at a street stall, which adds to the flavor and experience. I would visit again for lunch and dinner."
5.0,Best veg food in the town... 3 varieties of paneer tikka... It was awesome Loved the masala buttermilk and dahikebab and tomato soup was just as cooked at home. I would love to visit again n again

5.0,Had a wonderful time at Delhi highway. Awesome food great taste bhagat singh and sultan were very helpful. Try the charcoal mushroom. A place without where food is available without onion and garlic will come again for sure.
5.0,Beautiful ambience and food that justifies the rating. This place is pricey but is perfect to plan a special occasion with family. Yes this restaurant just serves vegetarian and is a veggie's paradise but the others should also give this place a try. This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in the city and is worthy of being in every foodie's checklist. Oh and you are sure to get some lovely clicks for your Instagram.
4.0,Great place good ambience and very friendly staff... Rehman and Sufior was extremely helpful check it out worth visiting authentic delhi food
5.0,My favorite dining place. All the dishes are tasty and well plated. Only suggestion is to have half plate options for starters as the portion size is huge for two people. Rehman the person who served us was exceptionally good and courteous. Loved the service. Definitely will come back :)

5.0,"Great food and service! Loved the experience. Had pani puris and papad churi and Missi roti and Paneer and Chipotle Pasta was lovely!  Thanks, Padamnath and Tak."
1.0,"The staff are super busy as the place is super crowded and are not able to service properly. Big disappointment, had to ask 3 times to get the tissues on paper. Food is also over hyped, many restaurants have much better food. In fact the gravy of malai methi mattar was like pasta sauce. Pathetic it was. Even paneer tikka was quite bland despite asking for making it spicey. They seem to be having 80% stuff prepared in advance to cater to the huge crowd. Ambiance also is v average with too much noise."
5.0,Amazing place. Amazing service by Mr Padam Nath. Very good food. Loved the ambience. Will definitely visit again. Loved the dal sunehri and the following gappa shots. Thank you

5.0,"Service ambience staff is very good. Aloo tikki chat, dahi Bhalla chat had large servings and were filling. The ambience is nice, reminds me of Mughals."
4.0,"Definitely a must visit for spicy north indian food lovers.  Fabulous food:  For a change we found good variety of veg items. We ordered Haryali Mix Veg, Mushroom Do Pyaza and Tandoori Aloo. Every item was precisely cooked and with every bite, we were able to appreciate the speciality they offer in North Indian cuisine.  Service:  They do take care of your special instructions related to food quite well.Though we visited on weekday for dinner but the place was quite vibrant leading to delay in serving. Service is definitely an area of improvement for them."
5.0,Greatly enjoyed the fine dining experience with proper North Indian vegetarian food. Ambience is lovely and staff are very friendly. The Dahi Kabab and Jelebi Rabdi are definitely worth a try.
4.0,"Delhi Highway gives you typical Delhi feels in all the right ways. The ambience transports you to a restaurant in Delhi. The menu has a wide range of options. All vegetarian! The starters pesto mini tandoori rolls and Dahi sheek kabab are worth mentioning.  The biryani was amazing!  And, dont miss out on having Lassi too!  With Zomato gold its quite easy on the pocket as well. But, make sure youve reservation especially on weekends, if not the wait will be too long."
4.0,It was chicken craving Thursday and mistakenly got into this pure veg Delhi highway which claims to be authentic North Indian food. Overall food was good.  LASSI WAS THE HERO. Highly recommended for vegans.

1.0,"Unfortunately, this is the least rating option available on zomato.   We had a terrible time at this place - having gone there with an expectation of having a quite time with family.   1. For one hour full, we were forced to head Happy Birthday to You song in a repeat mode. Upon asking if we can join the birthday party, we were denied :) Once the song got over, same Hero song was played in a loop.   2. We ordered for many dishes - most of them only had one taste - red chillies. Period. The taste begins and ends there.   3. Most of the items from the menu card were not available and we had to literally remember, after talking with steward, what to order versus not.  4. Such a a pathetic preparation that our main course was only 10% finishes after wrapping up and we didnt even feel like doing take away!"
5.0,"This place is genuinely awesome. Do try their Rajma, it's mind blowing. Need to revisit. Thanks for being a gold partner as well. Great place."
5.0,"Has a wonderful experience at this place. Been there on a Saturday evening, had to wait for around 30-40 min for a table for 2. So recommend booking a table in advance to save time as this place is always brimming with customers--an ode to it's beautiful ambience and authentic taste of the food. Very curteous staff. Highly recommended..."
4.0,Lovely food. Had the thali and loved the food. Especially the paneer and kofta curry. Out kids were allowed to choose their choice and they were I. For suprise with the special pav bhaji and planner tikka. Delicious mouth watering paneer.  The only down side for the kids was the masala papad which was filled with green chillies which not only watered their mouth but also their eyes.
5.0,Served by Padam Nath. Very good experience. Very good food. Langarwali dal really stood out. nice ambience. Have a zomato table reservation before hand for an ever smoother experience.

5.0,"Nice restaurant for North india Vegetarian food .Good service and Nice ambience .Padam Nath and Salman were very good at customer service.Will recommend to try Lassi,Makka roti and Langarwali Daal"
1.0,I finally get to taste the food which I was thinking to try from couple of months post reading the reviews. I don't know how this place managed to score such high rating.Either something is wrong with my taste buds or there must be something fictious about the score they have got. Never came across such tasteless food.we ordered malai kofta.they claim to make curry with only cashew and Kishmish which turn out to be entirely wrong. It was made up of curd and chickpea flour and had no taste. Even reported the same to the concerned person but they clearly refused to agree on our complain.other things we ordered were daal makhni and chole. Everything tastes so bland and tasteless that we just simply wanted to rush and leave the place. Would never recommend it to anyone
2.0,Food is no way close to north Indian food.. Too oilyy and service is haphazard with lot of rush... Ordered veg kabbab but they were too spicy and stale.. And PTM was oily as main course.

For starters we ordered pesto tandoori rolls which was surprisingly good and filling...choor choor naan which was ok. Ordered jalebi with rabdi which was sour sweet and crispy. Tased authentic. I would definitely order on zomato from this place as couldnt get to try more dishes. The service was good special thanks to Shankar for taking care of our table orders. All in all, this place is a must try if you stay in and around indiranagar."

4.0,"Being a North Indian i have an endless craving for North Indian dishes and if you have the same do visit Delhi Highway. It's vegetarian for sure but you'll get the taste of North. No compromise on that. The ambiance is great for families also the menu is well curated. We had 2 different types of mock tails (spicy guava and watermelon mohito) 1 chat (dahi bhalla) 1 starter (charcoal mushrooms), butter roti and paneer. The quantity is enough for 3 ppl trust me. I would have given a 5 star rating but then only one con and that is their service is slow. You'll have to call then everytime for everything. Overall: Food 5 star Menu 5 star Ambience 4.5 star Service 4 star  Note: do book in advance for the weekend."

Especially this is only place in bangalore to have a panneer tikka classic at its best, soft and it was very good. If any mushroom lovers wants to try out the mushroom must try the charcoal mushroom. When comes to main course panneer Delhi style which contains combination of panneer mushroom and bhel pepper also nice. Dal sunahri very nice. Rice peas pulav was also nice. And finally we were expecting desserts its jalebi rabdi made from desi ghee. Its worth for money."

2.0,"Delhi highway was on my visit list for long and I visited this place last month when they had Puraani Delhi special menu for morning and evening times. I had quite high hopes from the wordings of menu but the taste was not at all upto the mark even from Bangalore standards of North Indian food, leave apart Puraani Delhi standards.  Ordered Kulcha and Puri dishes and it was less than ok in it's taste. We had gone on a weekend evening and i think the chefs were just tired after hectic lunch time to prepare anything. It seemed like they know it how to prepare but are just not in mood or not bothered at that moment. Order lassi also and it was more than ok.  Could have ordered more things but I was just done after I was initially denied for Zomato Gold incentive. I had to take support of Zomato Gold Customer Service to get it done. I must say Zomato CS was very quick to resolve the issue. The staff was still not bothered and they brought the bill without discount. I had to put the CS chat from Zomato on their face to get it done.  I just hate a place when they don't want to serve just because they had few hectic hours before that. If it's not your piece cake then don't serve it. I am always in search of innovative and new menus and this place disappointed me big time for that.  I am assuming that they have a very good menu for regular lunch and dinner time because of which they are always full on weekends but it doesn't mean that you ignore other menus and staff is not prepared for it when you introduce them. I hope I will be able to change my mind for this place someday."

2.0,The food they offered was not soo mouth watering but that doesn't mean its bad. I took a thali and i feel its not worth the price. Not a great experience. Not pocket friendly. Kesar and badham milk here was at its best. Coming to the ambiance it was cool and rich.
4.0,"Food is great! The soup to start with wasn't that great though! But the starters did definitely keep up the taste buds active. To rate out of five Ambience: 4 / 5 Food: Starters : 4/5, Main course : 4.5/5, Desserts : 5/5 The best dish to try out for is Jilebi with Rabadi. I bet you'll not be ending with just with one plate."

4.0,"With a great ambience, comes great expectations. Delhi Highway does meet the expectations in food to go with its Palace like interior. Although its a pure vegetarian restaurant, it is not at all disappointing. We ordered Corn & Spinach soup with Mozzarella Cheese which was pretty good, a Mushroom Cheese soup which was okay, Masala Papad, an Assorted Roti Basket thats suffice for a group to eat with Paneer Makhni Delhi Style and Daal Makhni that were well flavoured, well cooked and tasty.  Special recommendation : Dahi Kebab which sure is packed with a punch."

4.0,Thanks to Zomato gold for saving my wallet otherwise would have found a big hole in it. Food was pretty good Very pricey for the available ambience and the kind of service
5.0,"They have good varieties of North Indian food. The chat and starters were delicious. One of us could not eat garlic, so the waiter Guru made sure that all the food served on the table is garlic free. Well appreciated. We enjoyed their service, food and ambience."
2.0,I visited with my friend Krishna A. Tripathi today. They accept zomato gold. Ambience is nice there but prices are high as per taste. Not upto the mark. For ambience 5 star. For taste 3 stars and for service 1 star.
5.0,Good food..nice ambience. Excellent location We were looking for a nice place with simple North Indian cuisine and found this... Best choice  for North indian cuisine if you are vegetarian Rehman and sufior are one of the most amazing and courteous servers ever ...
5.0,Shankar was very polite while serving the food. The food and place is good. Perfect place for vegetarian people. Paneer lababdaar and daal makhni are among the best. Th jelebi with rabdi was the perfect end of your meal.
3.0,"First thing first,Ambiance of the place definitely deserves a 5 Star. Rest, we tries chhole bhature and their stuffed Kulchas. Chhole's were good, usual as I've had at other places as well. Bhatura's were also fine, little oily . Kulchas really were looking great and also were soft and the outer layer had that crunchiness which I liked.  I felt the place, except the ambiance was usual. Servings were fancy but in the end taste matters. I feel the price mostly is dominated by the ambiance factor and less by the food factor that's why giving 3 stars.. Else one can and should go enjoy the evening in royalish ambiance. Have zomato gold too like us, to keep budget pocket friendly..:)"
5.0,"Great service by Padam Nath ji, the ambience was good, enjoyed a lot, and yes, last but not the least the food was great. The dal sunhari and malai kofta was too good, reminded me of the way my father used to cook dal ! Great experience overall"

3.0,"Two issues with the order. What was there in the menu was not available so I had to choose something else when the restaurant called me. The garlic nan was very chewy, usually it's pretty good at the restaurant. Rest of the food was yummy. One more gripe is about the zomato app which froze midway and I had to reorder via the browser. PS: I couldn't add the review via the app, so doing it now via the browser - Zomato needs to fix their app issues!!"

3.0,"Service was okay. Padam Nath, Rehman, sufior  was good in his service. The ambience was pretty good as well. Food wasnt great, at least the thali wasnt that good.  Youd expect a lot more from a restaurant thats so full of show and pomp and in the center of 12th main indiranagar which is like the epitome of food culture in Bangalore right now."
5.0,It's a very nice place with a very beautiful ambience. Great food. And Guru was very helpful in choosing our dishes. It would be great if we had an outlet at Hebbal.

5.0,Best place for veg food and good service. Lovely ambience. The mughal setup lights up the theme. One of the best places in Indiranagar to visit with family. Keep up the good work!
2.0,"Ambiance and service deserves a 5 rating. However the food was a real disaster. We went in during the weekday and ordered for their thali. Nothing was good apart from lassi and dahi bhalla Chaat. The soup was very spicy and had no taste apart from the feel of pepper. Golgappa paani was very spicy again. Masala papad tasted nice. The starters were very average. Achaari alu was under done and we could feel the huge uncooked aloo lump in the center. Only the lahori kebab tastes good. Then came the main course. Firstly the thali had a very awful smell. Could be the copper thali. We were served paneer gravy very average, chole below average, gulab jamoon was good, phirni was very runny. The vegetable biryani was average. The raita served had a very bad after taste. It is surely not a place worth revisit."
3.0,Design-3.5/5 Ambiance- 4/5 Cleanliness- 4/5 Value for money-2.5/4 Service delivery-4.5/5 Variety-3/5 Quality of food-2.5/5 Thali was having lots of dishes but the quality was not that much good. As compared to other restaurants like Rajdhani and NH8 it was least.

5.0,"Went to this place to have Delhi food. Though the place serves only veg, the taste is authentic and genuine. We took paneer and butter naan, it was very well made and reminded me of Delhi. Chaats are also good and so are the drinks. Thandai has a very authentic taste, just like north India, although I felt for drinks that the quantity should be more. Martini can be shaken and not stirred but Thandai cant be served like it and needs to be served in a metal glass, full upto the brim. Ambience of the place is also good. Loved the experience. My compliments to the chef and the management."
4.0,Went for lunch.  Located in Indira Nagar this pure vegetarian has a very royal ambience though the furniture is bit jady/down market. Permanent white Patches on the table which we sat made it more low for class of the restaurant.  Nevertheless the menu was very elaborate and we thought we will try the thali. The soup was ok but the starters were superb. The main course was very too good (and too much). Right blend of spices and spiciness made it a very good experience.   The service was brilliant. Get a bit of classiness in the ambience to make it a wholesome WOW place to dine
5.0,Nice ambience..and excellent service by Mr.Padamnath. Would definitely come back again.!!  Thank for giving great service. We loved a lot. Would

5.0,"Awesome North Indian food.we have tried many foods and all are awesome and services are good.Thanks to rahman,sufior.if you guys really want to eat delhi food plz go ahead."
5.0,Food is really good at this place along with the ambience. Our server Bhagat Singh really helped to get everything as soon as possible. Awesome service. Rabdi Jalebi is a must try.
4.0,To start with I am not a Veg lover.. Accidentally I visited the place with a Vegan friend and to my surprise the decors were astounding... the food was lovely with every bit of the food tasting authentic. The starters were brilliant and we tasted dahi ke kebab which were marvellous.. keep up the good work guys.
4.0,"It is almost a heaven for a foodie. The ambiance is amazing. The food is delicious. We went there on 1st Jan and they had a New Year special thali. Which started with a welcome drink virgin sangria, which is good but not great. After that you get shorba, which is delicious. Then you are served Pani Puri shots, which were amazing. Then you are served dahi papdi chaat, which is proper North Indian dahi papdi chaat and very very delicious. Then you are served Tandoori platter as starters, it contains paneer tikka, tandoori potato, hara bhara kabab, dahi k kabab, malai chaap, etc. The platter is mouth watering and very delicious. And you can repeat any of the starters. After that comes main course which is Maharaja Thali. This thali has 5 type of gravies such as Shahi paneer, Pindi chhole, mix veg, daal makhani and matar-chhole. Also it has Hyderabadi Biryani and raita. And you can have as many breads as you want. All the gravies are mouth-watering and delicious. You must take your time to have it all. Then comes the desert. They served jalebi-rabdi, gajar ka halwa. Deserts is the one thing they need to work on. That's the only reason for 4-star in my review. And then comes kulhad-lassi. Lassi also is not great but ok ok. But in all it was worth the money we value for money. Note: I would recommend to book the table prior, because we had to wait for 45 minutes. It may be because of new year's day, but still I would recommend reservation."
5.0,"Friendly staff guru and sultan , good food and Ambience. Can try atleast once. Made our new year special. It was good experience to be here.."
4.0,The ambience of the place gives a little royal feel. The food is good but over spicy for people like us who eat less spicy food. The service is good but staff is not so courteous. Overall a good place for North Indian Veg food but not out of the world
5.0,"Visited this place cause we were craving chaat. Very good ambience. Had the Bhalla chaat and Aloo tiki chaat. Loved the Bhalla chaat, delicious flavour and variety of sauces. Aloo Tikku chaat was also good, but more on the spicy side. Would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu."
4.0,"Another feather in the cap for Indiranagar.Lovely ambiance and very attentive and personal service provided here. Food was tasty and well served. Liked the quality and quantity. We ordered Masala Soda and Paneer Tikka for starters. Followed by Dal Makhani and Tandoori Roti.Do visit the place for some soul satisfying food. My next visit will be to try their Thali, which looked very tempting !"
5.0,"Paneer Lahori and chat platter was awesome, good food, good service n great ambiance, they had instant service and served promptly by Padam Nath, Saidul n Chandmiza"

5.0,"Absolutely amazing food and service. Total 5 stars here. Special call out to Rehman! Awesome stuff, guys! Please do keep up the good service"
5.0,Went to this place for dinner with family. Ordered paneer lababdar with breads and naram Dil kabab. Both dishes were really good. Server Rehman was also very nice and polite. The overall experience was really good
3.0,"Nothing exceptional about the food, very poor and delayed service. We spent more time waiting than eating (we were eating their supposed Maharaja Thali)."
2.0,"First off, an amazing mughlai kind of setup makes the ambience highly appealing, especially in the night time. I loved the minimalist patterned paintwork on the walls and the use of wooden carved jalis separating every table from the other. Not many restaurants respect privacy but this place had it covered. We had the special thali on the weekday and the prices seemed worth it for what was on offer. The quantities were little, just perfect and to ensure that wastage remained minimal. The chaats, starters and welcome drink were good. However, the starters could have been warmer and the paneer more cooked. The daal and curd were stale as there was some form of odour emanating from the two. We raised the concern with the waiters who patiently heard us out, brought it to the notice of the chef and got us the replacements. The replacements, alas were just warmer than their predecessors. The food coming in the thali was cold in general and there could have been some more work done to ensure a better dining experience. Staff was courteous and the ambience was beautiful."
5.0,Very authentic Delhi style chaat plus very delicious Dum biryani should be treat for veg ppl.... Rehaman ji tho lajawb service karte hai. Aur sufior ka service bi lajawb hai.

5.0,Good portion size. Amazing and hot food. The service was quick and good. We will definitely visit again. Will definitely recommend this for veg food lovers.
4.0,Been there for a lunch with colleagues. Place has a really good ambience. Staff are very polite. We taken care in a very nice way by Padam Nath. Food is of good quality. Tandoori potato starter was very good. It's a pure vegetarian restaurant. Zomato gold is also accepted here on food.
3.0,"Visited this place for lunch. They had two options. A set menu spread that had huge list of items and ala carte as well. Started off with the tomato shorba and it was a very light soup. Good at times but bland for the majority of the time. The spread was good with things like chole, daal, paneer etc. The paneer starter lacked salt. The kulcha served with the meal was full of butter and they didn't ask me a choice. So I asked them to change it but that received no response. Eventually the meal ended with lassi which was supposed to be sweet but it was sour at best. I asked them to change it and post a lot of wait they served the same tasting lassi again.  They have a valet option and have a old Delhi kind of decor. Spacious with decent staff.  When I step into a place on 12th main, I come with a lot of expectations. Maybe thats where this place fell a bit short with respect to the food and responsiveness of the staff."
1.0,I felt it ti be quite overpriced and food also not that bizzarely great as compared to the price. There is also some scope for improvement in their service.
4.0,"Winters are here! And one of the things I really enjoy is a good thaali with some good pickle! Delhi highway is the place for it for me. Perfect thaali and amazing pickles to accompany it with. Delicious channa, black daal , bhindi , pulao, mix vegetables, Gulab jamoon , curd and jalebi. So fulfilling that one could go into hibernation after the meal . ."

5.0,Delhi highway is the road to best North Indian food in Bangalore. This all vegetarian place with super quick service has a lot to offer which will solve your North Indian cravings in an instant. Try the choor choor naan and pair it with the thick lassi or go for the parantha combo which comes with creamy dal makhni and chole. We were provided great service by Rehman and others. Would visit again and recommend it to other people.
5.0,We had a good time with family at Delhi Highway restaurant. And the portion shared on all the dishes were more than sufficient and tasty as well.

1.0,"One of the most overhyped places I have ever visited in my life... The service was so poor right from the reception to the billing activity... We were never greeted by anyone and in spite of asking the recommendation on food, we didn't get any suggestions or help...  Poor us, on the basis of our other North Indian experiences decided to order chola bhatura and daal choorma.. greatest disappointment to us...  Chole tasted so bad as if the kitchen was being run by someone completely unrelated to cooking... Bhature had sour taste, were flooded with oil and served cold..  We were not offered any tissues to get the oil absored, unfortunately we could not eat the dish...  Next item was daal choorma which tasted well but the quantity served was too less...  Both the above dishes were 395 each... Which is insanely overpriced and the poor quality doesn't make it worth even 50 bucks...  Onion served as salad again was cut so badly and looked completely unfresh...  Drinks we ordered were a guava chilli cocktail and special lassi which tasted decent...  When complained about the food, no one came to attend us, instead we were just presented with the bill...  I would never recommend this place to anyone... This experience definitely tops my worst dinner..."

The ambience is extremely beautiful - it's done up like a palace. We tried their gol gappas which came with 6 shot-like glasses of different water and juice combos! It was fun to try them all, but the gol gappas could've been made better, as some of them were leaky. We also tried the Bhalla papdi chaat, which was very good. Would like to come back and try out their meals for sure."

4.0,We went for family lunch on sunday with friends. Food was good especially the starter and Paneer lababdar. Chur mur naan was a dish on its own and is sufficient for 1 person it comes with its own set of veg and daal. Matar kucha was a total disappointing with the kucha being readymade and matar being tasteless. The service started pretty good but went downhill from there. Quantity was ok. The naan were 3 piece.

We ordered dahi Bhalla ,makkai ka starters,ragda pattice,panneer assorted platter, spicy guava juice, lassi,small kukche stuffed with cheese and salsa sauce types as sides. The langar dal was amazing and so was the rabdi jilebi.  Overall an amazing experience and really touched the north flavours. A must go atleast once. Better to reserve."

5.0,"A pure vegetarian fine dine north indian restaurant located in the heart of Indiranagar is one of the finest available in the surroundings.  Since there are not many pure veg. restaurants this is definitely a plus for all the people residing there. I recently tried their new breakfast and snack menu which was outstanding! I got to try the authentic delhi street food dishes which was quite new and it was totally worth it.  Their new menu consisted of chaats, bature, parathas, beverages and desserts.  Initially in chaats I tried  - Dahi Bhalla papadi chaat (Must try) - Pani puri shots - Suke aloo ki chaat  - Chole Samosa (Must try) - Paneer bread pakoda  Chaats tasted authentic and the presentation was good too! In Dahi Bhalla papadi chaat , Dahi was on the sweeter side which i personally find it to be much tastier. Chole was really fresh and delicious with the crisp and loaded samosas. Paneer pakoda was soft and very hot! Goes well with the mint chutney  Also amritsari lassi with almonds is a must have here which complements well with the spicy chaats.  They also have poori that is served with aloo and pumpkin gravies with raitha, kulcha chole - Delhi's famous spicy Chole served with bread Kulcha and pickle along with boiled masala potatoes. These two dishes were also very delicious and a must try   In deserts Jalebi Rabdi was outstanding! Crispy hot thin Jalebis with rabdi is the best combo.  Experience in Delhi highway was truly amazing and would look forward to visit this place and try their main course as well.   Ambiance - 4.5/5 Quality - 4.5/5 Quantity - 5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Price  - 4.5/5"
2.0,Tried their chole kulche for lunch. The taste was absolutely bland and they charged a lot for the same. Could get better chole kulche at a roadside stall. Highly disappointing. The place didn't live upto its name.
4.0,"I wish there was a 4.5 rating on zomato because this place deserves it. They also served an extra bowl of chips for all tables and it was very tasty too! So browny points ;) Ambience: Looks small from outside but pretty crowded place. Make sure you book a table before visiting the place specifically on weekends. Ambience: 4/5 Taste: We ordered the kala khatta mocktail which was amazing, Dahi papdi chat which was the best I have had till date and definitely is a must try, makai kebab which was good too. The subzi we ordered was veg karahi which was decent. Taste: 5/5 Price:Little overpriced for the quantity of food served, the subzi was very less in quantity. Price: 4/5"

We walked in without reservations and were told that it will take 50mnts to get a table! There were 20 odd ppl waiting in their lobby. Surprisingly, got a call in 10mnts and we got our table. Its a veg only place- we ordered Dahi ke kebabs, veg sheekh, Kali daal, rotis, 2 mocktails and moong daal halwa! Daal and veg sheekh could have been better, rest were great. Service was ok, they were packed! The ambience is nice- lot of mughal style decoration. Because of my delhi crowd the place is really noisy ."

4.0,"Rating - 4.5  Located on a prime location of the 12th main road of Indiranagar, Delhi Highway is one of the most royal, fine-dine, North-Indian, vegetarian restaurant you are going to come across in Bangalore.  I visited this place with few of my friends on a Saturday evening to try out their newly launched breakfast and snacks menu.  They have included a large variety of dishes which consists of parathas, chaats and what not. Some of the dishes that we had were halwa Nagori with puri, bedmi puri served with potato and pumpkin curry served separately, kulche with chole and matar and the highlights were chola samosa and dahi Bhalla papdi chaat. Though I am not a big fan of bread pakodas but the paneer bread pakodas served by them were really scrumptious.  We also had the Amritsari lassi with almonds and rabdi jalebi which was delicious. The thing that is going to attract you here is how they served most of the items in a plate with the paan leaves at the base.  Do visit this place and give their new breakfast and snacks menu a try and tell me what all you liked."
5.0,Very good authentic food. Very friendly staff and attentive too. I had the thali which was a tad expensive but all the items tasted very good. The ambience is also very good.

1.0,"I was looking for a decent pure vegetarian restaurant in indirangar and chose this place. I saw the reviews and ratings before arriving this place and was having an expectation.  This place is OVER HYPED. The most probable reason is there are not many pure veg. Restaurants for family dinings. Probably this is more for the upper middle class types who really dont care what is sitting on their plates untill its looking good.  Let me justify: #1. Tomato soup with basil leaves: after repeatedly telling them to cut down spice, they gave us mexican chilly tasting soup.. sorry RASAM!  #2. Roasted Potato cheese: Kindly take this item OFF from the list. Its an insult to the farmer and his efforts in getting those potatos for you. Pathetic! They took few baby potatoes and applied a lot of red color on it with little souce, which was with no taste at all. The actual cost of this item might be 35 or 400 but was sold for 280! Im not exaggerating guys. This was pathetic.  #3: Panner Butter Masala: after begging them to serve us non spicy food, we chose this and was good. I'll rate this 3.5/5  #4. Roti: I liked them. This was the only item which i liked. They were soft and usual as you get anywhere else.  My overall experience for this place was bad and wouldn't suggest for someone who is looking for a tasty food. Yes, if you are my north indian friend and would like to take your grandparents or parents who came to see you. But still, i would say indiranagar is a home for exceptionally good food.  BTW, forgot to mention. I and my friend had to sit with dry palms waiting for the finger bowl. Everytime we asked, the serving guy said its almost there. I was pissed and went on searching for the handwash area and didnt find it in the 1st floor. I came down and went to the mens room to wash my hands.  PS:Dont get deceived by the pics. They added a lot of color so that you dont have to search any filter in Instagram."
3.0,"One of the exclusive veg.restaurant in the Indiranagar neighborhood. Maintains the authenticity of it's name, by bringing in the decor and flavours which reflects the richness of Delhi. Food is good overall however not jawdroppingly good. Some of the items kulcha , dal makhni holds up for good. Chats were a little disappointing. The thalis were a bit over priced for vegetarian food."

4.0,"Food :5/5 Ambience :4/5 Staff:4/5  The place is located in Indiranagar and is a really calm area , it is a pure vegetarian restaurant with authentic cusine's from the north , Their new snack menu is really interesting and I loved each and every dish they have in their snacks menu.  From the chaats : Aloo tikki chaat Dahi Bhalla Papdi chaat Papdi chaat  All of these were different and rich in taste , ingredients were perfect and I hogged them thoroughly ,  From the maincourse section : Bedmi puri and sabzis Chole samosa Chole kulche paneer bread pakoras  The Bedmi puris came with some delicious sabzis presented in traditional cutlery like how they serve it roadside , puris and sabzis were great Chole samosa being my favourite since childhood didn't disappoint me here with the samosa stuffing delicious. Chole kulche was succulent with soft kulchas served hot and is worth a try. Paneer bread pakoras were nice , the bread were soft which i liked with paneer stuffing better, would recommend to try this.  Desserts: jalebi and rabri: Had the best time when I dipped rabri on jalebi , the taste was spectacular and would love to come here again just for this dish."
3.0,"Really liked the restaurant. Beautiful ambience of this restaurant, restaurant is spread out. Many seating options are there. Food was okay, not upto the mark.

They need to work on there staff."

4.0,"Located in indiranagar, this is a must visit place for all north indian food lovers. The restaurant has kind of royal theme which looks great and is good for clicking pictures too. The food is absolutely amazing. We ordered masala papad and classic paneer tikka for starters. Paneer tikka was served with green chutney and onion, capsicum on the side. It was flavour full and tasty. Whereas the masala papad was way too spicy with a lot of green chillies and lacked in flavour. For main course we ordered lahori paneer and butter roti. It had a very different tangy flavor that I couldn't quite place. But it was delicious. Other than that, the service was really good. The menu has a lot of variety and I couldn't eat a lot of stuff on my visit there. But I would definitely like to visit again and try rest of their dishes."
2.0,Nothing great about the food. They have a grand ambience but wish the food could match it. Untrained staff. I found the place overrated and over priced. Not worth it
4.0,"Wanted to try this place for the longest time. Finally got a chance to. The ambience is good but do ask for a table on the upper sitting area. The downstairs one can get a little loud if there are too many people. We were served by Rahman and he was very polite and prompt with the service. We opted for some Delhi street specials like aloo chaat, matar Kulcha and they tasted just like they do in the streets of Delhi. Other than that we also took some dahi seekh kababs, a tandoori version of the dahi kababs, they were soft and melted in our mouths; Chur Chur naan which was also pretty good. To top it off some jalebi with rabdi, which was the best I've tasted so far in Bangalore!"

2.0,"Earlier this place was the only hope I had for the best authentic north Indian food served in Bangalore, especially a good vegetarian restaurant. My options would be number 1 always. Sooner and later had frequently visited in Chennai and Bangalore branches, the quality of the food has dropped off drastically, don't understand why so, it is only the paneer starters are kind of ok and good sometimes, else other than that and the ambience nothing great. Moreover it is priced too high. The Service is also so so and not like how it was seen in the initial days sometime recalling back before a year or two. You can pay a visit if you love or want to try some paneer platter and some starters, hoping atleast they would improve the food quality in the coming days , else can be avoided and save some good amount of money."
5.0,"Aweosme food. Great ambience. Extremely friendly service by Padma Nath. Shahi tukda, paneer lababdaar and paneer Tikka are a must try if you're here..."
4.0,"Delhi hightway is on the 13th main road, Indiranagar. A beautiful place that will definitely catch your eye. They serve authentic north Indian food(veg only) and have started their new snacks menu. Here is what I tried  Papdi dahi balla: true to its name we had an amazing street food. Papdi topped with balla, curd, sweet and tangy sauce was my fav. Must try  Pani puri: two sweet pani's, 2 spicy pani's, 1mango flavoured and finally a cranberry flavoured pani; all topped with a crunchy puri and stuffing, was a creative dish.  Sweet lassi: thick sweet curd topped with almonds was an amazing drink. Must try  Chole kulcha: soft yummy kulcha,flavourful chole and yummy pickled side. Loved it. Must try  Chole bhautre: puris along with a sweet pumpkin curry, chole curry and a boondi raita was good overall dish  Halwa puri: semolina based halwa with a puri. A classic north Indian breakfast. Must try.  Jelebi and rabdi: a classic combination for the sweet tooth foodie was a perfect balance of crunch, sweet, and cream. Must try"

1.0,Generally we refer to the reviews and ratings on Zomato before dining out and we did the same when we visited today to Delhi Highway. We ordered for Maharaja Thali as we thought the spread was nice. The starters were ok but definitely below expectations and then we waited for the main course. The main course was a big disappointment and we compared it with a normal Darshani North Indian Thali. The biggest disappointment was the special Delhi lassi which was so sour that we had to call the manager and explain him the problem. He said someone has offered you Dahi instead of lassi. After 20 min we were given the lassi which was nothing but the same sour curd mixed with lot of sugar !! Avoid this place if possible
3.0,"Nice ambience but the service is too slow. Quantity is justified for the price. Taste doesnt seem so great, it can be rated average. We tried cheese aloo balls and it is pretty descent. Methi malai matars taste can be improved a bit."

For Food : We ordered peshawari kabab which was ok . In main course we ordered paneer Lahori , butter roti , jeera rice along with one combo of Chur -Chur Naan .Paneer Lahori was very average and Chur Chur naan was not crispy at all. Food was very average . It was waste of money . The best part of restaurants was it vellet service for car parking . The guy who parked our car was very honest and we had forgotten our phone in car and he brought it back . Thanks for it ."

The paneer was extremely soft and well cooked. For beverages we ordered Mumbai Masakkali, which was a little spicy, and Kala khatta mojito which I personally loved a lot because it brought back the nostalgic memories of childhood. For desserts we got gulabjamun which was good as well. The place is slightly heavy on the pocket, but with zomato gold it felt better! We got excellent service by Sultaan, who ensured we got our order on time."
1.0,Had placed an online order for certain snacks items from this place . Post confirmation of order from the restaurants side I got a call from the manager saying they can't process the same . Not sure why did they approve the order and then asked me to cancel the same.
4.0,"Fine dining restaurant where u can visit with your family as they have like pure delhi style menu, u doent have to worry about your parents or grandparents if they will like the food or not. It is a pure veg restaurant also jain friendly, like they have rich menu without garlic and onion also. Ambience is peaceful and bright. Service is good, even the staff was wearing kurtas . only thing is it will burn a hole in your pocket. i can hardly see anything for less than 250/- to 300/- except breads and sides."
5.0,Pure Vegetarian restaurant with authentic north Indian flavour. Liked the ambience and food. Cost wise little on higher side but taste wise it doesn't disappoint.
5.0,Food was really good. The taste texture everything was perfect. The ambiance of the place is okay.. The review is only for the food.. The desert rabdi jilebi is a must try

5.0,"Really beautiful place and amazing food. Had spicy guava juice, it tickled my taste buds. Dahi ke kabab is a must have. Paneer lababdar was really soft and tender. A must visit place."
5.0,"Hi guys, came to this place on a weekend for a family dinner, nice looking place. Tried a variety of starters, personal favourite naram dil kebab. Should really try the amazing variety of starters here. Our guy Rehman made sure he didnt keep the clock ticking long enough to stop our taste buds from sensing"
4.0,"Authentic Delhi food experience with good service. Especially enjoyed the chaats on offer. Had also ordered Chole bhatura, Chur chur naan & Dum biryani which were tasty and filling. Finally the desserts (Shahi tukda & Moong dal halwa) which are large portions, luckily we ordered only 2 which was sufficient for 4 people.  The only downside is that the place is a bit noisy & smoky (when people around you order too many sizzlers), but not enough to stop me from visiting again or recommending it to my friends.  Special mention to the service staff who are very friendly and attentive to your needs."
4.0,Nice place. Tried chaat gadhi and sirke wala pyaaz. Can visit for good north indian food. Near Chianti and plan b on 100 ft road. Zomato gold applicable so price was reasonable.
5.0,"Great food. Good staff. Two small complaints - onions served were bad and on complaining, we got served bad onions again. Got it right the third time. And the napkins were dirty."
5.0,We had a great lunch at Delhi Highway. The Choor Choor naan was especially tasty. Padamnath served us really courteously. Would highly recommend the place for a great North Indian veg food experience:-)
5.0,"Very good staff with amazing ambiance. Must try. We had the paneer tikka, rolls, papad and proper main course. Authentic Indian taste with a twist of fusion! Must try."
4.0,Overwhelmed by taste of food..service is also good..will surely come next tym God interior..pleasant also..butvsongs which are played are boring
5.0,"Amazing food and service. Proper North Indian themed ambience. We ordered a starter, dal and a paneer dish. The breads were crispy and well seasoned. The starter had an amazing texture to it and the paneer melted in the mouth. The paneer was delicious and the grave felt authentic. The dal had a rich flavour. One of the best North Indian food places in Bangalore. Sultan was an amazing server and helped us graciously."
5.0,"Ambience is good and service by padam nath is nice. Mushroom hara pyaja, paneer tikka was prepared good.  Dahi ke kabab, triple orange and apple mozito was good."
5.0,"Padam nath gave a brilliant service. Kudos to the food. Had naan, aloo, dal sunehri and salad. Overall service is brilliant and the ambience is great!"
4.0,"A pure vegetarian restaurant. Proper Delhi style food. It was a special occasion and we visited this place just for a difference. We opted thali, started of with a drink which was good. Food quality is very good. This restaurant does not suit for people who love spicy food. Most of the items served are mild and sweet in taste. I liked chat item and dessert the most. Overall a decent experience. But, the cost is definitely on a higher note. We are getting many more buffet options for lesser price."
5.0,"Diwali Night Dinner  This inside of it looks like a Mahal. Elegance is one of the key features of this amazing restaurant.  Lets get started. We ordered the Diwali special thali as it had tons of things to try in it. The meal started with an orange blast(welcome drink). The next thing was tomoato shorba (soup) which was flavourful and a bit spicy. Then Masala papad, very beautifully presented as like a cone and the fillings inside followed by palak patte chaat and gol gappe which were decent enough. Then we received an plate full of assorted starters: 1. Five mirchi Paneer Tikka 2. Naram dil Kebab 3. Cheese Aloo Tandoori 4.Lahori Kebab 5. Dahi seekh Kebab 6. Corn Aloo Tikki.  They didn't rush at all so we had ample amount of time to savour each and every bit of the starters which were offered.  Meanwhile we had ordered something else from the menu. 1. Charcoal Mushroom: Mushrooms stuffed with cottage cheese in between and grilled. It had a nice smokey taste not very different from the paneek tikka as the base of spices were the same and the quantity was also good. 2. Chipotle Mushroom: This is the best thing that I had there. Mushrooms in Chipotle sauce with green and black olives, cherry tomatoes and jalapenos. Wow! I loved this dish.  Come back to our thali. We were served the main course in a different thali with all different sabzis all around inside the plate in small bowls accompanied with assorted breads( tandoori rooti and butter naan). The other main course were 1. Dal Makhani 2. Sirka Pyaaz Paneer 3.Pindi Chana 4. Aloo matar 5. Navaratna Korma 6 Dum biryani. We were even served desserts. 1.Kesariya kheer 2. Jalebi Rabdi 3. Sweet Lassi.  Out of all these I enjoyed Sirka Pyaaz Paneer, Pindi Chana, Dum biryani. The jalebi rabdi was very very sweet. They could have made a better balance. I like the Kesariya kheer. It was less sweet with lovely taste of kesar. I had this twice.  I would like to mention our host, Guru, who was very humble and polite. Thank you."
5.0,If you want to try good food with amazing service and ambience you should visit this place once . Padam nath sultan was our server for the day and he did an amazing job serving us with the amazing dishes and on time sevices
5.0,I enjoyed the service. I felt the food taste different than rest of the north indian restaurant. It was certainly one of the best punjabi food i ever had in Bangalore
2.0,Was spicy despite providing instructions ...
4.0,Such an amazing ambience. Felt that amazing silence and peace while eating. I went with the thali which had some amazing options and flavours. The Pani Puri was amazing the sour flavorful of the water just amazing. The chats were a great start. Coming to the main course. All the curries were descent but what stood out for me was the kofta and paneer. The BIRIYANI tasted amazing. The flavours in it were great. They ended it with a glass of lassi which was too sweet for me. The service was great and pricing not very expensive. Would love to come back again for such great flavours.  Food - 4/5 Service - 4.2/5 Ambience - 3.8/5 Pricing - 3.5/5 Overall experience - 4.1/5
3.0,"Loved the service by Mr. Padam. The food was not too bad, but wasn't the greatest, to be honest. Please give the Missi roti a miss. The rest of the food was decent though."
5.0,Had an awesome experience here..Just great food with awesome hospitality. Must visit for great North Indian food. Service by Padam Nath was really good.
3.0,Visited during diwali.a good vegetarian restaurant. Dal makhani n veg kebabs are really good. Had thali which was a combination of many dishes. Veg Biryani was amazing. Chaat was also nice. Rajma was not good at all. Kheer was not good. Rest items were okay.
3.0,Ambience - 4/5 Food - 3/5  Service - 3.5/5    Well the hospitality was a lill dull in the beginning.   The person taking order knew his way around the menu   cosy dining area   no alcohol served   Very expensive and food not the worth   Food   - veg pulao
3.0,"Been here for a lunch around 2. It was heavily crowded. Even though I reserved the table, hotel made me wait for half an hr to get me a table. Ambience is very good. Seating arrangements and sofas are very comfortable. Coming to food, we took buffet. Welcome drink was avg, Starters were very good, Tandoori aloo, Kababs, Dahi Papadi Chat were the showstoppers. Main course came in a Thali. It was average. I didn't find it great. Most of them were less spicy and lacking salt. Moong Dal halwa and Jilebi were delicious. Overall food is average for the price you pay. I felt restaurant more on the expensive side for what they offer. Service was very slow. Had to ask more than 5-6 times to bring the next course which was really annoying..."
3.0,"We were actually surprised that it was a vegetarian restaurant. I was dreaming of Butter chicken and Romali when I saw the name.   Anyway, the place looked huge but was very crowded. On a Sunday night, had to wait nearly 45 mins to get seated. The service was kind of slow(maybe due to the crowd).   The food was good. All dishes were a handful. I find very few restaurants who serve a-little-more-than-required food quantity.   The lassi was amazing!  Overall, a good family restaurant that wouldnt disappoint you!  Ps: Unless you thought it was a Non-veg hotel, like me."
5.0,I get north indian taste only at delhi highway in Bangalore. Not only food but service have always been good. We ordered Dal & Paneer do Pyaza and is satisfied as got what we expected.

5.0,"Visited For lunch, got really good suggestions from mr Padam Nath and had a chur chur Naan combo, and dum biryani. Ambience and service both were up to mark. Cleanliness was maintained. Worth a visit!"
4.0,"It was a great experience being here for dinner feeling all lavish and ""khandani"" because of the beautiful interiors straight from some palace in the 1900s, only with much better facilities! I ordered the Dal Delhi highway. It's served in a bucket, legit and just adds to the authenticity of the ambience. The seasoning was slightly on the lower side, but it's okay to an extent because you can always add some salt but not lessen it from a dish! Only that, maybe it would be slightly more appealing with some garnish on it. Maybe some coriander, because our olfactory senses certainly get triggered by the way the food looks. Next was, the paneer Delhi style - perfectly balanced spices, freshly cut cubes of cottage cheese, ideally soft and soaked in rich ""Dilliwali gravy!"" Yum. Coming to the Hyderabadi Biryani, you expect it to be spicy and I wasn't even in the least disappointed. I'd give a 9/10 to the food. The only reason why I wouldn't give this place a 5 star is the fact that I'd asked for water and a waiter just walked off and served water at the next table despite us asking for it before! I mean, I understand there was a lot of rush as we had to wait for 15minutes to get a table but it was a totally unacceptable behaviour to not serve water when requested. Also, the glasses weren't polished up to the mark. If you're giving us copper plated utensils, might as well just make sure they're worth the show! On another note, it's okay to be asking a guest to write a review but NOT repeatedly ask to do the same when we've already said that we'd post a review. It was forcible of Mr Shankar to be asking to put down a review then and there. Nonetheless, I'd love to be back here."
5.0,Nice ambience and great service by Padam nath & shankar Mashroom starter was good and paneer lababdar was amazing Butter milk was with proper seasoning n great taste Must visit place

This place offers a complete package that is from Thoughtful interiors to perfect service and food to elate your taste buds."
3.0,We went to this place looking for an authentic North Indian restaurant and by the Zomato rating and reviews. The ambience was pretty decent. We ordered a starter which was tasty. We also ordered chole Batura  in which the Batura was burnt and had a bitter taste. Was very disappointed with this. Might not visit this place again as there are way too many restaurants which can get the basic chole Batura right!
4.0,Beautiful ambience .. and amazing food. Great hospitality specially by Rehman. Authentic North Indian food specially the Dal. Shahi Tukda was the icing on the cake :) Strongly recommended!!!
4.0,"We were able to get a table confirmation within minutes on a busy Friday evening. The ambience was is above average with interiors resembling Mughal darbaars complete with heavy chandeliers. On the food front, we ordered Dahi k kabaab, chole-bhatoore, veg kadahi, paneer tikka-masala and Butter rotis. Star of the show were DKK and CB as it was closest you can get to authentic delhi taste. The only missing ingredients was the bhoone aaloo and carrot pickle that is served with CB in every delhi bylanes. When you claim authentic delhi taste, you have to live upto these details.  Main course was good (nothing great). They have a hige variety so i will probably need another visit to write about those but basis what is tasted, i will definitely like to come again."

5.0,"Today was my second time visit to delhi highway with my office staff for team lunch. It's complitly north Indian veg restaurant. Which ambiance is mughala palace. Nice oh Interior with golden and white background. We tried special lunch Thali .. Which included welcom drinks, soup, chat, starter, main course and dessert.. And end of the meal one sweet lassi.. Food was very nice.. Great service .. Staff were courtesy.."
1.0,"Went yesterday for dinner to the restaurant hearing about the hype regarding the food and decor of the place. But turns out the only good part was the Decor not the food. Ordered Dahi sheek kebab, Lahori Kebab and Raj Kachori Chaat for starter and the Dahi sheek was blunt and gooey inside and the Lahori kebab had the only taste of chilli (Damm spicy and other than the spice got no other taste at all). The Raj Kachori Chaat was good among all the dishes we ordered. Then for the main course we ordered Mix Veg and Langar wali Dal along with Lacha Paratha and Tandoori Roti. The mix veg had no taste as such and was under cooked and the veggies were staring back at you and the Dal was just like boiled and tossed in the pan with some water and little species and then topped with Ghee/Dalda and served with no salt in it or nothing. The Tandoori rotis were cooked properly but the Lacha paratha was very much under cooked and was raw from inside. We literally had to take bits and pieces of the Lacha paratha and eat and throw the rest. For the beverage we did order Lassi which was the 2nd best among all the dishes we ordered."
1.0,"Bigger the name worse the taste, there was nothing good in taste there except raj kachori which wasn't worth 275 rs. The interior is really good but the food isn't good at all Total waste of money!"
5.0,The ambience is really good; the food is great as well; although the buffet could have a little more options. I also feel there should be more variety of dessert.
5.0,"Place gives you Royal feelings. Ambience great, food yummy, and the soft songs are add-ons. It's worth giving many try. Good luck Thanks to #spadamnath for giving friendly touch."
5.0,Food was really good and staff was really courteous. Must visit for all vegetarians. Naram dil kabab started was amazing. Overall a good experience
1.0,Food wasnt tasty. We ordered 3 dishes and they forgot 2 of the dishes and we had to remind them each time.  Eating the greasy mini kulchas with the oily chutney made me wish I had starved. I had a say a quick prayer during my meal asking the higher ups for forgiveness and that I had learnt my lesson because of the punishment that was being dished out.  Id wish this food on my worst enemy.

We were attended by guru very nice person and the service  was real fast and the food was awesome we had naram dil kabab for starters; Maincourse we tried baby kulcha and the Delhi style paneer(the paneer was succulent) I having this type of food after a long .overall it was a great experience.

5.0,DELHI HIGHWAY is such a awesome place to visit. I have been served by Padam nath. The guy is humble and get the order quickly. I really had good time here with my friend. #food #awesomeness #mustvisit #bangalorediries
5.0,"Excellent service, great ambience..very hospitable and friendly staff. We ate pav bhaji with garlic bun and dahi seekh kebab. Both were delightful and sumptutuous. Must visit"
5.0,Food is really awesome. Padam Nath treated us really very well. Nice service. Baby Kulcha is really very yummy and delicious. Ordered Narain dil kabab too.. this again is a star dish.
2.0,"Had rajkachori,naram kabab and chole chawal. Apart from rajkachori and the service everything was really bad. The chole were having a very bad smell. We have to waste most of our food as it was not at all edible. Went there with so much expectations, all in vain."
5.0,"Polite staff, great food. Had their kulcha which could have used a little bit more salt but was perfect otherwise. The portions were sizeable and we couldn't finish it inspite of being ravenous."
4.0,Staff was polite.. And friendly... Food was delicious... Chipotle Mushroom that we ordered was spicy.. But definitely worth a try... Padamnath and sultan were very courteous and explained the dishes very nicely... Worth a try to this place
1.0,I have dined in their branch in Chennai..to compare the food taste between both places is a sin.the restaurant delayed the food delivery by 1 hour.i was hungry but its okay.i ordered the food box and it was sorely disappointing is an understatement.i would review the items one by one. 2 starters-the paneer starter has so much colour powder that I would call it a bloody massacre and the other starter was okay Biryani-the worst I had tasted.all it had was vegetables and colour.it was so bland Paneer gravy-2/5 Veg gravy-3/5 Chole-2.5/5 Dal makhni was decent The parathas were good The main reason I ordered here was I have tasted their food in Chennai and the taste was so authentic.i was eager to try here.its such a disappointment that a restaurant known for its authenticity gave such a bad impression.i still hold out the hope that only home delivery is this bad and restaurant maybe great P.S. I appreciate Zomato for apologising for the restaurants delay
2.0,Have been here on a few occasions and the experience had been good except for the one last Thursday. Soup served seemed to have more water. Paneer Tikka served wasn't hot which is a basic requirement.
4.0,Would like to thank Pradan Nath and Sankar for their hospitality and quick service. The food was good too and customised to our requirements. Must visit for vegetarians!
4.0,"Polite And humble service, nice ambiance, good food. Starters was good, and desert too was good. Tasty food. Drinks were good, Apple Mojito, Lemon Soda."
2.0,"Visited this place for the first time and this place was a huge disappointment. What is the point of having a fancy facade when they cant serve quality food? We ordered Dal Makhani (which tasted as some daal cooked over 15 mins let alone overnight), Paneer Lababdar (which was okayish, nothing worth 375) and the biggest disappointment of all was Sheermal, which was like a normal naan, there was no sign of Sheermal in it.  I am a huge fan of North Indian food and this place is a sham in the name of north Indian restaurants. If you want to have good north Indian, go to places like Punjabi Rasoi, Tandoori Taal etc. They have much better food for a much lesser price."
3.0,"We tried the fixed menu which was served on table in thali ,variety is good and taste as well,also took matar kulcha in ala crate combo which was tasty . Service could be improved as its quite slow . They dont accept Zomato gold on thali menu so couldnt used it which was a disappointment."
5.0,"Good Food...Padam nath served kids very well so thought to give his picture with kids. Nice place to visit for Veggies.  Great Ambience, Staff is good and food quality and taste is north indian style. You will love Maharaja thali"
5.0,"Went with my family on a Tuesday afternoon since I heard lot about there thali. Ambience was really fabulous. It's a completely indoor seating with two floor. They made few beautiful arts on there wall. By seen all that you can recall mughlai days.  Now in terms of food I love there Palak chaat, Corn and cheese tikki. In the maincourse I personally love the kofta curry and dal makhani. Jalebi was fantastic.  Now if i talk about service it was quite friendly. Staff are very active and sweet. Personally want to say Thanks to Mr.Sukant who personally take a good care of us.  Superb place. If you really like vegeterian food I will strongly suggest this place."
4.0,"On eve of dusshera, we wanted to try veg food as wife had been on fast for Navratri and we ended up at Delhi Highway. The menu for veg food looked pricey as a non-veg eater, and then we were handed a menu of buffet. So we opted for buffet as the spread was wide.   Fruit Juice was served in beginning followed by masala papad, pani puri, dahi puri and tomato dhania shorba. The tomato soup was out of the world, never tasted a better shorba, so I ordered for another bowl as well. Rest all were okay.  In starters we were served paneer tikka, achari aloo, makai kabab and Lahori kabab. Since the size of paneer was big, the flavour didnt come up well inside. Makai tikka and achari aloo was great.  The whole of thali was delicious, best being aloo gobi, dal makhni, veg dum biryani, moong dal halwa, and Channa.  The meal ended with dry fruit lassi.  Overall great food and ambience.  Food - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4.5/5"
5.0,Great food great ambience with very amazing and courteous staff . Anytime preferable for good homely food. Must visit for every vegetarian goodies in Bangalore
5.0,Good food and taste is good. Good service by Sultan and Padam. This time food was delivered fast but overall good place and good experience.
5.0,Superb place for veg food. We need of the best in bengalore. Must try Lassi. Amazing raita with Allo parantha. Nice service provided by Sultan.
5.0,"Excellent restaurant!! It's a must visit! Great ambience,wonderful hospitality! Taste is simply superb! Must try the Paratha Combo.Would definitely recommend this restaurant."
1.0,Arrived with a lot of hope to eat good North Indian food. But the reviews are misleading. Ordered thali and starters arrived after 40 mins. If a thali which is supposed to be served quickly takes 40+ mins and it is all cold and average taste then there are serious doubts I have on the genuinity of rating of this place.  I rate 1 because it doesn't deserve 4+ here.
3.0,The place is good although maintenance can be a lot better.  Food is not upto the mark. We ordered tomato soup which was cold.  Lassi was very good.  And we ordered veg platter which was okay. Veg biryani was very bad.
4.0,This was our Vijayadashami lunch and we enjoyed it. Very courteous staff and good food. We ordered the typical and did not try anything special. Overall a good experience and will surely recommend this place to my friends and family.
4.0,"Great place to enjoy North Indian delicacies. Restaurant was packed yet tables were fast moving due to their quick and efficient service. Wait time for our table was about 3-5 mins (barely anything!), Food and Service was great. A special mention to our Server Rehman, who made sure, everything we needed was made available on the table. Overall a delightful experience. Enjoy the snaps, it was totally worth the visit. Go try it out yourself!!!"
5.0,Excellent service and really good food. One of softest paneer I have eaten in Bengaluru. Definitely try Daal Makhni. 5 star for service from Mr Padam Nath.
5.0,We ordered Naram kabab and is was very tasy and crispy with panner and cheese stuffing. MUST TRY. Paneer tikka is also very soft and good :)
5.0,You can visit this place only for yummy tummy !! Excellent quality tasty food. Neat ambiance.   Food 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Staff 4/5  Nothing to complaint. Superb experience.  I would definitely go again.
5.0,"The Shahi Tukda dessert at Delhi Highway is just out of this world. One of the best, if not the best that Bangalore has to offer. Steeply priced, but real value for money. This is definitely a must try for all dessert lovers!  P.S - Zomato Gold users get 1+1 on food."
5.0,"Just been here and tried paratha combo and dum biryani, and tomato Dhaniya shorba was best, food was good and ambience was best. Thanks @Padam Nath and @Viru for your service."
5.0,"We have been here for a lunch with our colleagues the service and the food was really good, these three man made the day with all there love serving food with smile thanks to Padam math and ranjan and beemal"
3.0,Delhi Highway is a hyped place. We went their with very high expectation and our experience was not good. We had thali which I felt overpriced as the starters and main course both were not so amazing.
1.0,Heard about this restaurant and keep trying to go this place .finally got chance to go for dinner today .i had very bad experience at this place. We are group of 4people with my friends and we try Diwani handi and paneer gravy. Diwani handi is uncoked taste less. I told One of service guy  to call chef and i dont know why he denied to discribe about food.i really disappointed with food.service was great polite staff.will never visit this place anymore   Food 1/5 Service 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Staff 5/5
5.0,"Have been to this place quite many times now. The staff are very courteous. Recently I went with my friends and Mr. Padam Nath attended to us and his response was very prompt.  Must try - Dal Delhi Highway, Paneer Lababdar, Paneer Delhi Style."
5.0,"Undoubtedly the best North Indian veg food place in Indiranagara. Brilliant service and decent ambience. One of the very few places I remember the waiters name, Sulthan it is.."
4.0,"Good food and ambience as well. Starters are v good. We ordered paneer tikka, dahi kebab and charcoal mushroom out of which mushroom is a must try. Main course is little bland in taste but overall it was a good experience."
4.0,Ambience : Very Good Price : Expensive side Quality : Moderate Service : Average Reservation : Needed  Overall satisfaction was good. I would visit again and would also recommend to my friends and family.
5.0,The place was amazing and food was quite delicious .Shankarnath was really humble and served us really well.  Rabri jalebi was too good really recommend this dish.
5.0,We tried the dinner thali after great reviews from our friends and we must say that the review was true to every word we had heard. Great food and great service by Padam Nath and Mani Rool!
5.0,"Very friendly and courteous staff. Nice and satisfactory food. Value for price. Outstanding, royal ambience. Tasty food. The thali is very apt for the price. The waiter named Rehman was very very nice to us."
3.0,The food was average. We had Chipotle mushroom which was tasting average. It was spicy on the outside but bland on the inside. The ambiance is good. We had sizzling matar kulcha which was average too.  The service (padam nath) is quick and good but we have been forced to write a review in front of him.
1.0,Not at all good place to have food. We had one of the worst food experience ever with them. They will make you wait for 45 min to 1 hour and later will give you pathetic and tasteless food.
5.0,Good food!I was introduced to this place by a friend and we both had a wonderful experience here.The food is rich and authentic.I liked the food.
5.0,"Great food, really good service. Ordered paneer Delhi style. Amar and Guru were great servers. Everything was taken care of. Really pleased with the overall service and preparation"
5.0,"The service was very good and the food was very delicious and nicely presented. We ordered 2 Paratha combos, Sizzling Matar Kulche and a veg seekh kebab. Mr. Vimal and Mr. Ranjan took care of our table with their awesome service. And at the end we loved the complimentary lassi in kulhad."
5.0,"The food is really good. Ambience is great. The service is also fantastic. The rates are also nominal, and having Zomato Gold makes it quite cheaper. A must try place. Did not like their Lahori Kebab in particular, but overall, it's a must visit place for food lovers."
1.0,"I didn't enjoy the food. Apart from the name and decor, it is not worth. I am highly disappointed. We were a bunch of friends exploring the highly rated restaurant.  We ordered tandoori mushroom it was full of red chilli , amazed as punjabi food is more of spices and aromas, it tasted as of I was eating raw mushroom with sawdust.  The next dishes we ordered in faith that the food would turn out as reviewed, were Paratha combo(mix veg), Paneer Lababdar and Dal makhni. Paratha was soggy, the peas stuffing was raw. It was chewy as they said it was wheat flour but it was mixed with maida.  Paneer was a disaster, the gravy was half cooked I could taste the sourness of the tomato pure. Dal was ok or it was the soul bread winner to complete the ordered Roti's.  I am disappointed with my experience. I will not recommend this place."
2.0,"The service and food was not at all good. The staff is so much in hurry to serve. So much noise of the utensils and no discipline in the restaurant.. i was expecting a lot from this place but it was very okay type.. . As  they have so much waiting to get a table, but not worth it.. the guy cleaned the table in-front of us when we sat down.. overall what was expected went all opposite.."
4.0,The food quality and taste did not justify the price. We had lot of a lot of expectations about the place while going. It was an average experience. Ambience is just OK as the place was not very clean. There was no table clothes even though scratches were visible on tables. Not worth the price(Overrated). It was chaos at reception with managers running everywhere.
5.0,"Very good food. Service was excellent, captain Dipun. Sultan was very good.Nice ambience, nice people, menu. Specially dal makhni was very good."
5.0,Excellentll food . Amaizng ambience. Staff is very friendly. Must visit place . Loved it . Paneer tikka is must try . Mr.padam nath 5 on 5 . . Must must try . Achari panner tikka is must .
5.0,The food was on the ok to better side. It was just a normal experience until Rahman came to our service. He made sure we got the fresh food on time. We had to return one item and he happily did that.
3.0,"Went to this hotel place with very high expectations but the overall experience was kind of OK.  First big turn off, the potatos looked awkwardly red in colour- dont know if restaurant is using food  colours but clearly not very exciting to eat.  Other dish ordered chole kulcha were very normal nothing extraordinary as expected the North Indian touch(completely missing)  Service was good.  Food-5/10 Service-7/10 Ambience-7/10 Price-5/10(expensive as compared to quality and quantity)  Recommendation: One can try other places !!"
5.0,Polite and gentle staff. Mr Padam Nath assured good service and ambiance. Paneer tikka masala and paneer daily style was good too. Good interiors.
5.0,"Awesome food! Great service by Sultan..  Loved aloo tikki and kulcha sizzler..  Will visit again for sure..  Situated in the heart of Indiranagar, this is the place to enjoy sumptuous north indian food!"
5.0,"It's an authentic North Indian food joint. The ambience and food truly depicts Delhi's atmosphere. Will definitely visit this again.  The Thali is the must try. It has various combinations of starters and Chaat, ending with some sweet lassi."
5.0,This is a vegetarian paradise.ambiance is like mughal darbaar. What i like about this place the most is the behaviour of the staff and the manager is also honest  and polite  person.    A perfect choice of veg cuisine with the authentic touch of delhi and some royalfood flavours.  A must visit and  will be on my all time option list for my friends party.  Ambience _ 5.0 Service _ 5.0 Food quality_ 5.0 Accesbility_ 5.0
3.0,"I keep getting told that I didn't order the right thing thats why I ain't ranking Delhi Highway any higher but I usually use Dal Makhini as a yardstick to measure how good North Indian resto's are. And to be honest the Dal did fall short of expectations. For appetizers we ordered the Lahori Kebab, Raj Kachori and the Dahi ke Kebab. The Raj Kachori was fantastic, the Lahori Kebab brilliant but the Dahi Ke Kebab could have been better. We had assorted roti's for mains with Dal so nothing to add further there. The service was excellent with 'Padam Nath' taking care of us throughout our experience but with the prices what they are I doubt I'll ever come back..."
5.0,Good food. Good service. Keep up the good work. Ordered mashroom starter which was as expected. The main course too was good. Great service by Sultan. Little improvement on Lassi is required. All over good experience.
4.0,Excellent parathas here. The other food here is also quite good. Service also is pleasant. You should come here for a good north indian experience
5.0,"It all started with the ambiance. The first impression was excellent as the ambiance was cozy and warming. The staffs were very polite and the one who served us, Mr. Padam Nath was really nice. He had a thorough knowledge about what he was serving us and his recommendations were worth eating. The most chosen items belonged to the MUST TRY category and all of us enjoyed every thing that we ordered.(from starters to desserts) The food was upto the mark, just as I expected and I would love to come back here. Thank you!"
4.0,"An Authentic Delhi Cuisine. Ambience is like mughal darbaar. We ordered Gol gappe, mutter kulcha Sizzler and Aloo paratha combo.The gol gappe are served with different juices. Worth a try but personally didn't enjoy the variety. The Kulchas and parathas taste amazingly good here. Delicious food I must say, we'd a good time. Rehman took a good care of us."
5.0,Awesome food and decor. Sultan served us very well. Thanks for the hospitality. Further I would recommend Thali with lot of delicious options. Keep it up.

5.0,Nice taste and great ambience. I can suggest to come here if you are a north Indian food lover and paneer lababdaar was delicious and kudos to Rahman
1.0,"Nothing about this place is good. Loud ambience. Uncomfortable seats. Food spilled over floor. Zero cleanliness. Food on the floor and unclean utensils. Staff is in tremendous hurry to clear out the plates before you even finish.  Food Taste: 2/5 No pickles or vinegar onion. Not even close to authentic Delhi cuisine.  They don't care when you give them feedback. However, when they saw me writing this review(by sneaking in my phone), the waiter started pestering me that he hasn't done anything wrong in his service and that was the only thing he cared about.  Not worth even a single visit."
5.0,Delicious food nd supr fast service.. Padam nath men u doing d best.. Keep going.. Ambience is good bt music need to change.. Mini roll tandoori chimichuri wd salasa ws best.. Biriyani ws awsm.. Keep up good food nd service.

5.0,"After shaw the zomato rating we planned to visit this place. Its great vegiterian restaurant in indiranagar area. Went with family without reservation. Waiting was 1hour but thanx to manager sukanth he arranged a table within 30minutes at 1st floor. Ambiance is like old mughal palace with white and golden colors of themes.. Food was really good. Specifically Dahi poori chat,paneer delhi style and kadai pasta was extremely good. Dessert jalebi rabdi was fantastic. Staffs were verry politely . Handling over crowd with full presence and with politeness ."
3.0,"Its high rated restaurant with above average food quality. Try to avoid rush. Was overcrowded during our visit this Sunday morning. Starter we tried cream of tomato and mix of paneer tikka platter. Was so so. Veg karahi was very oily. Roti was half cooked. May be due to heavy rush,   Jalebi with Rabdi was awesome. Will try It on some regular day."
4.0,Liked this place and the food was great except for some misses.  Panner sabzi and dahi kabab were awesome. Veg kadhai was also very good.  Some improvement areas. Papad in masala papad was soggy. Mushroom soup was very balnd and tasteless.

1.0,We had gone to Delhi Highway looking at the Zomato ratings which was 4.6 that is a really good rating. We had previously taken a reservation over phone for 9 pm yet we had to wait there for over 45 mins and when asked when we'll get a table they plainly answered just another 5 mins. After a really long wait and starving when we finally sat down to order no one was coming to take our orders. The food quality was also really bad. The taste very bad and synthetic types. The food was cold when it reached our table. Lastly when we ordered a lassi it was so sweet that even a person who does not have diabetes will get it after drinking the whole thing. My overall experience for this place was just not pleasant and will never like to visit there again.
5.0,"One of the best places in bengaluru for north indian food with great ambience and service. Loved their mozzarella kulchas, sheermal and lahori paneer, great shahi tukda too."

5.0,"Good food. Nice service by Rehman. So much crowd so it took longer waiting time but whatever we ordered... Mushroom, paneer lababdar and all were good in taste."
2.0,"It looks so grand when it comes to ambience. The waiting time is too long to get a table. So given these things, the expectation becomes high from this restaurant. The food doesn't keep upto the hype. To clarify that, only some dishes are good but others aren't that good. The table allotment process is not satisfactory either. The prices seem to be of Delhi standards and not of Bangalore. If they could maintain consistency in all the dishes. This restaurant would be worth the time and money."

1.0,"The food was very bad no taste at all. Also the service was too late, waiters were not at all attentive to customers. I would never recommend my friends this restaurant."
3.0,"Good north Indian food. The ambience is a trifle opulent for my taste. When you read the word Highway, you think dhaba food. But it's not. It's rich, creamy gravies. So that disappoints. The food is ok. Presentation is good. Overall, average."
1.0,If it should have negative rating i should have given negative also.Never go to this restutant if you are north indian.Service is too bad.Dnt go with image .
5.0,"Such a royal ambience and the food was delicious. I have ordered corn palak, paneer delhi style, butter roti, butter naan, ghee rice and lassi. Lassi wasn't that great but every other dish was luscious.  Perfect place for scrumptious north indian food."
3.0,"Visited Delhi highway in a quest to have a good Punjabi meal! Ordered the Tomato Dhaniya Shorba. For starters we ordered the special recommendation of their in-house Paneer Kebab, which was very bland, didn't enjoy the taste at all. The Shorba was authentic, and had a nice fragrance of Dhaniya with the right amount of spice. For main course, we had the Vegetable Kadhai sabzi which was good. A decent option for Indian food in the heart of Indiranagar with a decent ambience."
5.0,"Got a chance to visit this place yesterday which was Sunday. Probably one of the best vegetarian restaurants in Bangalore. Had to wait for 30 mis to get in at 10 PM. Nice ambiance. They are trying to portray the old Delhi or a fort kind of ambiance inside. Catchy! Now let's come to the food. Started with Masala papad, dahi kebabs and cheddar mushroom. All of the items were really good. Dahi kebab was the best amongst those. In the main course we had misi roti, paneer labardar, Kashmiri dum alu, Pindi chana. Loved everything. Also tried the Hyderabadi Biryani (did not like, probably a wrong Choice by us, but compensated with other dishes). And the best part was desserts. Had Jalebi with Rabdi and Anjeer ka halwa.. Jalebi with Rabdi was so good. Mouthwatering. Courteous service by the guys over there. Thanks!"

4.0,"Ambiance  The place is spacious and has seating in the ground as well as the upper floor.  Food  Delhi style paneer was good and worth trying.  The pani puri shots were good.  One thing is that the masala content in the items were mild which suits to my liking.  The thali had too many items in it. The down side is that you start feeling full if you just try out all the items in it. (My personal opinion)  Overall  A good place to dine with family.  Great option for pure vegetarian North Indian Cuisine.   The pricing is bit on the higher side for the veg food they offer.  Service is good, but will be a little slower during peak hours.  Valet parking is available."
1.0,"Rude welcome, thank you for letting us avoid an even more unpleasant experience. Will surely not recommend. Improve if you want to survive,else ignore."

Also, very receptive to suggestions. Ordered the following:  Fried masala papad -- Good Sweet and sour lime soda -- Avoidable Aaloo Tikki Chaat -- Bad, less of Tikki and more of Chhole made a mess of it (this is what they proposed to change) Veg Pulao -- Very good Delhi Style Paneer -- Good Shahi Tukda -- Bad (they didn't charge for this)"

4.0,"One of the unique restaurant where buffet is served at the place from started to main course and deserts instead of we going and getting food. The cost is also not too high, it cost around 600 per person including tax. Starters were awesome, by the time you get into main course you will almost be full.

Makai kabbab was really good. And before we started, the mint chutney and Amla pickle was placed on the table. Amla pickle was pretty good, we kept eating it till the starter came in. The best part about them was they replaced our aloo tikki chat when we told them we want it without dahi, even after it was all ready. So it pretty courteous on their part. And the dal and rice was good as well. Great service and reasonably priced."

4.0,"After hearing a lot from my friends about this place ,I planned my sunday lunch here. As expected ambiance was royal dine-in which is a rarity in bangalore . Delhi highway gives perfect feel of north indian traditional restraunts .However, place was overcrowded , had to wait 15 mins even after prior booking. Table booked is highly recommended , as wait time without booking was 40 mins. I ordered their signature naram kebabs with mint chutney, and guys they were really amazing, took me to food streets of old delhi. I am a big fan of paranthe wali gali ke paranthe , and when I saw the same in menu ,couldn't resist and ordered the same. I will say paranthe were not that tasty , but I liked the dahl which came with paranthas , even lassi was not that great . Delhi highway is a must go place ,specially punjabi cuisine lovers.Definitely visiting again .  Cheers !"

4.0,"Visited this place for lunch with family yesterday and I must say it felt like a royal lunch. We chose a la carte instead of thali as we doubted our abilities to finish the thalis:D For starters, we had lahori kabab and masala papad. Papad was fried and topped with the usual Vegetables and seasoned with salt. Lahori kabab was of a lovely color and had 6 servings. It tasted so good with the mint chutney. For main course we ordered garlic naan and diwani handi. The naan was light and buttered well. The curry felt like heaven while having with onion and lemon juice. The amla pickle and chilli pickle were so yum and delicious. We then had sweet and salt lime soda to digest all the food. Ambience was beautiful, giving a royal feel and the interiors were greatly done. Totally loved this place. Coming back definitely after a few days/ months to try the thali :D :P must visit !!"

5.0,Nice place. Good is food. Nice Bollywood romantic songs in the background. Made my day as I visited this place with my date for the first time. Staff was polite and quite attentive. Do visit.
4.0,"This is a vegetarian paradise. It is a fine dine restaurant. The ambience is themed to give a royal look. The entrance has an Archway.  What I like about this place the most is the behaviour of the staff, they do not hover and rush you into finishing your meals even when the crowd comes in.  They serve a Punjabi Thali and people can also choose the Ala Carte menu. The Punjabi Thali includes 1soup, 1 juice, 2 chaats (we got the dahi papadi chat and gol gappe), approx 5-6 Tandoori and Kebab starters, the main course includes variety of tandoor rotis, dal makhani, 2-3 Vegetable curries, 1 paneer dish, 2 sweets, 1 biryani, Raita, fresh cut Veggies (whew!) And Sweet Lassi, Buttermilk (unlimited). So if you are someone with a good appetite this Thali is a definite Yes for you. I personally am not a fan of extra masala, and this place fits my palette perfectly. Although the quantity is a bit too much for me I should admit. Right from the Crispy Masala Papad to their Gulab Jamun, everything was delicious. My hardcore non vegetarian friends seemed to enjoy the meal as much as I did. The staff is extremely courteous and keep refilling your plate and enquiring about any issues or concerns.  I definitely recommend this place for a good Punjabi meal with the family.  Cheerios Delhi Highway. Keep up the good food serving and we will keep coming back."

5.0,"Have you ever got awesome hospitality as well as sumptuous food simultaneously? If Yes, then you should try this place for a change. If No, then you should definately hop into Delhi Highway.  This ""delhi-cious"" Vegan place is located right at the apex corner of Indiranagar near Sony Signal. While you enter this place you will start to get an Classic Indian Vibe. Interiors are awesomely decorated with ample of spacing between the seats. Ambience is what makes you feel great about this place.  Coming to the food it was just beautiful, though its a proper Vegan-Friendly resturant it keeps your hopes on. However, while we were completely confused on what to order. When we got an option for a ""Thali"". Being in bangalore we are always ""Egh! Not again"" about the plate. But trust me on this they have changed the entire concept of Thali there. Don't be surprised you fall in love with the quality of food they serve on Thali.  It all started with #TomatoBadamSorbaSoup + 16 more dishes to finish. They know how to impress people with food without burning your brain on huge menu and your pocket as well. It comprises of almost everything with the same taste. Along with a perfect timing of food on the plate. I can hardly recall any delay from them. It was like one after the other with lot of humbleness from the staff.  The staff around were humble and polite, was on to feed you till your hearts content.  Overall its has been an awesome experience with them.  Cheers to the team. Keep it up!"
5.0,Excellent food and spread.. service was brilliant..would like to call out Sultan for his attitude and service.. overall was a great experience
5.0,"Place will remind one of the 'Shahi' era, even the interiors will highlight the same. There are two floors. Sitting arrangement is also good. One need to book the table if going during weekends. Service is good and quick. Staffs are helpful, though at the end every restaurant ask you to review them on Zomato, but here they will ask you to review then and there (at least it happened with us), which at times feel like compulsion, here is what the staffs can improve upon. They can ask for a review and people will give them pleasant review for sure. Now coming to food. We ordered Thali and they have this concept of unlimited, so you can order anything on Thali n number of times. So by the time we were leaving, we were full till the neck. Thali comprises of starters, main course and dessert and all were good, in starters they first gave us a Masala papad, lichi juice, then tomato baadam shorma which was so creamy, then Golgappe and dahi chat. They have this peculiar way of giving Golgappe which reminds you of vodka shots. After that they will give paneer tikka and two items more and then the main course will arrive, you will find dessert in that only. And lastly they will give you Lassi in Kulhad which I love. We also ordered Chhole Bhature and Dahi bhalle. Bhature were double of the size of what you generally find, they were soft and chole was also good. It is such a good place for vegetarians. And it is Value for Money place. A Thali cost you around 540 with tax which will fill you and your stomach to the fullest and satisfied."

The potato cheese snack was okayish, nothing great.  Malai kofta was great however there were too few pieces of kofta and a lot of gravy. Pindi channe were much better than any other place in Bangalore."
4.0,"This place has an amazing ambience given that it's a pure vegetarian restaurant. It's situated at the heart of Indiranagar. This restaurant does justice to it's name. Authentic North Indian vegetarian cuisine with amazing starters. The Delhi Highway Special dishes are a must try! Go for Tandoori mushroom starter, it's amazing. Chandni Chowk ki chaat and biryani are delicious. Parking can be a problem at evenings. The wait is really long during weekends. But overall, a vegetarians delight and an amazingly cozy place."

4.0,"It was always on my wishlist to try this place but somehow the idea of spending on Vegetarian food for a hardcore non vegetarian like me didn't seem worth it at all hence I always let it be. Fortunately we had a farewell lunch sponsored by one of my colleagues and hence I had a chance to taste food from here.  We had ordered for the thali on Zomato the thali consisted of two starters which were hara bhara kabab and naram Dil ke kabab, wrapped in a foil were rotis, four types of curries which were Dal makhani, mixed veg, paneer butter masala and some other gravy. There was also pulao and raitha with salad. The starters were good and were delicious. The rotis were soft and went well with all the curries. The paneer was good other than paneer the best thing was Dal makhani. It was just way too delicious. The rest of the gravies were okay. Rice pulao was again average and raitha was mint flavoured. For dessert there was gulab jamun which was again another best thing in the thali.  Overall it was a good meal, hard to finish everything on the plate and a one time try for a non vegetarian like me."

We ordered 1) charcoal mushrooms : Really well thought dish with slight panner stuffing. Very creative. Tasty as well. 2) fresh pesto kebabs : lovely tikkis. So soft and tasty. We loved the chutney which was garnished on top. It complimented the dish very well. 3) Mini tandoori rolls with chimichuri sauce : We really liked this dish. It was filling, creative and appetising. We were almost full with the starters. But we thought of ordering one more Delhi Highway special. Hence sizzling mutter kulche. This was very light on the tummy and it was like normal dish. The only speciality was the way it was served as a sizzler. Overall a good experience. Staff is really well trained and courteous. The price is slightly expensive but otherwise a must visit place"

Ordered for charcoal mushroom and masala papas for starters. Charcoal mushroom is  a must try for those who prefer spicy food. Since we werent really hungry we decided to skip the main course and ordered for jeera rice delhi highway special back dal which is nothing but dal makhni. Dal makhni was simply amazing! The restaurant is slightly overpriced but its worth paying a visit once in a while if u guys want to have good North Indian food.  Service 3.5/5 Food 4.5/5 Ambience 4/5 VFM 3.5/5"

4.0,"I got to know about this restaurant from a colleague, booked a table for lunch. Surprisingly, it was spacious and filled and was vegetarian Placed the order in 10 min and the food was served quickly. Ordered main course thali.  The restaurant Delhi Highway was visited with my family - 1st visit. The ambience is very cool & serene. The AC is as regulated well.  For the main course it was a mix of regular North Indian fare for the elders in the group  again well cooked, delectable taste and not at all heavy on the oil or masalas.  The younger lot choose a variety of fusion food  Sizzling Mutter Kulcha (authentic Delhi street style Kulchas), Fulka Tacos and Mozarella Kulchas  all of them sent our taste buds to high heavens.  The service was extremely helpful  kudos to Rehman. Keep It up!!!"

2.0,Ambience is good.... serve is good ..But food was okay okay... Not tat happy with food... Seeing review we had been to this place... But not worth it...
4.0,Go for this place if you are looking for good and slightly royal kind of Ambience with veg food. Options are limited but good and so is the proportion .Staff is also very polite and friendly
5.0,"Went to this place on Saturday night located on indranagar ,12th main road. They have valet parking available, when you enter the place it gives you a royal feeling. But make sure to get the booking done in advance, else there is waiting. But we had not done the advance booking but got table in 20 mins. They have two floor sitting, ground floor and first floor. First floor has bigger sitting area , and the ambiance will give you a royal feeling. We sat on the first floor. Coming to the food we ordered:  1. Naram dil kebab: a crispy kebab made up of cottage cheese inside and yummy in taste. 2. Charcoal Mushroom: these were stuffed mushroom very nice in taste. 3. Dahi Papdi chaat: a must have for chaat lovers very nice in taste. 4. Mocktail: made up of blueberry and strawberry very unique and nice in taste. For the Main course: 1. Dal makhani: just perfect and thick in taste ,one of the best i had in Bangalore. 2. Paneer lababdar: Very soft paneer cubes with tomato gravy, nice one. 3. Tandoori baby kulchas: a very nice small kulchas with cheese stuffing and served with very nice garlic chutney. A must try. Last but not the least desert we had jalebi with rabri and it was just awesome and perfect in taste. Recommended.  The service is also good, staff is courteous, only thing which i felt is missing is vinegar onion with main course since it is a Delhi based restaurant, this is a must thing.   Earlier this place was serving lunch and dinner but now they have come up with their new menu serving breakfast and snacks as well.  This new menu consists of Lip Smacking Chaats from Delhi and some famous street foods from Delhi which are entirely pure veg since the restaurant is entirely pure veg.  So we started of with their chaats which had:  1. dahi bhalla papdi chaat: It is the best dish here a must try, made with papdi , bhalla, lots of sweet curd.  2. Allu tikki Chaat: another amazing chaat made with allu tikki and chole.  3. Pani poori shots: these had 4 flavors in it sweet, khatta, mango and cranberry.  4. Halwa with poori: a traditional old delhi snacks which had pooris with an awesome halwa.  5. Poori served with allu and pumpkin sabji: this had basically poori with stuffing of dal served with allu sabji, pumpkin sabji, boondi raita and salad. Awesome in taste.  6. Chole kulche: authentic north indian street food which had white chole with kulcha and home made pickle.  7. Chole samosa: another nice dish with had samosa served with chole, but i think this should be served after dipping samosa with chole.  8. Bread pakoda: this was bread pakoda stuffed with paneer and potato served with green chutney and sweet chutney. awesome in taste.  last but not the least we had:  9. Jalebi with rabdi : this was just awesome, hot crispy jalebi served with rabri.  And also the sweet lassi an amazing one.  All the dishes were served in authentic way like u get in streets on leaf patta, and had an amazing presentation.                                             foodtravelpedia.wordpress.com"
1.0,Food was not great. Too pricey for the quality. The menu says badam shorba which is misleading and finally was given tomato shorba with badam pieces. It should be changed in menu to Tomato Badam shorba which isn't a great one to try. The sizzling matar kulche is also too misleading on the menu saying they serve best matar kulche and ended up having mix veg kulcha with plain ragda pattice ka matar gravy...this sizzling plate is not worth 350 rs at all..who would appreciate giving Soo much for one mix veg kulcha and bland boiled matar gravy. Finally we ended up ordering Hyderabadi dum biryani. We were served the normal Thali ka biryani which was mixed with few chunks of cold paneer cubes which was not served hot and we asked them to take back the tasteless biryani and cancel it. Our Sunday lunch was bland and too disheartened.
5.0,Very nice place...The place is little crowded on the weekends.All the dishes were awsome especially the shahi Muglai panner curry is the best.The Naans are so soft.Padamnath and Moni Roll helped us very much in selecting the apropriate menu.The service was also very good.
5.0,We had a great time. We had ordered 3 starters and a main course which was really delicious and worth it. The staff Guru and Salman were very kind and suggested the right kinda food. Very happy with this place.
5.0,"Having fun here Nice staff and good service. Thanks to Rehman and Dipun for making the day wonderful. Nice malai kofta and shahi mughlai paneer, lassi and paneer tilka platter. Good staters and main course food"
5.0,"Staff is very patient and polite.  Food was great too. Bit pricy but we had 2 Zomato gold members to compensate.  Our group had 2 people ordering Jain food and 2 ordering Non-Jain food. What followed was confusion regarding our orders. However, Maksadul, and Guru, who had managed our orders here, maintained their calm and made sure that we received our orders correctly."
4.0,"Brilliant ambiance, amazing food and the staff and very friendly. Its very crowded so will suggest you to have your table booked in prior. Tummy full filling experience  I seriously have food baby in me, i stuffed so much there.  But thankyou delhi highway staff for the kind service and god bless."
4.0,"Decided to visit this place on a Sunday afternoon after having heard that it is one of the finest north indian restaurants in Bangalore. Must say was not disappointed at all. It is highly recommended that table is booked before hand as the place is always crowded and it might take a lot of time to get a table. We got a table every soon as I had booked through Zomato. We ordered tandoori roti, malai kofta and daal sunehri. The daal sunehri was really yummy with predominating aroma of desi ghee which enhanced the taste. The malai kofta was well cooked though it was a bit too sweet. The ambience is really amazing and the decor gives a royal touch and feel to the place. The staff is extremely courteous and polite and the service was really great and quick. Overall, the experience was good although it is a bit high on the price."

5.0,The food is extremely delicious and the service was up to the mark. Special shout out to Padamnath and Biru for making it a memorable experience.
2.0,Had great expectations but utterly disappointed.. The food does not justify the exorbitant pricing. 80 bucks for a plain Roti are you kidding me?? The taste is just OK nothing exciting.  Moreover the Valet dashed my car which i came to know the next day.. Be careful and inspect your vehicle while leaving.  Overall a regrettable experience.
3.0,Staff was very nice. Starters were pretty good. Dahi chaat was awesome but maharaja thali was not worth at all. If you want to go please don't opt for maharaja thali.

1.0,"Saw the amazing rating rating of this restaurant and pleased to know that there's a Delhi cusine restaurant nearby, We went there.  Now I don't know why it is so much overrated. The food is extremely expensive and taste doesn't come even closer to the cost.  We ordered veg seekh kabab and Paneer Lahori. Not even close to delhi's taste or texture.  Waste of money. Any normal restaurant tastes better than this.  We ordered most spicy paneer dish ( paneer lahori) suggested by the staff. That was just high tomoto. Not at all spicy"
5.0,You will get amazing food and good customer service here. Must try parantha combo and moong dal halwa. Really appreciate the service by Padmanath.
5.0,"It's located in 12th main, indiranagar .interior is verry nice . Golden and whithe themes.. i went with my friends.. specially i m non vegiterian.. but here vegiterian food is great.i forgot the non veg.. all food was delhi style.. Service people are giving prompts service with happily.."

5.0,It was a great experience.. Food was delicious.... And the service was great.. Loved the place.. Everyone should try it. Ambience A's well is great
4.0,Food was good. Tried the panner Tikka and mushroom Chipotle.  Service could have been better. Either waiters are not adequately staffed or they are unable to handle the crowd.
1.0,The place is overhyped and overpriced. Bland tasteless food. Don't know why it is always overcrowded. Had booked a table on Zomato for 830 pm. Table was not allloted till 9:15.
1.0,"The only thing tasty here was complimentary raw onion and lemon! There was no flavour, salt in food.. Chat was fine though.. There was awfully long waiting time even when we booked table hours ago"
1.0,"""Disappointing"" I went there on a Sunday evening to celebrate my birthday with family. There was a waiting of 45 mins which was expected as we visited on a weekend without prior reservation. After long wait we finally got the table on first floor. The ambience was good and we were happy that it was worth waiting. But soon we realized that getting table was easy but to get a menu and placing the order is even more painful. Everyone was running here and there without caring about customers. After waiting for again 10-15 mins we got menu and placed our order which included soup, starters and main course. Now coming to the food. We got soup within 15-20 mins but I guess it was coming from refrigerator directly as it was ice cold. Also, for starters we kept on asking for sauce or chutney but nothing came on time. we complained about the same to the person who served us but he didn't care. We had to leave food and inform the manager about the quality of food and service and then things got bit better. Overall a very bad experience. Rude and ignorant staff. Food was ok but place definitely doesn't deserve 4.1 zomato rating."
5.0,"We loved the food here we had booked both alacarte and thali, both were really good we had a great time and the ambience is great and service was good, thank you to Guru great service."
4.0,This is good for vegetarian north indian food. They have created few twists in their menu and have great options. If you plan to go to this place be ready to wait for 40 to 45 mins to get table. It has waiting even on working days...so just be prepared.
5.0,It was really good experience here. Food service and ambience was good.. Help full staff. Recommended item sahi firni and shahi tukda.. Padamnath
3.0,Glad: Ambience is good.  Gives you a feeling of royalty with the interiors and structure.  Kind of a family place and good for pure veg people.  Staff was courteous.  Mad: Long waiting on sunday night.  With the name delhi highway initially i thought they will serve nonveg as well like dhabbas on delhi highway ;)  Sad: Food quality was ok ok type. Not much variety in the menu. Special lassi was not at all special. It felt like sour curd with sugar. I ordered paneer and mushroom which tasted average. Average food quality. Didnt find anything that will force me to go again.
5.0,"Ordered sunheri dal, plain rice, bhindi do pyaza and moong dal ka halwa. Loved the taste. Served hot and delicious. The service men here are polite, friendly and always smiling.

5.0,"Very friendly staff amazing food ambience and music. Staff is really amazing (padam Nath, Amar, Rahman) and friendly. Malaikofta is really amazing."
1.0,"Went in on a Sunday with a lot of expectation but their welcome staff had no regrets shooing away people by announcing a 1 hour waiting period, furthering the conversation the guy informed that there was so many people waiting that it didnt matter if guests didn't come back ! Dunno about the food but hospitality is awful ! I wonder I would ever go back to this place"
4.0,"We went for lunch here today. We had booked the table but arrived 10 minutes late. Our 3 year old son was very hungry and started crying. We explained the situation to the person at the reception and requested him for a table quickly. He helped us with a comfortable table within 10 minutes.  We ordered main course directly. Chole Batura and Paneer Parathas combo.  Baturas were good and our son relished the same. Chole was cooked well. Paneer Paratha were little spicy as green chillies were sprinkled in the stuffing. Accompaniments: Dal Makhani, Channa and Raita were good.  Delhi special lassi was fine.  Overall a nice lunch. We will visit again."
4.0,"Ordered Mini thali . Was good with Mix of all tastes ,North, northwest Frontier and with south flavour too. Food quantity was good for one person however they should add some sweets too!! delhiwala meetha khate hai"
5.0,"Polite staff, relaxed and themed ambience and great host Mr. Padam. Dahi ke kabab are a must try. Mutter ke kulche was an unique dish, however the gravy given could've been better. Try panipuri for an unique experience."
5.0,"Real Indian Feels Delhi Highway !  After eating a lot of Italian, American and Chinese every weekend in Bangalore, we decided to go back to our roots and try something Indian this time. And we went to Delhi Highway to satisfy our food cravings.  AMBIENCE: You get royal feel as soon as you see the restaurant from outside and also when step inside it. The copper plated glasses and serving utensils. Decorated chairs and tables and artistically designed blue interiors against warm yellow lights makes the ambience amazing.  FOOD: Tamatar with Holy Basil Shorba: Yumm. A tangy, mildly spicy shorba (shorba is basically thin soup without cream) with lot of flavors punched in it.  Achari Paneer Tikka: Very larges chunks of Paneer, cooked to perfection in different pickled sauces. Mind you it's a heavy dish.  Dahi ke Kebab: One of the best Dahi Kebabs I've ever tasted in my life. Must have. The hung yogurt is perfectly mixed with other ingredients and deep fried optimally to give such a delicious taste.  Sizzling Matar Kulche: A okish dish. Kulchas were good, but the sabji accompanying it was a bit blant. Can make it more tangy and serve with lemon.  Pani Puri: The costliest Pani Puri ever tasted . Those I personally like only 2/6 flavors. But the presentation is different and makes it appealing.  The prices are on bit higher side, but then ZOMATO GOLD !  SERVICE: Probably, one of the best services I encountered in recent days in Bangalore. Mr. Padam Nath was taking care of our service and he was exceptionally good in his job. He knew all the dishes and helped us in food selection according to our interest in taste. Service is pretty quick and staff is courteous.  Overall, Food: 4.5/5 Ambience: 5/5 Service:5/5 Value for money: 4.5/5 (considering Zomato Gold)"
5.0,padam nath was wonderful giving a good service and very polite and welcoming .. food was good and very much filling... a typical desi place for a nice heavy dinner
3.0,Service was particularly good by Padam nath . Food was ok...We ordered dahi sekh kabab...It was good but paneer was ok....Not that great..Little disappointed.
3.0,Starter was good but more items can be added. Biryani in the main course can be replaced with some good item. Didn't like it but service with all smiling faces made me to stay long there. Ambience is pretty good.
4.0,"Shout out to North Indian food lovers and vegetarians. One of the best North Indian food Ive had in Bangalore in a long time.  I always kept looking for that perfect Dal Makhni, found my place. They serve amazing Variety of paneer and not to forget jalebi Rabri is the star."
5.0,"Had thali, amazing food and service. Guru served us and was amazing. Good variety in the thali. Food quality is also great. Naram dil kebab is a must try.. Only come here for the thali if you can eat"
5.0,Amazing food and hospitality. Kudos to Guru and Salman making it a pleasant dining experience. Ended the meal with mouthwatering Shahi Tukda. A place must visit.
4.0,"We went for lunch on a weekend. FYI, you have to book a table in advance and even then you will end up waiting for a table. The place can be quite crowded and a little chaotic. It has an ethnic ambience with soft lighting. The food was okay. They can improve the quality a bit though. Nevertheless , it is a fun place to dine with families or large group of friends...."
2.0,"Good ambience, decent service, but sub par food. Ordered Achari Paneer Tikka (good) and Cheese Tandoori Aloo (not good) for starters, and Veg Kadhai (tasteless) and Paneer Lababdar (not good)."
4.0,Great food. Wonderful ambience. Tried the thaali option and it was great. Starters to mains.. all great. Parking on this road can be a problem but thankfully valet parking helps. Service was a little slow but otherwise no complaints.
4.0,the packaging was really bad
5.0,Loved this place. The food is amazing especially North Indian and in love with jalebi and rabdi  And amazing service by Padam Nath  good job.
3.0,"Ambience was good. Hot unlimited food with lot of options though did not meet the expectation. Tomato soup was water with a pinch of tomato and salt. Starters were okay except paneer tikka which was actually good. naram Dil was very naram with no spice. In Panipuri, Puri seemed old but pani was good. Overall Food was average. Good quantity but lacks taste."
5.0,Food was yummmm and tastyyyy. The staff very polite and helpfulll. Turned out to be a good visit overall. Thanks to Mr. Padang Nath. Would visit again
5.0,"Fantastic food and taste. Jeera rice tasted very good . Roti , naan veg kadai are also very good. Service from Mr Padam Nath got good service."
5.0,Polite staff. Great Food. Must visit for North Indian. Good ambience. We got a full feel of a delhi dining experience. Service by padam nath
5.0,Mr padam Nath was very active in serving and attending the guests. Restaurant is pretty decent for family dinner and pure veg. Ambience is nice and quality is pure North Indian
2.0,"This place was highly recommended by my office colleagues but my experience of this place was terrible. The restaurant is over crowded on weekends, you might have to wait close to 45 mins. After a long wait when you get the table, service becomes a problem. Waiters don't believe in taking note of your order and instead depend on there memorising skills. We ordered 5 items and got only 4 on our table coz the 5th one was forgotten. The cream tomato soup was cold and Dahi ke kebab(which is there must try) was terrible. After the starters comes the long wait for main course, which was decent enough. I didn't find anything great in this place and I guess it's overhyped and expensive  Food-3/5 Service-2/5 Ambiance-3/5"
5.0,"I had fantastic experience here and that was pretty obvious. This place is a delight.  Food Quality, Ambience & Service all are fab. Padamnath took care of us really well."
5.0,"Very good joint for vegetarians. We had the full fledged thali on a Saturday afternoon which came bundled with a welcome drink, chaat, soup, few tandoori starters, 4 subjis, roti, biryani and 2 sweets.  Overall, a full filling meal. Make sure to go there with a huge appetite!"
5.0,Padmanath gave excellent service (salman assistant).  Food did not leave upto the expectations.  ( paneer lababdar).  My due to high crowd they couldnt deliver but overall amazing time
3.5,"Visited on a weekday dinner on my birthday . Infrastructure is mesmerising. Like a king/queen feeling with the ambience. Tried chat items - worth trying and a proper dinner place, the one who love to click pics is an add on! I think they should more variety over all 3.5"
5.0,"Amazing experience! Padam Nath was very polite and hospitable. Tasty food and ambience! Although waiting time was long because we arrived at a very busy hour, but the food was worth. :)"
4.0,Food: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service : 4/5 A good restaurant with tasty paneer dishes. The ambience is very good and service is pretty prompt. Nice place to go if you wish to have authentic and typical Delhi food.
5.0,Very tasty food and centrally located. Staff is also very polite. Very good pure vegetarian food at bangalore and it seems that the search has finally come to an end.
5.0,Food was good and service was lovely. People were very kind and able to help work around my food allergy. Only complaint was that my stomach couldnt fit more food in it!
4.0,I am a south Indian so I dont know how the food is supposed to taste like in Delhi but one think I do know is that he food here was awesome. Mushroom lovers must try the charcoal mushroom. One tip- lunch time on a weekend gets very crowded so go early to have fast service
5.0,"Food was very Good, Ambiance was also good, Hospitality of Salman was nice........................................................:::::.:....."
1.0,Not good food
4.0,Ambience is beautiful. Quality of food is super delicious and quantity is enough. Service is good and fast. Best place to visit with family and friends. Good for vegetarians.
4.0,An all time favourite for North Indian food. Tomato dhaniya shorba is a must try. Baby kulchas are also good. Special mention for the special pickles prepared by the chef. These pickles are so yum that I sometimes feel like asking them to pack some for home. ;) Light music and fine dining set up makes it a perfect place to enjoy a casual dinner with family and friends.
5.0,It was after long time me and my wife decided to try something different than the usual non-veg restaurants that we frequent in Indira Nagar. Delhi Highway with the huge entrance greeted us. We had Paneer Lababdar and Garlic Naan. This is the best paneer dish we had in some time. Paneer was meeting inside the mouth. Thanks to staff Padam Nathji for the recommending this!
4.0,Heyy this place is very good with a great ambiance and great service. The person who gave us service (Salman) was very nice and was perfect and very polite to us as well
5.0,"Great food. Good place for families. The thaali is value for money. Enjoyed the starters, the ambience. Rehman was especially sweet. Nice experience all in all"
2.0,"Exterior attracted me to get in. ""Delhi highway"", if u adopt this name for a restaurant, you should understand the actual delhi taste, preparation and the menu. Chats was ok, welcome drink avoid, if you could. Paneer tikka and other starters were just ok. Flavoured rice was decent. Paneer gravy was below average. Daal makhni was good. Completely disappointed with chole. A stone hit my gum when i was trying to understand the taste of chole. Rest of things were just ok. I was shocked when i was told that there is no single tawa item available. I mean really? If delhi highway management is reading this comment, please try to serve the authentic delhi food or reduce the price by half."
5.0,Food was awesome.
5.0,Good food and service .. thanks padam nath for best service and food recommendation  sizzling platter is very good and must have .........

4.0,"Its a good restaurant to visit. I went there on a Sunday and the service was excellent! The starter was tasty, the quantity of subzi was also good. Must visit place"
3.0,"Food was tasty, masala was mild and dishes were like home made. Service was not up to the mark, they were running short of table napkins and cutlery at 9 pm on Sunday, more than 3 waiters were attending us and hence too much confusion."
5.0,The food is amazing. The service and hospitality is even better. We ordered Paneer Tikka and kabab for starters. One of the best places to visit for veggies. Dipun and Rahman were serving us amazingly.
3.0,Not worth for money
4.0,Going Gaga for vegetarian place ? you can bank on this Z-Gold member. Great facade for awesome selfies is a add on  Must try potatoes out of tandoor.
4.0,"Great ambiance, good quality north Indian food. Very well guided by Padamnath during order placement.Quick order delivery.Enjoyed the food.overall nice experience."
4.0,Wow is just the word. The pure veg restaurant best for family and friends.. the best part is they serve Jain food too. Pani Puri is the best to start with panner kabab is their signature dish which just melts in your mouth. Price is on the expensive side. But I think it's still ok as the food does suggest to what u pay
5.0,Amazing ambulance and great north indian authentic food with friendly staff and exlent service.. we will back soon. .. ......... Spl thanx to dipun and sultan...
5.0,"We had a lovely time - authentic food, generous portions and perfect for a group. Recommend the lassi, the mango pickle and the thali is  really good. Guru and his tram really took good care of us."

5.0,Very friendly staff especially Padam Nath and very authentic food   This is probably the best North Indian restaurant in Bangalore .The dal makhani is the best dish I had
1.0,very poor food quality. poor service. Not good at all. Staff is least bothered about their guest's needs. Food is extremely distastful and too spicy
3.0,"1) food is indeed very good.  2) restaurant acoustics are very badly designed, gets extremely noisy. Cannot have a peaceful dinner and a low volume conversation.  3) staff is not very well trained. They all seem like they were working in college canteens earlier. We were 6 people, and were asked to sit on two tables joined together, on one side (on the sofa), since they did not want to provide chairs.  4) they ran out of napkins. When asked, the waiter asked us to use the paper napkins kept on the table.  Overall very good food, but the noise ruined it all."
5.0,Very very good service Mr GURU MR PADAMNATH MR SALMAN VERY GOOD SERVED  food also very very teste and very very much happy with all the variety of food
2.0,"Pretty much an ordinary taste, reading those fab reviews and ratings you would be expecting way too much - but I found it to be average, in fact the daal was not at all yum! V finished coz v were hungry.. Tats about it."

5.0,Excellent place to be with delicious food. Would like to acknowledge Mr Padam Nath for his services and the attention paid. Recommended !!!!
2.0,Food is not upto the mark as compared to others. There is alot of scope for improvement. The price of the food does not match its quality and quantity.  Could have reduced 1 sabzi and in place of that could have given a dessert. Also the freshness of the food was not there. Seems the ingredients used were of low quality or something else. The paratha given was not well cooked.It was raw while eating. The Paneer Tikka also smelled pungent. There was either no spoon or tissues given.
1.0,"Even after pre-booking for 1.30, had to wait for 45 minutes! Poor time management, please dont give the option of pre-booking if theres no proper process in place for reservations. Extremely disappointed"
5.0,Nice ambience and good food.The kadhai pasta is must try. Also the jalebi rabdi was authentic delhi style. Staff was courteous specially Padamnath. Overall a friend experience.Would love to visit again.
4.0,"Delhi Highway is newly opened in Indiranagar. The place is bright and well-lit. It is mainly a family restaurant. Ambience is warm and cozy.Music selection could have been better though. We tried the standard Panner Lababdar and Dal Makhani. Food is decent. However, I would visit them againfor the eclectic taste of their melt-in- the-mouth Tomato soup.                                                                 ...Read full post on letshavesupper.wordpress.com"
5.0,Excellent Service by Mr Padmanth. He was very courteous and made excellent suggestions. Really liked the food and service and the ambience. Must visit place
3.0,"We went for dinner to Delhi highway on 18th July . It was crowded, but they still managed to give us a sofa seat as we had an infant with us. The staff was busy because of the crowd and we had to repeatedly call them for everything. As for the food, we ordered Dahi kebab which was very average. For the main course we ordered Paneer tikka masala, Veg Karachi, jeera rice and tandoori roti. Service was a little delayed. And paneer tikka masala was very spicy. However portions were good. Overall , both the food and the service did not match our expectations."
5.0,Brilliant food. Amazing service done with smiles.  Great portion sizes. Especially try the dahi seekh kebabs starter and the paneer Lahori and paneer Dilli style main course dishes.
5.0,Superb place with very pleasant ambiance. Good food . Had good time spent with my wife. Do ask for Rehman . Very soft spoken guy. Would definitely visit again
3.0,"I like the ambience and food, but some how was not happy with the service. I ordered thali and The staff was trying to rush through the stuff. They in fact tried to skip one of the menu items. And later on they were serving but not with a happy face, so sort of spoiled my dinner."
5.0,Food is awesome. Specially thali. No species . Awesome food for North Indian . Restaurant staff is polite. But after booking also you have to little wait.
5.0,Awesome food and good service. Good for North Indian people. Lots of varieties here to choose from.  Must visit for North Indians. Highly recommend!
5.0,Padam Nath was very nice and served us with full heart. One of the best places for Punjabi food. Paneer and dal makhani eaters are recommended to be here.
3.0,Food was cold and gravy was not good and they can make food good also
4.0,combo lunch box was good except t panner   tikka which was hard and chewy
4.0,We are regular at this place as my in laws are comfortable only with Indian cuisines! The pain puri..aloo chaat..Dahi seekh kebab..Pav bhaji..khichadi..biryani are some of the items on the list which are worth a try. Nice place for a family especially!
2.0,"Delhi Highway is the only 'pure vegetarian' Indian fine dining restaurant in the Indiranagar neighborhood. The place was jam packed even at 7.30 pm which speaks highly of its popularity. But sadly, the experience I had, wasn't very pleasant.  This review is based on a one time visit. So I was there along with a friend of mine for a weekend dinner. I loved the ambiance, apt for a family dine out. The decor is all bling, done predominantly in hues of gold with glittery chandeliers which gives a very vibrant feel. Its a kid friendly place because there were quite a few of them prancing around when we went.  Now coming to the food, this is what we ordered- - Naram Dil Kebab - Tandoori Chipotle Mushroom - Palak Lehsuni Paneer with Garlic Naan & Missi Roti  The starters were pretty mediocre. There wasn't any flavour of chipotle in the mushroom. It dint feel like the mushrooms absorbed the flavour of the masalas. We got a hair in the kebab but the staff was sweet enough to replace it. But this shouldn't happen at such high end restaurants. The Kebabs were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, but pretty average. Thanks to the mint chutney and the raw mango pickle which made them palatable. The main course was a disaster. I mean palak paneer is a classic dish which was royally ruined. It had huge chunks of paneer which were hard in texture, it actually felt like raw pieces of paneer simply dipped in the gravy. The gravy was also bland, no flavour whatsoever. There was more lehsun in the garlic naan than the lehsuni paneer for the matter. Out of all the cuisines, I feel Indian food is the safest and can never go wrong. I have lived in Delhi for 4 years and sorry to say this was nowhere near to a 'Delhi' highway experience for me. I don't know if my order went wrong or it was just a bad day, but am thoroughly disappointed with the overall experience.  Service was decent. Staff was handling crowd pretty well. Pricing is a little expensive with respect to a purely vegetarian place. With one Zomato Gold our bill was around 980/-.  Bon appetit !"
3.0,Very limited quantity
5.0,Beautiful place  Waiting was for long but worth the wait  Exactly at the heart of indranagar  Lovely food  Lovely staff specially GURU did a very good job
4.0,If you have craze for North indian food then this place is must visit. We had tried for the thali and it was really good and for starters we had Pani Puri and that was divine. Even though there was a huge crowd we didn't have to wait for a long time for table. Staff's were friendly.
5.0,Great food and service. Padam Nath heightened our experience :) Definitely make a visit.  Paneer Tikka Masala and Dal Delhi Wala are our favourites and are must trys  Large portion sizes and overall delectable food
4.0,Firstly I loved the proper darbar kind of ambience that made me go to the place and try food there. Tried DH spl chole bature and pavbhaji... Chole bature was too good to try but not worth the cost. Same review goes for pavbhaji..but missed the authentic taste of pavbhaji.
5.0,"The palace is quiet good, plus the service of place is too good. Padam nath served us and it was one of the best service we got. A lot and lot of food and happiness!"
1.0,The food wasn't tasty at all
5.0,very tasty food highly recommended
2.0,"Had been there a month ago but able to recollect the discussions we had on the food. We were a large group of 12 people who had booked the table. It was raining and the folks kept on calling us as we were delayed by 15 minutes and driving across the city.  We were seated at the ground floor and was very neat and comfortable, however never gave the feel of a restaurant. The service was extremely fast and makes me wonder if it was already prepared. We had ordered tomato soup, which was very sad and some parathas. All the parathas tasted the same. The best thing was the chilli that was on the table for the parathas. It was super awesome, luckily saved the taste.  We then tried breads and curry ( was tasteless) . To end our dinner we ordered dum biriyani ( but no dum ) as it would take a longer time for them to serve and the waiting queue was getting longer. Its not expensive but lacks the punch of taste"
1.0,Food was fine but in an order of 1817/- INR they preferred to enjoy 102/- more by cheating - not supplying one missi roti. Not placing any future orders with them as they have lost their credibility. Cant blame Zomato for same as their delivery person was superb and very customer centric.
5.0,"Amazing place to visit with family, the hospitality, the one who served was so friendly, was really special . Must say, the food is next level. All the vegetarians must try this place. I have few pictures which was clicked. Thanks Delhi Highway!"
3.0,soup ws ok...compared to delhi highway's other dishes this one's avg.
3.0,"The food is awesome. Great service by Salman Hussain. Slightly pricy, but good quality food. Do try rabri and jalebi it is one of the best dessert"
1.0,"Heard this is a really good place for North Indian but I was disappointed. This restaurant does not follow standard practices: 1. Despite having booked a table days ago, we had to wait 45 minutes for one. It was a wedding dinner and it's unheard of. What's the point of booking a table then? 2. The manager actually asked those of us who had ordered the thali to sit on one side. We said it would be inconvenient for us to move again--yet he insisted again. This time we said no. Is the restaurant staff serving us or are we serving them?  The tomato soup was okay flavor wise but was too thin and watery. The masala Papad was absolutely the worst I've ever eaten - I couldn't taste salt or pepper.  The beloved dahi kebab and dahi/panner kebab were okay- nothing to write home about. The pani puri was okay- there was no sweet chutney in it.  The thali: the concept of a thali is a good one Surprisingly, after being disappointed by so many items, some of the items on the thali were good. The chole pindi and the daal were really nice. The veg biryani wasn't great though.  Overall not a very happy experience.  Thanks for the food."
5.0,The food is really delicious. The service guy rahman is very polite and served us with smile. Highly recommend place. The Diwali hand and langoor dal was very delicious.
2.0,"I booked a table of 15, couple of days back and well in advance in this restaurant. I even got a verbal confirmation on contacting them, couple of hours back before my reservation time. And we had to wait good half an hour to get a table which can accommodate everyone. It was an important occasion. And I booked table there as I was impressed by their food before. Let's just say they defoliated too much in last couple of months. The food was merely OK. Completely understaffed to handle in rush hours."
5.0,"We visited on a Sunday and the place was just filling up. The elaborate meal was La Jawaab, but the time it took to reach us for painful for the tummy."
4.0,Came here to catch up with my brother and the vibe and ambiance made the experience very homey. The food was decadent and loaded with goodness. Just going to take a second a mention the 'Naram Dil kabab.' So yummy! The staff was friendly. A special thank you to Padamnath and Rahimand. I would have preferred a better waiting system. Final word: definitely visit the place but pre book your table.
4.0,"Lovely place and lovely people serving you, particularly had a great time with the sweet Rahman and Padam Nath Amar . The dal delhi highway is to die for and the paneer delhi style melts in your mouth. Never disappointed in this place!"
1.0,I didnt receive the dessert!
3.0,"After trying for 3 times I got the confirmation, I seriously didn't understand why this restaurant has this much traffic. Ambiemce is great. Service is nice. Food, starters are good, Rotis and club kulchas are also good but the main course is not at all good. Ordered bhendi masala, It was too much oily, I literally had to squeeze the oil out of them to eat. Panneer labadar was just tasted like panner with thik tomoto gravey. May be I was expecting more for that price but I felt like not worthy."
5.0,"Been there once and amazing experience, we celebrated my parents anniversary there and booked table before in the morning itself.  We got lower ground big table and the staff was very polite and made sure best service though it was jam packed.  About the food, starters were good, served hot and authentic preparation. We end up ordering 5 slizzibg platter and all were yum.  Dahi ki kabab is must to try and in main course, dal, paneer and roti made it.  Staff was friendly and service was good."
4.0,Great place for Vegetarians. The ambience is what a typical family restaurant could have. The interiors and service was also good. Dal is a must try. Taste and quantity of all other items we ordered was also  good. Platter was good for starters. You can appease both your appetite and taste here.
3.0,The ambience is great but the food was a little disappointing. I tried the dahi sekh kabab and veg biryani which lacked the authentic flavour. The service is good and it's a decent family dining restaurant.
5.0,"very friendly staff, very good service. good food good ambience all staff were very good fast service had to wait for sometime but it's worth the wait"
4.0,"Ended up here for a team lunch and we ended up ordering the thali for everyone. The service while very courteous felt overburdened with the high volume of orders which meant a lot of waiting time that by the time the first round of starters were done, everyone was too hungry to care anymore and wanted the main course. The spread, the quality and quantity (unlimited) is a great combination , the kofta was too die for with their melt in mouth moments. The pani puri shots , jalebi rabdi were other highlights. The starters, the main course and the desserts were all top notch and great north indian vegetarian fare. Great for smaller groups. The decor is pretty heavy giving a tinge of royalty.  Service: 4/5Food: 4.5/5 Value for money: 4/5 X-Factor: 3/5Ambience: 3.5/5"
1.0,"The food is very ordinary with same gravy running in all curries, not worth the price"
4.0,Padamnath and Rahman were really helpful and guided us through the menu and gave great service..also the food is very tasty and the decor is nice
4.0,Locayed right in the heart of Indiranagar ..Lovely food lovely decor.. great service by Padmanath...loved the dahi ke kabab and dal makhani.. definitely worth a try
3.0,no gravy served with ghee rice
5.0,"Went for an unplanned dinner and landed to this place.....great place, great food and cheerful ambience......Staff is very friendly and prompt...specifically Padamnath..."
5.0,Awesome food we went for team outing. All paneer items was so fresh ans tasty. Ambiance was awesome . padamnath was very active to provide all the dishes thanks to him
2.0,"This was my second time at Delhi Highway. The first time Id went the restaurant was just a day old. This time I was disappointed with the service. The food was okayish as usual (I rated 3.5 last time) but it was the behaviour of the waiters that made me rethink about going to the restaurant once again. First we wanted to sit on seats with backrest but the waiter refused saying that since we were 6 people we could sit on a table with 8 seats ( this was when the restaurant was almost empty- only 2 other families were sitting) this was still okay but in the time we were getting adjusted the waiter got agitated and the didnt even give us the menus that he got for us and left. We could see him asking another waiter to give them to us. Then, fresh pesto kabas had a HAIR in it and we found out by the time we had already eaten almost all of it. When we told the new waiter he took the plate and went to inspect. Because we had already eaten almost all of the dish we didnt want a replacement but the waiter ordered a replacement for us without even confirming and when we said that we dont want it and asked him to cancel it one could see his frustration. In the end he didnt cancel it and we got six extra kababs with no one to eat them."
4.0,"Authentic North Indian food and they do full justice to taste and quantity. The place is very beautifully done up as well, loved the interiors and colours. Not sure if it was because of the table next to ours and the fact that it was a weekend but, I found the noise levels a tad bit high and the service slightly lacking. But it was good dining here nevertheless. If you're in the mood for some rumalis or panner butter masala, check this one out."
2.0,I've been here twice in last couple of months once for dinner and once for lunch. Taste of food (vegetarian dishes and breads) is good. But the rice always feel like undercooked. And the waiting time is huge. Both the times I had to wait for more than 1 hour to get my food after giving the order which is too much and that is the reason of giving it 2 stars.
1.0,"I visited the restaurant on a week day and even after making a reservation we did not get the table for 30 mins..post that while placing the order the waiters did not turn up to our table for atleat 45 mins after multiple attempts to call them..at the end we wanted to repeat the breads but noone came to take our order for a very long time..after 30 mins we finally places order..and immediately in 2 mins we asked him he could reduce the quantity as the vegetable was already cold..he replied by saying its already made and he cant cancel and made comments like youll are using zomato gold you cant expect us to cancel the extra order, as if it was a crime to have zomato gold..very dissapointed either service.."
5.0,This is one of the very few restaurants which serve North Indian in Indiranagar and they do it at their best ! Food was very delicious and very good ambience and good staff as well. Perfect place for family dining

5.0,"Food, ambience and service. Loved everything about this place. This place has an old mughul style setting and you wonder whether it's a restaurant when you enter this place.  The north indian food is mind blowing and I would put this up as one of the best places in Indirangar. Absolutely  recommend this for a family dinner."
3.0,Heard too much about the place and decided to go. Everything is oily and pretty much taste the same. The potion size is good. Staff is courteous and service is good.
4.0,"I visited the place with my husband for Dinner, the place was rushed but we didnt have waiting time :). Padam served us, fantastic service.. enjoyed the food and service !! Would need to mention Naram Dil Kabab which is a must try! On and on , family place and worth a visit and a re-visit !"

4.0,Booked a table via zomato app and it helped me. Dey held on to my table for 15 extra mts. As d kids were hungry v went for d masala papads and d starters like achari paneer and charcoal mushroom. Both were good and guru helped us go through d main course  with kulchas and panneer tikka masala dat was spicy. Dum biryani was too good. Delhi special lassi was d best among the lot and mocca mint was good for d kids as it a choco content. Overall nice experience and thx to staff plus guru for a quick service
1.0,"Accepted and cancelled a delivery order 2 hours after ordering it. Didn't follow up, I had to call zomato and then zomato called them apparently and they said order cancelled."
5.0,Food is very tasty. Padamnath was very helpful in selecting the right dishes. Kid friendly as well.  Charcoal mushroom and Jalebi rabdi are just try. Kadai pasta was average. Quantity was sufficient.
4.0,Ambience is really good. Nice place. Sizzling platter was the best dish we ordered. Nice caring staff especially Padam. The place gives a royal feeling with a Mughal look. Veg Biryani was ok not the best over here.
5.0,"We visited this place on the occasion of my parent's wedding anniversary and the overall dinning experience was excellent. The dishes were quite unique and definitely worth a shout out. But the best part was the service. Next time you visit this place ask for Rahman , and your day shall be made!"

5.0,Amazing food. Perfect quantity and great taste. Do ask for Rehman as he makes sure you ll never sit idle without food! Very satisfying lunch!
1.0,"Very costly and poor food quality. Being a person from delhi, this is not ""authentic delhi"" food. IMHO, this is a highly overrated restaurant which gets more credit than it deserves. On a sidenote, I also got food poisoning the next day. Coincidence? I think not."
5.0,"We ordered thali,and it came with welcome drink and yummy othentic starter,and the main course was really very tasty.it is worth of time and money spend ,I give 5* on ambience, hospitality,trational crockery and yummy food."

5.0,Food quality : Amazing Varieties : Interesting Ambience : Great Staff : Friendly Pricing : Reasonable  Waiting time : Minimum 30 mins  It's better to book your table online.
3.0,Good rated n very hyped Vegeterian restaurant. Their paneer dishes were pathetic.. it was saggy n blant. Their service was pathetic. They served us late n they were rushing us to finish our food quickly. Never recommend to anyone
3.0,"Delhi Highway is one of the few places in Indiranagar which provides authentic North Indian food experience as well as a good place for family dining.  Located on 12th main, Delhi Highway is built in a small palace like structure with intricate historical architecture. The place is built in 2 floors with fancy tables and chairs for seating. The waiters have a uniform as well. Beautiful chandeliers adorn the ceilings. There is a soothing yellow hue to the place.  Already visited the place twice. Had ordered Shahi Mughlai Paneer, Dal Tadka, Virgin Mojito and Aam Panna on the first visit. Dal Tadka was overly filled with Masala but Paneer gravy tasted amazing. Aam-Panna did not do the trick but Mojito was good. Roti and Rice were fine too.  On the second visit, I had ordered Dahi Seekh Kebab, Malai Kofta, Dal Sunehari along with Tandoori Roti and Jeera Rice. The kebab was very succulent and the texture was good, a little bit on the spicier side though. Dal Sunehari had proper North Indian taste and blessings my mind when mixed with their Jira Rice. Malai Kofta was fine with soft koftas and proper amount of sweetness in the gravy. For dessert, we ordered Shahi Tukda, which is basic the regular bread soaked in Sugar Syrup. Delhi Highway did a fabulous job by serving it with Rabri. Being a sweet tooth, I loved it.  Talking about the bitter part of the overall experience was service. They did not provide water to all the people seated even after taking order. They ran out of hand towels by 10 PM. Only one person was seen handling 4 tables and he was obviously rushed. The place is really expensive when one Tandoori Roti costs close to 100 bucks. Every gravy is 300 plus rupees. I was shocked to see their pricing structure when compared to the quantity they serve and the service they provide. Definitely not at par with the general standards.  All in all, a good place to visit only if you want to splurge a lot of money on the commonest of food dishes."
5.0,Spend a great time with my friends at delhi highway indiranagar in this sunday.. Attractive ambiance.. Too much of waiting. I waited 25minutes to get the table.. I was full irritated . Finally i satisfied with all dishes of food .. all food was really north Indian flavours.. Friendly staff.. Fast service..
5.0,"Such a nice place to have good Delhi wala food. Food is amazing. Prices are bit high, ambiance is good. Service is ok not too fast as expected."
1.0,"Having absolutely loved Tandoori Taal for its North Indian cuisine, we had hoped that this place would take it up a notch. But it turned out to be extremely disappointing. Tomato shorba we ordered was so watery, and tasted like Knor Tomato Soup. Dahi ke kebabs were undercooked and felt very raw, and didn't have any taste whatsoever. We ordered a couple of other things but nothing seemed to be worth visiting it once even with the benefits of Zomato gold. Can't argue against this place enough."
4.0,"Had read about the awards won by this place hence ordered their combo meal. I got 2 starter one dal, chole, non paneer subzi, paneer subzi biryani and raita. Biryani was ok. Starters were good. I really liked the subzi but the paneer subzi had like one tiny paneer piece with lots of gravy. I think more paneer pieces were needed. The star however was the rabdi I ordered (it was not part of the combo meal). The rabdi was just outstanding...I would have preferred giving them 3.5"
5.0,"Awesome food ,awesome service and beautiful ambiance.We loved the place..for sure will go back to have yummy north indian delicacies again with our friends and family."

5.0,"The place looks really welcoming from the outside. The ambience is as pleasing as the food is. Came here to use Zomato Gold, but the unlimited Thali does not consider it. The quantity given is enough to suffice the appetite. The people working there are very friendly and cooperative. The weekend Thalis have a wider variety than the weekdays."
5.0,"Nice food good service and hospitality by Padamnath, Rehaman and salman nice person and service by them very cooperative little items to be added in Jain menu"
5.0,"Waw amazing place Attractive ambiance. Palace interior with golden and white themes.. Food is really north Indian flavour.. My servers suggested me to moharaja thali but we ignore.. we ordered paneer tikka,naram dik kabab, dahi kabab,veg kadai,sahi mughlai paneer.. all the foods verry testy... sply naram dil kabab,dahi kabab and sahi mughlai paneer was fantastic . Service part was excellent.. Staffs are well manner.. prompts service.. wll back very soon for the amazing ambiance, nice food and excellent service.."
4.0,"Vegetarian friendly place with pleasant ambience. We ordered Tomato dhaniya shorba, Masala papad, Paneer Tikka Achari and Hyderabadi Biryani. The shorba was not so great otherwise the food very excellent. Hyderabadi biryani is on a spicier side so people who cannot handle spice should be careful. A perfect place to visit with your family and loved ones."

5.0,Delicious food!
4.0,Good food. Nice ambience. Padamnath served us the food. Prompt service. Nice ambience. Enjoyed the visit. Prices could be relaxed a bit. Felt it was slightly overpriced. Otherwise a nice place.
5.0,"The food is authentic Delhi style, good value for money. Unlike a lot of other restaurants options for vegetarians is great as this is a vegetarian restaurant. Went on a busy Saturday afternoon, service was good too. Would definitely recommend...."
3.0,"Highly rated for North Indian food. However, being a North Indian myself, the food didn't live up to my expectations. Average food but great service!"
4.0,"I ordered rabdi,taste was good but it should be less sweet and more thick."
2.0,"I had been there for Saturday dinner. Place decor is really nice n it's always crowded so if ur planning to go please book the table prior. When it comes to food it really sucks... I saw really good reviews about food n trusted the same but trust me nothing is worth neither taste nor quantity. We have ordered sizzling platter, Chipotle mushroom, paneer tikka and corn seekh kabab. Mushroom n planner tikka was over spicy.. We couldn't eat.. Platter n kabab were OK. For main course we ordered Malai kofta, pindi chana, spinach corn. Malai kofta was very very sweet the worst kofta I ever had in my life they should keep that in desert section. Pindi chana was too dry n no flavour at all Spinach corn was OK. For deserts we ordered gulab jamun, shahi tukda n jalebi rabdi. Gulab jamun is worth trying, shahi tukda was bit too sweet. Jalebi rabdi was OK.  I recommend you to choose any other restaurant if ur going for North Indian food. Service is poor. 2 rating only for decor."
5.0,The place has a nice ambience. Food is good. Book your table before coming as it get crowded after 8pm. One place of improvement is to add seating arrangement for people who are waiting. I recommend this place.
5.0,Have tried many dishes here.. loved everything.. amazing service by Mr. Rehman and others as well.. this is one of my favourite restaurants now
4.0,"1st week of June - Wonderful place with a great ambience...staff, very customer centric... however the effects of over spicy food, which we did point out ( was there with family ) took a full day before we got back to normal.Paneer tikka is a ""surely try"" dish...was one thing that we thoroughly enjoyed...  Last week of June Adding on...  This week's visit to this place totally floored me. Am a pucca non vegetarian...but a team lunch here, experiencing ""The Vegetarian Maharaja Thali"",was just so awesome. I move to a ""4"" from my earlier ""3"". One of those experiences when one realizes that veg food can be as lip smacking...Thank you Team Delhi Highway :)"
4.0,"Let me start with thanking courteous staff here. The person who took orders was so patient and was explaining in detail & helped us to choose. By the way we three friends met after a very long time. I booked thru Zomato & table was ready 15 mins earlier. We ordered Classic paneer tikka. Paneer was too soft and it was well marinated. Loved it.!! My friends took charcoal mushroom & they said was okay. I wont eat mushroom, so not much comments on it. We ordered sweet & salt lime soda, which was damn good. You may  ask whats special? one thing I found is the fizz was on even after 20 minutes, thats very  rare that I have seen. All of us felt almost full at starters, so we skipped roti & directly jumped to Hyd biriyani. Very nice -spicy, soft rice wit loads of veggies and paneer. Only golgappa was not good of entire order. We all Felt that Music was too loud!!  2 soup, 2 starters, 1 golgappa, 1 biriyani 5 lime soda!   Overall cost for 3 people with above items 2k!  Overall I say a very good restaurant for vegetarians! Would like to visit again and like to taste Maharajas Thali!   Food - 4/5 Ambiance 4/5 Price - expensive! But okay for one try! Staff - 4.5/5  Thank you!"
5.0,It was having some good starters and punjabi menu.  Amazing ambience and not too crowded as well. pure vegetarian people can put their hands on this without any discussion.
4.0,"Lunch with close family today at this pure veggie restaurant located at 12th main Indiranagar. They have a fixed thali which is aptly called maharaja thali as well as ala carte. While 3 of us opted for the thali the rest went in for ala carte. The thali first ...A glass of rooh afza with apple bits, stuffed papads, one golgappa and a dahi papdi chat with tomato shorba followed by the starters Paneer, aloo, dahi ke kabab,veg seekh kabab, hara bara kabab and one more. You can ask for more if you like. Each one tasted yummy. Next on is the thali itself...Roti and nan with 5 gravies...palak paneer, bindi curry, mix veg, chole and dal makani and a small serving of biryani with raita. For desserts gulab jamoon and Phirni. To round it up a small serving of khullad lassi...Phew !The next thing you would want to do is collapse in your bed for a siesta!!! The other items we tried out were the sizzled marae kulcha in which nothing sizzled but the kulcha and gravy tasted different and nice. The sizzling paneer platter was good too. Subz dum biryani was full of flavour. Phulka paneer and cheese tacos was innovative but heavy. The butter pao bhaji was nothing special. However the mushroom cheddar cheese was to die for. We also ordered a malai koftha which was jain style preparation. We ordered a portion of their gulab jamoon that has a stuffing if almonds and pista and the sugar syrup laced with saffron. Service was a let down to begin with...We had asked for a table for ten and were allotted a table for 8...They only managed to get us one more chair. When we asked for another chair we were told to adjust on the sofa...After this they managed the service piece quite well. The steward while taking the order warned us that a couple of dishes wud take a long time but to our surprise those were the ones that came first. Overall a great lunch experience. @ 600 per head it's decent value for money. Those who are strictly veggies throng this place. All the tables were occupied and we saw people waiting for their turn even at 330pm..."
3.5,"This place on 12th Main is quite a nice place for good Indian food. We went here on a Sunday, and inspite of booking a table on zomato, we had to wait for half an hour, which was quite disappointing. We ordered the corn and spinach soup and the cream of mushroom soup, both of which were good. The corn kebab and achari paneer tikka were also quite delicious. For main course, we stuck to rotis and a mix veg Sabzi, which were okay. We also had the gol gappe which was average in terms of flavour.  The ambience is quite striking and warm, but   I will say that the service is quite slow, we had to wait atleast 15-20 minutes to get them to give us the menu or place an order, which is quite irritating. I would recommend this place for the food, but the service is very disappointing."
4.0,"Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. An initial confusion with the zomato table ordering not going through properly.But the manager was quite understanding enough and ready to allot us a table shortly when we showed the booking confirmation at my end. Ordered the Thali for both me and my wife. Well, lot of stuff to try and would say had a very satisfying experience at the end. Good service and hospitality. Would definitely go back sometime again. Just one small thing that I can't agree with , here or anywhere, over-charging the water bottles (50/- instead of the mrp 20/-)..that aside, All the servers and managers deserve great appreciation for the effort they put up during the crowded time and still being patient and courteous in their interactions"
5.0,"1. Paneer Tikka (Jain) - fresh, tasty, succulent and generous in quantity.  2. Naram Dil Kebab - fresh, hot and generous in quantity. Not as tasty as a typical hara bhara kebab.  3. Jalebi Rabdi - Warm and crisp jalebis, tasty and generous in quantity with sweet rabdi.  4. Veg karhai (Jain) - Tasty, not so spicy and enough quantity for 3 people.  5. Peach Ice Tea - OK, could've been better, if prepared with chilled water.  Food quality and taste is good.  Food quantity is great, which makes it a great value for money.  Ambience can be termed good if you don't have noisy folks around you."
5.0,nice
4.0,"Had the Thali. Highly recommend.  Although the servings only come in one each, the waiters do indulge requests if you would like any of the items to be repeated. The makai kebab and paneer tikka were the highlights in the starters. In the main course, all the items were quite good. The gulab jamun given in the dessert was quite dense but all in all a great dining experience."
5.0,"Awesome ambience, service, people are very friendly and cooperative great service by Mr. Rehman... must try tandoori baby kulcha, dal makhani, lahori kabab, jalebi and rabedi, music is awesome"

5.0,Very well prepared food. Lots of variety. Naram dil kabab is a must try at this place.  Good service and very friendly staff. The decor is good with well planned seating arrangement. One of the best vegetarian restaurants I have been to in Bengaluru.
3.0,food was average.. went for their unlimited thali.. desserts were served with thali due to which it became cold by the time i had it... ambience is nice.. service was gud
5.0,Great food and ambience. Awesome service from Rahman. The Mozarella kulcha is worth ordering. Do give it a try. Discovered the place via Zomato Gold.
4.0,"Went here with family recently. It was completely packed. It's a purely vegetarian place and seems like it's one of the few only vegetarian fine dining places so I guess the crowd was not surprising. The two starters that we ordered were the highlight of the meal. Naram Dil Kebab and Tandoori Rolls with Chimichuri and Salsa. They were both delicious especially the Tandoori Rolls. Cooked so well and quite filling. The main course was the usual fare, Dal Makhani and a Mixed Veg, both of which were cooked well. The service was great as well. No complaints at all. The quantity was more than enough and 4 of us were completely full by the end of the meal. Good place for some vegetarian North Indian food."
5.0,"Great food and ambience. Naram Dil was superb. Good service too. Nice music. Every dish was just perfect. Value for money, given the variety, taste, service and quality."

5.0,"Great place for Authentic North Indian food. Have been here twice with my friends. They have never disappointed us on any thing. Everything that we ordered was at its best. Just one thing - waiting time before you get a table & waiting for service needs to change. Although I am well aware that its because of the crowd, but increasing your manpower should help overcome this."
3.0,Nice staffs good combos good for delivery responds quick to any inconvenience because I got a normal cold drink by mistake and they changed it I.e I had to call and complain
1.0,"I'm not a person who generally reviews restaurants, but the place is so awful that it made me write a review. First, the food quantity is so little, that even lilliputs would not be filled by the food. Second, the waiters not polite and have no regards for the customers. They just start throwing food at you. Finally, the wait time is so high that it make you feel like that time has stopped!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  I wish there was a option to give negative rating. I wouldn't recommend this even to your dogs!!!!!!!!!"
4.0,"Craving for some good North Indian food brought us to Delhi Highway. The ambience is definitely bright! But not off putting. Gold and blue. The menu has a good variety. They had a dinner buffet. A sit down one. Much better I feel coz it facilitates conversation. Otherwise everyone is just wandering everywhere with their plates! We started the meal with a strawberry flavoured drink. It was refreshing though a little too sweet. Soup was too watery. Disappointing. Then on to the starters. The Pani Puri and dahi aloo Puri were both delicious! The rest of the starters were yummy too. Especially the paneer and the dahi kabab. We were pretty stuffed after the starters but we ploughed on through the main course. The mains were really good too. About four curries, soft kulchas, flavourful dal makhni and biryani. They also served a sweet lassi but we were so stuffed we couldn't finish it. They also served a moong dal halwa which was nice, but would've tasted better warm. Really good meal. Make sure u work up an appetite before visiting though :)"
3.0,Not great taste. Very good ambience. Staff not aware of the food mentioned in the menu. They are expected to have knowledge. Prices can be better.
4.0,"Have been longing to try this place from a long time and finally got to. This place serves authentic North Indian food . The interiors reminiscent of the Mughal architecture and is a great selfie zone. Coming to the culinary part, we ordered paneer tikka for starters. Paneer was soft and succulent. Then we ordered some more paneer for main course, but this time it was paneer lababdar, the gravy was a tad too sweet and insipid. The service is swift and one does not have to wait long for their food.  The prices are northwards, so be ready to shell a few hundred bucks extra. But its worth the experience. Thanks to Zomato gold for offering a good discount.   Budget for two - 1200 rs"
5.0,I've been here twice. This place is perfect for family dinners. Great ambience. Lovely food. We had the North Indian thali here. All the dishes were great.
5.0,"Been there on Monday with my office staff. Normally i m pure vegiterian so i selected this place..we ordered and happy with this dishes dahi kabab,paneer tikka and one more very smooth tikki again main course paneer dishes and palak dishes test was very nice. really it was value of money ....  The most interesting part of this restaurant is its ambience which will take you back to Mugol time ... it looks like a palace .  Service : Staffs are nice and well manared will make u happy with giving fast and polished service ....  Ambiance-5/5 Food-4.7/5 Service-5/5"
5.0,"Though I m a had non vegiterian but i had to come here because of a vegiterian friends.. its a located in indiranagar 12th main. Easy to find.. the outer look is a palace.. inside interior is attractive.. we thought to go for ala cart. But one staff suggested to moharaja thali.. lots of options in that thali.. from chat,soup,salad,stater and finally main course moharaja thali all the foods are verry testy and quality is too much.. we r happy with thali.. service is verry nice.. staffs are friendly.. happy to see the manager attending to customer and asking about food and service.. thanx to delhi highway team for you great job.. will come back soon.."
5.0,"Was quite looking forward to visit this place on indranagar after going through a lot of reviews and recommendations  So visit on a weekend for dinner  To my shock it was packed. Luckily I had a reservation  So after a quick go through of the menu decided on the Thali is what struck me so went on ahead  Wow the menu of the thali goes on  So was served first a  Soup (tomato) followed by paneer hara bara kebab and veggies in hung curd roll  Pani puri dhai papdi chat  (By the way every thing on the thali is unlimited)  And last got a massive plate with four types of curry ( paneer, chole, veggies and dal )  butter kulcha and roti  Along with moong dal halwa Gulab jamoon and Dum veg Biryani finally to close it a sweet lassi  This just the dishes served now to the actual review  Pleasant food (not to spicy as I like) every dish was prepared well and seasoned to perfection did not have an issue with ( best to go on brunch ) dining setup could be better as a lot of crowd visit  Friendly staff could be a little more attentive because of heavy crowd  Highly recommend if you have the appetite"
3.0,"Not a great experience. One among those few veg place where you can go with family. Decent ambience. Good tasting food, so I meant not really great.  Service : Too down for the highly rated place. Service people were not attentive. Very casual staff, and needs a lot of improvement.  Pricing : Felt pricey when compared to the service level and ambience.  Ambience : Not really a darbar feeling. Cream color toned rectangular box with a thin crust cut out traditional interiors. They don't really give you that great sense of Richness. I recommend that the whole hotel needs more touch for royalness to come out.  You can be pricey on a starter and vegetables. But not on breads. I felt the pricing ratio is too bad there. Delhi food is known for its economical pricing, but it means out other way here.  I recommend to try this place, when you're with your family, looking for pure vegetarian place and and to be on a happening street."
5.0,"We came here for Mothers Day lunch. Apart from me, most of my family is non-vegetarian however due to religious reasons, we had to come to a vegetarian place. To be honest, I was hoping this place would live up to the expectations as I had chosen it. We booked a table in advance , and after  about 10 minutes of waiting, we had our table.  Rahman was our server and I must applaud his courtesy and warmth , his encouragement to help us try new food items and his going out of his way to create some items that were not on the menu.  For starters , we ordered dahi kebab ( tender, crisp, perfectly seasoned, dish of the day #1) , charcoal grilled stuffed mushroom , tandoori kebab platter and matar kulcha . The food took a little while to come , but was really tasty. The mushrooms were flavourful, the tandoori platter was superb and the matar kulcha was a reminder of Delhi street food.  After that great beginning, it was time to move to the main course. The standout item here was the mozzarella stuffed cheese kulcha, which was served with an incredible garlic oil. The stuffed kulchas with raita, paneer and mushroom curries with tandoori roti rounded this up, and a very good dal makhani accompanied it all.   The staff was courteous and got us a complimentary portion of jalebi rabri, which was a nice little touch at the end of a very satisfying meal.  Thank you Delhi Highway, we will be back soon."

2.0,"I am a pure vegetarian and had high expectations from here. The food is very average and the service is extremely slow. We had to literally demand for the main course to be served. The place looks very fancy but like they say, don't judge a book by it's cover."
3.0,"Very nice ambience and service. Pure veg restaurant. Good place for families. Fast service and decent taste. It's on a costlier side for the quantity they serve. Nothing very special though. Limited dishes. All paneer dishes tasted same. Food is on the spicier side so if you prefer less spicy, please do ensure to call that out when you order."

3.0,Very tough to locate through zomato.. but ambience 5/5... service 4/5...taste is good ..pure veg...not awsome.over priced and less in quantity but good ambience to spend time with ur partner...
4.0,"The first thing to notice when you land at this place is it's magnanimous facade and interiors. Full points in making you feel royal.  Coming to food, the taste was excellent for everything that was served. The kebabs were awesome. So were other items on the menu. This pure veg restaurant really nailed the taste buds of even the non veg people on the table. So kudos on a job done well.  For food the only thing that did not go well was the masala papad roll as the papad was already soggy. It looked enticing but it failed flat out.  Other thing that did not go well for our group wad the delay in serving the main course. Ideally that delay deserved a cut of 2 stars but I am giving a pass to them this time as I noticed they had a group of 40 to serve in parallel. But had that not been a problem you would have got a 5 star from me."

However, it has almost always tasted great. The mushrooms and paneer Kadhai bring me favourite. I totally love the ambience and it instantly gives a traditional North Indian feel. Its a must visit."
4.0,"It's an amazing place in Indiranagar. It was an impromptu visit by my team and we ordered for Peas Pulav, Butter Kulcha, Panner Platter and Langor ka Daal. Daal was just superb and Panner Platter is a mix of flavours of paneer and was just out of the world."

4.0,"The place again makes you have an ambient light and feeling that makes you feel you are in the court of Nawab in Delhi. Great food and amazing Drinks. Filled with varsities and courteous staff. Just can't get over the experience.  Best for family, friends and date night as well."
4.0,Outstanding food. Paneer tikka is one of their delicacies (extremely soft). Ambience is also decent : 3/5 Service is good. A must visit place
3.0,"It has a very royal ambience which would amaze anyone, the food out here is expensive compared to the quality and the quantity of the food that they serve. Also the food doesnt taste that great out here."
2.0,Didnt like: Long wait time and non attentive staff. Liked: Food was decent. I went with thali option which offered variety and unlimited option.
5.0,We came here for dinner date and were served awesome food by Rahman. The service was awesome and quick. The food was really good and Delhi style.must recommended for North Indians
5.0,Amazing food and ambience!! Totally loved it..It was a team outing for dinner and the entire team enjoyed the vegetarian food. Thanks to Rehaman who our experience a worthwhile and a memorable one!
4.0,"I go here exclusively for 1. Kesariya Phirni and 2. The paneer dishes. Both delicacies melt in your mouth, satisfying your taste buds. Cheers"
3.0,When I came across this restaurant I was thrilled to have north Indian food. We had ordered rajma rice and chilli paneer for dinner last night. I was eagerly waiting for food but was highly disappointed when I did try the meal. Rajma was very bland with runny gravy. Could not taste anythig except I knew I am having rajm.And paneer was lil dry. Having said that I would not want to discard this place. Will try it one more time wishing for a better luck to satiate my appetite.
2.0,"Ambiance is nice ...the food is decent but nothing great...Dal Makhni is very disappointing though their paneer dishes are amazing.....given the ambience of this place, the food was very disappointing."
3.0,gud
3.0,"Stopped in for lunch some weeks back. Decided to skip the thali and chose an imaginative sounding dish, whose name I don't remember now. It was primarily green peas in a pretty thick gravy. Decided to pair it with 2 different breads - a stuffed paratha and a plain roti. For dessert, I chose the drunk bread (dunked in a sweet saffron milk).  The dish was significantly undercooked and the peas felt like they were frozen, definitely not fresh. An imaginative dish was thus poorly executed. The breads were alright. And the dessert was very large and way too sweet for my taste - I could feel my blood sugar levels shoot up in dramatic fashion.  Overall, while the ambience was nice (very regal looking), as was the service, the food was wanting. And when one considers that I paid about 600 for this lunch, the experience was significantly sub-par.  Perhaps I should have gone with the thali. It would have been cheaper."
5.0,"Delhi highway was not disappointed me, food was awesome, pro light decor,service also with good manners,I just thought about the staffs how can they manage in Monday also so crowd, I have zomato gold but I didn't unlocked only for my servers, maksadul & rahman ,& they r very courteous staffs."
3.0,"After much speculation on the venue we decided on Delhi Highway. To start, a request for table from Zomato was denied, however after calling the restaurant we got our table for 14. Tip of the day: call the restaurant to book your table. Ensure you have a table reserved prior to entering the restaurant else be prepared to wait for a min of 30 min.  The supervisors and staff were very helpful and tried their best in keeping up to our requests. The kitchen will have to speed up cheffing out dishes or the waiting staff need to get moving faster. There is an avoidable delay from the time one places an order to the time food arrives on the table.  There is fusion food and its very good, couple of them  in particular pasta in makhani and kadai masala sauce, dal makhani is just too good, diwani handi can get some spice, masala and salt mix and can get simmered on low flame for 10min more, Gulab Jamoon was excellent.  A good place for a happy evening."
4.0,"Awesome ambience!! pure vegetarian restaurant with taste of typical delhi side!! I tried pav bhaji, dal makhani, matar kulcha!! dal makhani was too good staff are also too polite and friendly"
4.0,"Food was great and quanity was also enough considering the price which was slightly on higher side. We chose this place because of good ratings for veg food and we all were happy with all the dishes we ordered. However the place was heavily crowded and there was lot of noise. Many people were waiting for tables to get free and the crowd looked too much for staff to handle. Overall a decent experience for us, not awesome and not bad as well."
5.0,Food is delicious. The service is very good. Must visit place in indranagar for vegans:) The waiters are polite. Paneer is a must here with Delhi style lassi
5.0,just amazing
3.0,"The restaurant is grand from outside, but as you step in, the magnificent decor gives way to the poor maintenance of it. Food is not so bad, the dahi starter is a must try. Delhi Highway is worth a visit for all you North Indian veg food enthusiasts. For me, not again."
4.5,"Amazing place! One of the very few places who focus on making every element in their thali perfect. The splendid decor and service makes the experience even better. Our server Rehman, was very friendly and nice.  The only reason I'm giving this place a 4.5 and not 5 is because I them to amaze me even more, which they definitely can do!!"
5.0,"Awesome ambiance, pure veg food, dahi ke kabab were too good and we ordered it twice. Tasted Michi paratha and it was good. North Indian food with great taste, staff were courteous and helpful. Will plan to visit again."
5.0,Good quality
5.0,"Very nice food, Rehman and captain dipun were very courteous. Great food variety and ambience. Tasty food.thali starter chats were delicious"
2.0,"The ambience is nice but area was small compared to footfall. Overtly priced. For a chat it cost 325, that's huge, for 1 rumali roti it's 120 that's also quite expensive. But the food was good not that great. Attendants were courteous. We ordered paneer delhi style(can't remember the correct name) as recommended, but it had a stale flavor. With that whopping cost we never expected it coming."
5.0,Amazing dining experience. Loved the food . Service is exceptionally good. Ambience is suttle and beautiful. Would visit again. Good job team Delhi highway
2.0,"We had heard about this place a lot and after not getting a table couple of times, we managed to have dinner here. I'm going to list the two major gripes I had - 1. Noise. That's the first thing that is bound to hit you as you wait for the servers to notice your table. Something is just off with the acoustics here with other patrons' conversations forcefully giving you company. 2. Food. The chole was undercooked, took us couple of days to get our stomach back on track. The fusion quesadillas were good, the dum biryani was even better. The overall experience was lackluster, maybe thalis are the way to go but that's not an answer we're going to go looking for anytime soon."
3.0,"ambience is good. 4/5 ordered thaali. not a good experience though. welcome drink more of only cold water 2/5. chats ok 3/5, starters good 4/5. Desert good 4/5, lassi ok 4/5. thaali had 4 gravies, non of them was good 1/5. naan and raitha was horrible 1/5. service was good 4/5."

5.0,"Went here for my parent's anniversary and we were 6 of us. A bit of a bummer in the start because when I reserved the table over call, I forgot to tell them that I needed a table on the ground floor since my father is wheelchair bound. Ended up waiting for about 35 mins. However, the experience after that was excellent. The food was kick ass from the word go! Rehman the server deserves all the accolades because he took care of us like family. To such an extent that he changed my father's napkin and wiped his hands too. When you get such a service, how can you be disappointed!  Not to forget, the damage to the pocket was also suprising. Very affordable."
5.0,Pure veg authentic mughlai cuisine...very nice food and service. Ambience is a class. Quantity of every portion is too much. Really a very good value for the pricing. 5 star for everything. Special thanks to one of the staff named GURU.
5.0,"We were very delighted to find a fine dining vegetarian restaurant in Indranagar. The food is great and the service is good too. On weekends there is a long wait time unless you book in advance.Also, Mr. Biswajit Das of Delhi Highway is very professional and customer friendly. Overall its a very good restaurant, which we like to visit often."
5.0,"This is my second time at Delhi Highway and I must say that I'm sure to visit this place frequently. Right from the delicious food to great ambience to the most courteous and supportive staff, everything adds up to a great experience! Although it was a weekend, the manager and staff never bothered us even once regarding the time we took at the restaurant as I had previously informed them that it was a birthday dinner. This sort of customer treatment is definitely commendable and will stay in my mind for long. A must visit for yummy vegetarian food and peaceful dining!"
5.0,"Food is tasty n great ambience, got complementary drinks from Rehman. Paneer was so fresh and achaar paneer tikka starter found to be special dish."
4.0,"I went to this place with a friend and we ordered fulka tacos along with butter roti and paneer lahori. The fulka tacos were delicious, the ingredients, fulka and the cheese made such a great combination with salsa. Paneer lahori was quite good as well - the paneer was soft, and gravy was delicious. Apart from the food, the ambience and service were amazing too. Cheers!"
5.0,We went here to try the zomato gold membership. Food was great. Ambience was good tooo. Dipun and salman were helpful to us in explaining the menu items and making it a good experience.

2.0,"Other than food, everything is good. Not sure would someone give 4*. We ordered some starters,lassi & dal makhni and none of them tasted well."
5.0,Tried North Indian Veg food today. Taste was really good for Daal Makhani and Paneer Lababdaar. 4.5/5 for ambience 4.5/5 for food and 5/5 for Hospitality. Served by Rehman ... Courteous staff. Overall good experience
5.0,Best ambience... starters are very different and tasty... service is sooo good and they respond well... suggest good dishes... must visit for vegetarians
4.0,Amazing food - the paneer is to die for !  The service is rather slow tho  Took for ever .... a huge price tag but good quality food and quantity as well! The lassi was the only thing that did not meet my standards for a North Indian joint .
5.0,"Superb ambiance it was my first visit I was feeling like Haven specially thanks to Atish who take care us nicely. The place, where people can enjoy with friends, family, ..... Once again thank to Atish...."
4.0,"Good food, very good service. Rahman, who served us, was very polite and took good care of us during our visit. We enjoyed the food and the shahi tukda was exceptionally good. Will come back again, for sure."
4.0,"A very nice place for an Indian Cuisine lover. Food and service are really good. Mr.Dipun being our table waiter was at his best, a friendly chap who knows his menu in and out. Cheers."
5.0,First of all this is my first time visit to this place. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and ambience. Service was excellent and quick. Delicious food for the price. Used Zomato gold and it was a overall wonderful experience. Definitely recommended and will return here once again with relatives and friends.
5.0,Really good food and really diligent service. Ambience is extremely pleasant. Ideal place for a visit with your family. Will definitely be visiting again
5.0,"Delhi highway had us always on the wait list. Today we finally got a reservation! For starter we had the sizzling platter which included almost the rest of the starter menu items. So we felt we got a taste of everything. For the mains we had the sizzling matar kulcha, really soft parathas with subtle taste of matar in the side. The mozzarella kulcho was an absolute delight. It was accompanied by garlic infused oil and the combination was just right.  Dehli special lassi soothed all the spices that you just gulped. It had the right amount of chill and sweetness. The staff, Ahmed and Sultan were courteous enough to adjust their servings since we had an old man accompanying us."
3.0,"Food miss the spread which veg cuisines has generally in kitty. Honestly, it is paneer highway. The ambience is pretty Mughal but food offerings are generally punjabi.  I think, it needs little enhancing Menus. The staff here is good but lack the quality of handling rude people like my friends."
3.0,The place seems to be quite crowded and happening however our experience wasn't so pleasent. We infact return one of the chaat as it was so tasteless ... Others items were also ok but not heart touching.
2.0,"Overpriced to a good extent. Had travelled almost 10 kms for this place and honestly felt it wasn't worth it. Tried the tomato shorba/soup which was pretty bland. Had a potato starter which was again okayish. Had another pesto kabab which was delicious but was very oily. For main course we had a paneer sabzi which was again very much over priced. The quantity was decent for two people, not for three. We had tried the mozerella kulcha which was absolutely ridiculous. Very small in size and extremely pricy. The ambience is great, maybe a good place for the thaali. But for alacarte I would suggest find another place."
4.0,Very nice food....starters marked as must try were really yum...Dipun and Gayan were amazing in their service...great place to try North Indian
5.0,Such a great place. Order some paneer....it tastes like Delhi (I can say so being from Delhi). And Mr. Rehman is this great guy who is doing such a great job there! Thank Rehman for the the great service...I hope someone reading this actually gives you a bonus gift! Fyi: try getting a table reserved before going :)
1.0,"Please dont spoil name of Delhi and above all reputation of restaurants those are their on Delhi Highways....They are much better than your place.....We visited with family. We ordered 3 starters out of which 2 were ""marked as must try""......We didnt order further as we got shock from the starters itself...We ended our dinner their itself and proceeded for icecream at Milano which pacified our heat and anger over the food...Neither service nor food is great!!! Restaurant has footfall because of its location only, else i dare it will run!!!!"
2.0,"We visited this place for dinner after going through the good reviews this place has earned but were totally disappointed with the flavours.. we ordered 3 starters and a soup and since none of them tasted good, we had to struggle to finish our meal and we decided to skip the dinner.. Service and ambience is good but food definitely needs to be worked upon.."
4.0,value for money!
1.5,"Generally a decent place. But the experience today was nothing short of being pathetic. Firstly, when I called up for reservations the gentleman said ""No problems Sir. You can walk in"" But eventually I understood that they had not taken my reservation at all and had to wait for nearly an hour after reaching . None told us that Thali is not available on Saturday!!"
5.0,"after a long time...having authentic North Indian Food and it was amazing...the service is awesome and the staff are really courteous...Right from the Vallet parking we were made to feel comfortable.Especially,maksadul and Salman were awesome people...keep up the good work team."
5.0,Best Rabdi.
4.0,"So , finally I visited this place with my family and was super excited to have dinner at Delhi Highway because I had heard a lot of positive reviews from my friends and I must say it is indeed the best places in Banglore for North Indian food. As soon as we entered we had to wait for 30 minutes as there was long queue of people waiting before us which was little annoying. The ambiance is just beyond perfect and with a touch of royalty to it does make us feel royal too. The staff is very friendly and did give their best service. The staff gave us the menu and I was delighted to see the menu as it had unique dishes listed. We first ordered Tomato and spinach soup both of which tasted really good. For starters we ordered paneer sizzler which had different varieties of paneer and all of then tasted perfect. For the main course we ordered Dal Makhani and Malai Kofta. Dal Makhani was the best I had till date and Malai Kofta had more of gravy in it. For mocktails we ordered Blue Lagoon which wasn't that good in taste and Lassi was too sweet. Then, we ordered biryani which was perfect in taste. Overall , we had an awesome experience and would love to visit this place again. Cheers!"
2.0,"Food taste is no where close to the north indian food of delhi as the name suggests. The preperation is very basic. Neither is the food spicy nor is it masaledar, its bland . Except the ambience nothing is good here.  Food - 1/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 4/5"
5.0,The Langar dal was awesome..
4.0,"Good good, but too heavy for daily."
5.0,Restaurant is good and they serve amazing food here. Biswajit here has managed everything properly. Would highly recommend for north indian food whenever you are in indiranagar.
5.0,A high expectations visit to this outlet which claimed to be serving highly authentic Delhi cuisine being veg food naram dil kebab nice service and veg thile is very nice.... Raha an excellent service
3.0,"I stumbled upon this restaurant whilst returning home, from a nearby pub in indranagar. Ever since, Id been waiting to try this one.  I went on a weekend (Sunday) and the place was jam packed, as expected. The whole set-up is very enthralling and inviting. The staff were friendly and the food was really good.  For starters, I ordered the tandoori paneer. It was arguably one of the best panner Ive had in a while. I ordered the veg dum biryani for main course. Not the best, but still good!  The Delhi highway special lassi stole the show. You really cant complain how good it tastes. Amazing! Everything was fine until this point.  I ordered a plate of pani poori to finish off  what I deemed to be a satisfying lunch.  Apart from the taste, what disappointed me was, I found a stone in it. Yes! I actually did! I quickly brought this to the staffs notice. He was polite enough to admit it and offered to change the whole thing, but I refused. I was charged for it too, which was not nice but fair enough as Id eaten about half the plate.  It was quite unfortunate that I left with not a completely satisfying experience but, Im almost sure Ill visit again."
5.0,"Finally after 1 hour of waiting got our table, perfect ambience, loved the aloo tikki and the achari paneer, super soft paneer! Friendly and warm staff!"
1.0,"Poor service, every time, everything I had to ask twice.  Food just ok. Definitely not Delhi style .  Water bottle supposed to be on MRP as per gov rule. But 20/- bottle they charging 50/- when I said it should be on MRP, they said gov has given permission.  https:// timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Government-warns-of-fine-jail-term-for-selling-water-cold-drinks-above-MRP/articleshow/54860432.cms  Staff is not at all polite, feel like having food at local Dhaba."
5.0,Great dining experience.Staffs were very courteous and it's the best place to have a group lunch. Their Thali was very filling and definitely a must visit place.
5.0,amazing food !
2.5,"Well well the food dint stand up to the hype I had got.. quantity is terrible. We ordered food box which suppose to contain 2 appitizers , 3 curry plus Dal makhani , biryani rice , salad , paratha and raita. I totally agree that we received all these in a nicely packed box but what they need to mention is tat they will be sending all these one single piece of each ... Four spoons of rice . Honestly please increase the quantity. The starters were sweet , rice was bland and  curries were just ok. Not suggesting this place for food atleast ..."
3.0,they didn't send cutlery despite me mentioning it on the instruction. paneer was tasty. jeera rice wasn't. and roomali roti was the best
1.0,I had ordered Rabri and last time they gave a big box and this time it was a very small box.
2.0,"Very bad, poor quality and food delivered was not fresh.not value for money and would not suggest atleast to order.it might be serving better food in person but delivered food is bad."
5.0,Food was excellent. The restaurant called and informed when the food was ready and delivery boy took time to reach the hotel.
3.0,"First, non-veg lovers, this is not a place for you and so not for me but went with my family and friends (all vegetarians). Heard about this place and rating was also good (not sure how ratings are given, seriously). Let me start from Soup and end on main course. Soup was pathetic, we took spinach and corn and mushroom one. Looks like they just took boiled corns and grated it into fine liquid and added salt and some green color to bring the spinach feeling, definitely nowhere in taste. Cant call it Shorba also. Main course, we ordered Veg Handi, Panner Tikka Masala. Veg handi had complete raw vegetables which they changed with Dal Tadka. Now we were having two gravies which should have been named as Loaded Garlic Daal and Garlic Paneer Tikka. We have to selectively remove garlic. Yes I used We to confirm that it was not my single opinion. Never going again :("
4.0,food is nice but the quantity of food is less
3.0,"A high expectations visit to this outlet which claimed to be serving highly 'authentic' Delhi cuisine. Being a Delhiite, I took personal interest to visit this outlet and ended up being a bit disappointed. There is nothing so Delhi about the food here which was not even close to being called a Delhi thali. We ordered the buffet here and was served with welcome drink, then tomato shorba which was just normal tomato soup followed by starters including paneer tikka which was not spicy and not marinated either like Delhi. The corn tikki was average and they served dahi Papdi chaat which was good. The panipuri provided was only one in quantity and lacked the taste of Delhi's golgappas. The main course suprising to me didn't even contain dal makhani such a departure from typical Delhi cuisine and also had bhindi shorba which was the only good curry, the Pindi Channa was bland and nothing compared to the original, the veg kadai was spicy but not something we get in Delhi. The rotis were soft and the dum biryani rice was average. The desserts did not have any gulab jamun or faluda contrary to expectations and had Rabdi jalebi in which I don't know why Rabdi was yellow in colour and the firni had same colour. Apparently the bigger disappointment came when both tasted the same. The ambience is something which makes this place run and service is prompt and good. However, I feel if you are claiming to serve authentic cuisine that too at a high cost then food quality should be more than ambience as your focus which clearly lacked here. Ambience:4.5/5 Food:2.5/5 Cost:2.5/5 Service:4/5"
5.0,Brilliant food and Brilliant Service.  Great Service by Sunil. Looking forward to eating here again. Thanks to Sunils suggestion we had the Narain Dil Kebab and it was absolutely amazing. THANK YOU
5.0,The food was very good. The starters were the best. The fusion pav bhaji and pasta were very yum. The staff named Rahman was very kind. It is a very good place for families to come. We enjoyed the food
5.0,The restaurant is really good. Food is yum. Great ambience. Really good place to visit with family. The fusion pav bhaji and pasta is really good. Paneer starters are the best here. Rahman & Cpt. Tipun
1.0,Terrible service - I waited for almost an hour and half to get the food I ordered on my table.  Arrogant and careless staff who just nod and take your order and just run around tables but not get your order. I had to order same stuff to 3 different guys and one of them got it to my table.  Not at all value for money- Thali is totally not worth the money you are paying.  Overall just an average place with over the top prices for a below par food.  Skip if you can.there are better places around this place.
3.0,"Definitely not a 4.1 rating place, which prompted me to visit. The service is commendable, they try to move fast and give tables to everyone and serve you. So, my 3 stars are for the service. The food is not that great, the Kashmiri Dum Aalu was a little too sweet and the Aalu was not properly cooked. I could feel the crunch of rawness when biting into it. The Kadhai Haandi, was a little too spicy... The Paneer Platter, was better, but didn't satisfy. The paneer was soft and textured, but was not marinated well. The marination had not seeped into it, once we started chewing, it was just plain paneer. The place also, needs a little upkeep. I felt the staff lacked coordination..."
4.0,"We visited this place on Sunday afternoon where we had to wait when we called to reserve told to come directly yet had to wait   This is place has a superb ambiance, traditional mod decor, and pure vegetarian north Indian restaurant   Its the nice place for friends to hang out or family lunch or dinner   We choose al carte menu   Paneer sheekabab starters were delicious.

5.0,"Have been here almost 4/5 times in the past 6/7 months. You have to try the Thali here and enjoy the authentic food offered. It has a variety of starters, chats, indian breads, meal and desserts. This is definitely a must visit place. I have been to all the Delhi Highway joints in Bangalore and Chennai. Bon Appetite! @Delhi Highway!!"
1.0,there was an item missing from order...although taste was good
2.0,food was good but it took 100 mins for the order to be delivered. ordered at 8.30 delivered at 10.15 PM
3.0,"Went there on Sunday afternoon. It was filled to it's capacity. There was a thali option available but we went for A la Carte as we had zomato gold memberships.  Food - Tried Naram Dil kebab and Tandoori Chipotle Mushroom in starters. Naram Dil kebab was crispy with paneer stuffing. It was great. Mushoom stater was quite okayish. In Main Course, tried sizzling matar kulche and Kadhai Pasta. both the dishes looked very good in the way they were presented. Pasta was great while sizzling matar kulche was okay. Had keshariya phirni and gulab jamun in desserts. Felt that they had less variety in desserts. Even jalebi Rabdi which was in their menu was not available at that time. Both desserts were okay.  Ambience - It is one of the plus points for the restaurant. That's why it attracts a lot of crowd.  Service - It was too slow. May be they should hire more staff on weekends when they have too much crowd to cater."
4.0,"this place has a healthy and yummy veg thali, has two up and down sitting area,loved there canberry and orange gol gappe, and the rice in the thali was amazing"
4.5,The food was delicious and the service was also good. Chhole bhature and gulab jamun is a must try! The music was also fine. Overall a nice place to for dining with family.
4.0,Tasty! Offer discounts please.
1.0,The moment we said weve gold membership I dont know quality and presentation of food went off. Chipotle mushroom was not even close to a price tag of more than 300/-. I request restaurant to not allow gold membership if they are not comfortable with the discount a customer gets.
4.0,"Highlights: 1. Top notch ambiance 2. Very good starters 3. Average main course  To begin with we were astounded by the sheer grandeur this place cast on the road. A sight to behold! The interiors were rich and elegant with elaborate designs and subtle lighting on them.  Tandoori Baby Kulchas: These mini kulchas about the size of a big biscuit, was delicious with lot of spiciness and tang to it. But personally I felt it had a bit too much of garlic.  Narm dil Kebab: Crispy outside, and inside, as the name goes its very soft. I found it to be tasty and developed an instant liking to it.  Paneer Tikka: A frequently eaten item, this too was very good.  For the main course we tried tandoori roti, rumali rot and naan. Nothing to complaint about while the gravy, Paneer Lababdar had some major lacking in taste. On notifying this to the staff they modified it resulting in a slight improvement. This is where it lost marks, had this been fine, Delhi Highway definitely deserves a higher rating from me."
5.0,"Awesome delicious food, must try Jalebi Rabdi. Very considerate service, we received appropriate suggestions from the staff which helped us order right dishes to our taste."
5.0,"Ambience is very nice, courteous staff. Food is very nice. We didnt like bhindi do pyaaja and we told the staff, without a second thought he cancelled that. That much faith they have in their customer. When we told him to taste and then cancel , after that he said Jo aaplog ko pasand nahi aaya wo hmlog ko bhi nahi aaega. Impressed By the service.  Will visit again for sure."
5.0,"Went to the place because it had Zomato Gold. It is situated on 12th main, just a few minutes away from Krispy Kreme. The place is perfect for a family dine out, there is ample of seating space and has arrangements for group dinners as well. Coming to food, we ordered a kadai pasta and Hyderabadi biryani. The kadai pasta was pasta made with kadai paneer twist. It was a bit spicy and was more like a red sauce pasta but in kadai paneer gravy. The biryani was spicy as well, but it will fill your taste buds with various flavours due to vegetables and paneer in it. It was a great experience, the service was prompt and friendly. Would suggest one to visit for sure."
5.0,Fantastic and prompt service. Yummy food. This restaurant serves pure vegetarian food. The waiters are prompt and will do their best to ensure you get a wow experience. Google maps will guide you to this place accurately. Valet parking spares you the headache of finding a parking slot. Overall a satisfying customer experience.  Oh yes .. they are a part of Zomato gold membership so I got one dish free :))

5.0,Very nice food and polite staff too. Service is also quick. Great interior and ambience and well lit. Good choice for those wanting vegetarian food.
4.0,"Little head's up,I am huge non-vegetarian, Veg biryani equals Pulao claiming non-vegetarian. But in the recent times I have decided to broaden my taste palette, and hence a Vegetarian restaurant. So my review might be a little skewed, but I will try to be as unbiased as possible.  They don't take reservations on weekends, so if you are planning for a weekend visit, go early or have some time on your hand. Also a little heads up, the ""Vegetarian Maha Thali"" is not available for Sunday dinner.  This place is huge, with a very traditional, Old-Indian-Palace kinda decor. Extra points for ambience.  Let's jump to food straightaway -  Starters : We ordered 3 of the restaurant specials - 1) Dahi Sekh Kebab : Soft and Delicious, Full points. 2) Naram Dil Kebab : Wouldn't say good, it was decent at best. 3) Gol Gappe : Came in a beautifully decorated plate, with shot glasses full of colorful water. But alas, the taste was nowhere close to the pretty plating.  The portions were quite big, enough for 3-4 people. So, was quite full after the starters itself. Hence we ordered one main course and one dessert only.  1) Dum Biriyani : The smell was amazing and the caramelized onion on top looked deliciously inviting. I was not disappointed with the dish, but it had a lot of veggies which was a little bit of turnoff for me, but I guess that's normal with vegetable biryanis.  2) Jalebi Rabri : We had to wait 10 mins for the dish, but it was worth it. I could have eaten the rabri alone, the jalebi was just an added bonus. But that again would be taking away points from the jalebi. It was equally good.  *Special mention : Raw mango slices marinated in turmeric powder & salt. I just gobbled them up.Overall it was a good enough experience. There were ample service staff, all of them very helpful and courteous. Zomato Gold experience was hassle-free.  Here are my ratings for this restaurant : 1) Ambience - 4.5 [Very beautiful from both inside and outside] 2) Food - 3 for taste, 4.5/5 for beautiful plating. 3) Service - 4.5  For a hardcore non-vegetarian like me, even though food didn't amaze me, it didn't disappoint either. Giving this restaurant a 4.0 overall."
1.0,"So basically the whole family has fallen ill due to the terrible food, and the service is the worse I've seen in bangalore. There are small restaurants who have more polite service, the staff was rude and acted as if they were doing a favour, they did not refill water unless we asked then a couple of times.  The food didn't taste good, and the next day all 5 of us are fallen ill and have visited the doctor.  If you want good food, not have to visit the doctor and have a nice evening DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE."
4.0,"Ambience and service wise, it was a good place. Food was also typical north indian food.  We had Dahi wale kebab and papdi chaat as starters. kebabs were really good. For main course, we went for Dal makhni and paneer lababdar. Both of these were decent tasting dishes. Quantity is ample. They were really generous in the number of paneer pieces. Paneer was also soft. I had rumali roti and it was also perfect.  For beverages, I had jal jeera. It was just fine. They could have put more boondi in that.  Overall a good north indian food place."

4.0,"We visited this place on Sunday for dinner  Booking: They didn't take advance booking of tables, we needed to come and give our name and wait for an hour to get table. Not recommended if u visit place on weekend and can't wait for at least 45 mins  Ambience: This place has a beautiful ambiance for veg restaurant. However note this is a family restaurant not a party place  Food:  Soup ______ Tomato cream soup. This was below average.  Starters: _________ 1) Dahi ke kebab. this was amazing. Must order 2) Seekh kebab : This was decent in taste. 3) Pani puri: Fancy looking. I liked the taste, but it's like average pani puri u get on streets. Nothing special except looks  Main course _____________ Dum biryani: it was good. but not exceptional. Raita was a bit sour. smelled divine though. Made of fresh veggies. Average spicy garnished with roasted onions  Dessert: _________ Jalebi rabri: good and crispy  Quantity : All dishes are good for 3 to 4 people.  Zomato gold: _____________ No hassles. We used 2 zomato golds  Cost: ______ Efficient with gold. overall bill was 1500. costed us 920 after using 2 golds  Verdict: ________ I heard their thali is exceptional, however that is not available on weekends dinner. visit this place for team lunches in weekdays or with family friends on weekends if u are interested in eating good north indian food peacefully"
4.0,"Absolutely loved the place! Went there for a family dinner of 5 and our bill came up to only 800. Thanks to Zomato Gold. We three members had it. So we got 3+3. So economical! I am loving the membership!  The food was delicious! They have traditional food with an unique twist that adds to the taste. We ordered a paneer tikka, dahi sheek kebab and cheese kulcha. Though all the starters were yumalicious, I highly recommend the dahi sheek kebab!! It was out of the world! We had the Hyderabadi Briyani for main course. Which was good too. The ambiance is classy and rich. The service is prompt and courteous. So all in all a great experience :)"
3.0,I have gone to this place with so much of expectations but couldn't find it worth while because of taste of food is not so good. I tried their must try dishes but it was ok.
4.0,good
3.0,"we had ordered veg thali through zomato. The food was good, though the quantuty was less. There were 3-4 subzis, kofta and veg biryani."
1.0,shahi tukda -quantity of rabdi was very less...tasted like sugar syrup
1.0,Item delivered was not same what promised
1.0,Never got the order delivered by Zomato. No response from their Customer service chat
4.0,"The place is amazing if you want to eat North Indian Veg food. We ordered bhindi da pyaza , paneer lahoori , missi roti n dum biriyani. I loved bhindi da pyaza n missi roti , paneer lahoori was not that delicious as we expected. Overall food n staff are awesome!"
4.5,"Have visited here with friends, good ambience and food tasted good, In starters paneer and one of the tikki (yellow one)..we're not so good..hence giving 4.5, also lassi tasted good."
4.0,"Food box @99.00 was very good. Tasty, and yummy. I didn't like the Biryani much and quantity was less! But very good deal to fill one person.  Alacarte was expensive to order online  and eat. :D"
4.0,raita was too salty... rest everything was great
4.0,quantity was slightly less
4.0,food and spread is good but me and my family always find it quite spicy. assume that the majority of their other customers demand spicy food. overall good if you don't have a problem with spicy food.
3.0,the food was good but the items not complete..one started was missing..and buryani was like 2-3 tea spoon quantity
5.0,"2nd time i have been to this place and my experience was as satisfying as the 1st. Nice ambience, great service and fantastic food, one of the best north indian places in indiranagar"
1.0,bad food quality
1.0,Food wasn't enough for 12 year boy. All section on food box was not even half filled.  Only 2 tablespoon of veg biryani that was preparing in morning.  Completely cold food. Which on images it showing different.. Mani customers fool.
5.0,"A pure vegetarian place, was not very enthu to visit this place. I assumed it to be another north Indian place in Indiranagar. A friend recommended the food and I thought of giving it a shot.   The first time that I visited, I opted for the thali as I was lazy to order ala carte, and that was a good decision I would say. The one things that makes me go back to this place other than the food is the the chilli pickle. I always request them to pack a little for me ;). If you are really hungry do try the thali it comes with soup, starters, main course, and deserts.   The menu is good for the ala carte options too. Dal makhani, palak corn, and Lahore paneer is my fav. The quantity is good enough for the price they charge.   Have had a family get together with about 13 people and the bill for ala carte was about 6k with soups and starters."
1.0,The quantity and quality both were bad
3.0,"Ordered 2 food boxes and 1 paratha combo under exclusive weekend deal. Was disappointed on the portion sizes. Skimped big time on portion sizes for someone to have a proper filling meal. While they advertised 2 starters in food box, delivered only 1.  It appeared that it was paining them to put out food.  Guys dont offer such weekend deals"
3.0,"This place has a traditional Indian restaurant type ambience meant for families. We ordered a few dishes that included pav bhajji, which was extremely tangy as tomato was the only thing I could taste in the bhajji. Apart from that we had ordered stuffed paranthas, yellow dal and jeera rice which were all pretty average and nothing like proper Delhi food."
4.5,It was a surprise visit and the knowledge of it being a pure Vegetarian restaurant was a shocker to me. But even though me being a hardcore lover of non-veg liked the food here a lot.  All the items including starter and main course were out-standing from presentation to taste.  Only worry was Service Tax on top of GST... :-(
1.0,Got burnt parathas!!!
2.0,i went there with lot of expectations but i was disappointed . I ordered for Veg Thali .. in starters Dhai poori was yummy others are just ok.. maincourse was very average nothing extraordinary. 1 star for Ambience and other for dahi poori.
4.5,Food is good. Thali has a lot of options and tastes good too. Comfortable sitting space and nice ambiance. Cuisine is North Indian and tastes good. Prices are a little high but it is not very usual to find restaurant with such a variety menu.
5.0,very nice food and we'll service given by Sunil & Inder. snacks and main course which was served was very nice. We took unlimited thali. snacks were very nice from all of this. They have come up with new menu of chats and snacks and is must try.
4.0,Food was great. The dal was to die for. I am usually not a great fan of vegetarian food but after coming here I am sure I will come back again. Sunil and Indra were great.
1.0,The sweet is fully soggy and watery
5.0,I am fast time going for this restaurant there given  and nice food mr shathi nice service given for my friends very happy I will come next time thanks for every one....
2.0,"Food items were too costly ,taste was ok type.  As they serve only veg food it's costlier even than the non-veg food and which is way too high. Not only that they charged service charge which became obsolete after gst came. But when confronted they removed it from the bill. So please check your bill carefully. Apart from that, they did not pack the left over foods.As we could not finish the food we ordered, we asked them to pack them. But after coming home, we found they didn't give the items fully, only the gravy was given. This is utter nonsense.Please try to be little decent and honest to your customers. Most of the stuffs are not well trained.  Some of them are good. They try to be cordial."
5.0,Food is amazing and loved it. Atish and Dipun have provided excellent service... we just loved their service. We have had a wonderful experience
4.5,"1. Ambiance  I liked the ambiance  2. Reservation  I think they don't take reservation so directly you can go and waiting will be around 15-20 mins usually.  3. Food I tried  Since I am vegetarian, I can only talk about veg items.   I have ordered   In starters :-     a) Charcoal Mushroom (You can order Chipotle Mushroom if you like spicy food)     b) Naram Dil Kabab (I asked for Kabuli Kebab as it is written must try but the waiter said that it won't be that good so ordered this one, It is stuffed with paneer and cheese and it's bit sweet. It was ok ok for me, as I don't like sweet in starters and main course.  Main Course: -   a) I tried Hyderabadi biriyani as i wanted to have rice that night, but this is not the place to have biriyani  Desserts: -   a) Jalebi rabdi, I liked this one, go for it."
2.0,"Have gone to this place several times and the food is more or less good. I have go this place repeatedly due to its choice of fusion dishes.  However I had a horrible experience today because of the very bad service given by an argumentative and arrogant waiter. We ordered Masala Papad, Whole Wheat Fulka Tacos with mushroom, matar kulcha and vegetable kulcha.The Papad was soft, got maida tacos with paneer (instead of whole wheat tacos with mushroom) and matar kulcha instead of vegetable kulchas.  When I told the waiter that I had ordered mushroom tacos and not paneer tacos when he bought the food, he started dissecting my tacos to check if it has mushroom. I told him I will have whatever it was since I wanted him to stop dissecting my food. Turned out they were paneer tacos made out of maida instead of the promised whole wheat (which I had double checked at the time of placing the order). When I told they were paneer tacos and they were made out of maida, he told me self assuredly without checking that they were whole wheat tacos when the clearly weren't. He agreed to replace my food since they were paneer tacos and not mushroom tacos. He bought mushroom tacos (with a big sneer on his face) and they were once again made of maida. Fed up I only ate the stuffing. My husband later on ordered a vegetable kulcha and he was given a mutter kulcha.  Due to the horrible service given, when this chap came with the bill, I asked him to deduct the service charge and get the bill. In reply, he told me that we have to pay the service charge. I asked him to call his manager. Consequentially came a bill without the service charge...  Never coming to this place again!"
4.0,"Had amazing palak paneer at this place.. you will get the feel of a decent north indian restaurant. Good place to dine in, if you want to have North Indian food."
1.0,The Dahi Kebabs were awful!
2.0,We went to celebrate birthday and ordered Thali. 1. The waiter refused another serving of Paneer Tikka when asked. And the next serving of same was after 20-30 mins after 2-3 reminders. 2. The food items in the thali were cold. 3. The waiting time between two servings were min 15 min 4. The food being served was not at all yummy.  I was disappointed to have a family lunch there.
3.0,"Rare occasions when I opt for an all veg restaurant, and today was one such. Ended up here for lunch ( they are also listed on the Zomato Gold list)  We were welcomed with a complimentary Litchi drink.  Cheese Aloo Tandoori: Decent taste, would have preferred red a little more salt in it.  Naram Dil Kebab: Loved this  paneer based kebab. Crispy and is slightly on the less spicier side.  Dum Biryani: Perfectly cooked and good flavours  Palak lehsuni Panner: This felt a little too much palak, I missed the taste of the quintessential palak paneer.  The staff here are friendly and it actually looks really beautiful in the evening."
4.0,the rice was not packed properly.
4.0,very good taste
5.0,Had been here for my birthday treat with my family. I came here mostly for the ambience coz I loved it! But was pleasantly surprised with the quality quantity and taste of the food.. The curry we ordered was very flavourful. And the service was wonderful as well. All in all a very nice ending to a special day... :)
5.0,Really liked the food of this place and enjoyed the hospitality . Enjoyed the ambience and loved the service from Rehman .  A must visit for everyone
3.0,"Delhi Highway - I love the ambiance and the staff here are really good. But when it comes to food, we ordered Thali and Dum biriyani. Dum Biriyani was upto the mark and I love the starters and desserts. Do try Naram dil Kabab and Jalebi Rabadi (Your tummy might fill but you would like to eat more). Coming to the main course of my thali - This was a complete disappointment The Biriyani had a lot of salt and the Paneer sabji was burnt. I would surely go back to eat rabdi and dum biriyani but would never choose the thali again."
5.0,"A really good restaurant with excellent staff, service and food. Rehman and Guru, our attendants was really nice. Food was excellent. Excellent starters and amazing selection. Personally like the thali. The lassi and other drinks and chaat were exceptional and I highly recommend this place."
3.5,"Went here with some colleagues for lunch. I think the general rule here is the dishes which have Delhi in their name are good. The rest, not so much. We ordered the lehsuni palak paneer, Delhi black daal, vegetable karahi, sizzling platter, kabuli kabab and the cheese mushroom soup. The soups served to us were luke warm. Also the quantity was shockingly less.  The lehsuni palak paneer had extremely large pieces of paneer was rich but lacked some salt. The sizzling platter has exactly 4 pieces of everything. It was kind of funny like 4 tiny potato balls and 4 mushrooms, 4 paneer pieces. The kabuli kabab was great. The black daal was really good. So was the Delhi highway special lassi. I found the pricing to be on the higher side for the kind of experience this place offers."
5.0,we were at this restaurant for dinner. we had very nice experience and we enjoyed food and nice ambience. very nice service. one of the best pure vegetation restaurant in Bangalore.
5.0,Very good service  Yummy food  lassi is good  Should try the meals or thali Attish aur Reshmas service was exec lent Nice ambiance  good food good taste
4.0,"Was looking for restaurant and made impromptu plans to come to this place with my family and must say no regrets at all - great hospitality, yummy food, superb location.. Def visiting again.  Service with a smile and apt recommendations go a long way - special thanks to Rehman"
5.0,"If you are vegetarian and a fan of north Indian food then this is a must visit place for you.. Good food, great service. The variety of options gives u a difficult time choosing. But it's all worth it. It is slightly heavy on the pocket but definitely worth it."
3.0,"Seeing the reviews, I went all the way from J.p Nagar to Indiranagar, Last Week to visit ""Delhi Highway"", Seeing the name, I expected Dhaba like ambiance but its palace-like. Coming to the food, it was quite disappointing. We were recommended Lahori Kebab. it was bland & lacked flavor. We then ordered a Veg Hyderabadi Biryani. which was bad too. It dint taste good, lacked flavor & did not feel fresh. We then orederdfor Tomato Soup whickwas just ok. The Pricing is Exorbitant & complete injustice to Price to Quality ratio. The 3 is only for the Ambience. I ordered the dessert Jelebi with Rabdi which was also average. I would suggest this restaurant to use better Glassware to serve Beverages. Some of them have written that Food is Authentic. Nothing Tasted Authentic. There is a lot of Scope for Improvement."
5.0,lovely food and ambience. speacial highlight to the gentle and quick service - Rehman - thanks for the experience. must try - Malai kofta and jalebi.
4.0,"Went there on a Sunday afternoon. We had booked the table in advance but got late by an hour. We called up and notified the restaurant about it. They were courteous enough to hold back the table for us in the rush hours. We had booked for the buffet but ended up going for a-la-carte. Each item on the table was delicious. From starters Dahi ke kebab which topped the chart to Cheddar , starters satisfied our taste buds. Mocktail Watermelon Mojito was a mint cooler which helped us beat the afternoon heat we got on the way to the place. Did not much variety in dessert, so dint order any."
2.0,Went for Sunday dinner. Not find it as good as it is hyped. Except for prompt service we didn't find anything good there. Ambience was dull. Nothing like shown in pics. Food was nasty. Nothing as like compared to it's cost. We ordered all food items which were must try on menu card. But not a single item was worth. Very bad experience.
5.0,Excellent food  Fast service  Good ambience  Paneer is excellent it was very soft  I was impressed for the first time itself   Gollgappa is very nice -Rahman
2.0,"Surely not worth the price. Also being from Delhi I didn't think it id justice to it's name. We ordered naram dil kabab, paneer lababdaar and dal delhi highway, but none of us really liked it. Also the kabab's were actually tiki stuffed with paneer. I found Anand's sweet much better."
2.0,"the food is ok, but service is very bad. Had to wait for each item even when we only ordered their lunch thali. Though the thali was unlimited, the way in which the orders for second servings were taken and served it seemed like they were doing us a favour. In comparison to other restaurants offering unlimited lunch for similar price the service needs a lot of improvement."
3.0,"Booked a table through zomato , very smooth ! Got a table as soon as we e reached , the restaurant was jam packed. Service was good. We ordered for breads , cholle , dilli style paneer , subz fun biriyani , pineapple Raita , Masala Papad. Cholle was so so. Breads were good. Paneer had very less pieces of paneer , more of masala ! Biriyani was a disappointment since the rice wasn't cooked properly plus it was more of a tawa pulao ! Though I asked our server , dum biriyani is not supposed to be like this but made in dum with gravy in bottom & flavoured rice on top. But u can see the pics , to know the quality. They compensated tat with try free dessert. Overall was okay."
4.5,"Yummy food, great service and an even more amazing ambience. Can't ask for anything more for a lovely evening with your family.  The starter was just mouth watering.  We ordered the Naram dil ka kebab(paneer and peas Patty) which was absolutely delicious.  As main course we ordered paneer tikka masala, butter naan and Hyderabadi biriyani. All of it were just absolutely scrumptious! Definitely worth a visit."
5.0,The food is really nice with authentic north Indian taste. Ambince is great. Captain Dipun and Gyan are superb and make extra effort to cater guest needs.
5.0,Great ambience and delicious food. staff is very friendly and food was served quick considering restuarant was crowded. Staff person Rehman took special attention through out our meal by helping through menu.  would like to visit again!!!

1.0,really bad rabdi
5.0,Great service and they accommodated our special dietary needs. We also love that it is an all veg place. Viru Rahaman and captain dipun are great service
3.0,"I went to this place a couple of weeks back to enjoy a good plate of vegetarian food.The look of this place was like the Mughal empire and the decor of the place was great. We ordered the veg platter as a starter, different types of Roti and naan, palak lehsuni paneer and golgappas. The golgappas had 5-6 different types of water out of which the spicy and the mixed ones were the best. Food was good but not that special or great. Service was fast and the staffs were polite. Overall, I would give this place a 3-star rating due to the ambience and service.Food quality can be improved and more options can be put in place."
3.0,Just because I dint get the free goodies that was promised. Food tastes good. a definite try for vegetarians.
2.0,did not like the parathas.
5.0,"We came in on a weekday dinner thali. Everything about this place was amazing. Right from the dinner to the service was great. The person who waited on our table was Rahman and he was courteous and asked us for second helping for almost everything!  Suggest you try: dal makhani, Fusion food, chaas, gulab jamun!  Thank you for a great dinner!"
5.0,Wanted to visit this place ever since it opened. Finally went there yesterday without booking table and waited 90 mins in queue for a table but it was worth it! Ordered the thali and it won me over. Starters were just too good and loved the way they served pani Puri . Everything in thali was tasty and I enjoyed eating there. Will surely be coming back here again to try other stuff.
5.0,"The food is very authentic and tasty. Ambience is too good,with a very good taste in music.  Ar Rahmans service was top notch.  Paneer and seekh kebab was delicious."

5.0,Satisifing quantity and quality
1.0,We visited this restaurant based on reviews in Zomato and tried their so called Maharaja Thali. We were very disappointed with quality and taste of the food served. There are better punjabi restaurants who serve much better food.
5.0,"Yummy food with reasonable price, must try to have typical north Indian food. On time delivery."
5.0,The perfect north indian taste you get to eat in Delhi highway. Everything has a perfect taste from panipuri to panner tikka to malai kofta to garlic naan. Dessert : Delhi highway special lassi if you don't have it after the meal then just consider your meal to be an incomplete meal.
4.0,Made an improptu plan one evening after office and came to this place after looking at the menu in zomato. Ordered alu tikki chat and veg tandoori platter and those 2 dishes were enough to made our evening. Very sweet n tangy chat it was and the platter were so soft and filler. Rabdi and Jalebi as a desert helped us making to our mind to visit again. Such a pleasant ambience and friendly staff made the experience far better.
4.0,"Delhi Highway is situated amidst Bangalore city hub Indira Nagar. The ambience and decor is truly a royal-mughal type. Coming to food and service. Starters here were just amazing. We started with Dahi ke kabab which were okayish, Mix paneer Tikka Platter was delicious marinated with proper salt and spices, perfectly grilled and baked.  Coming to the most delicious starter, Lahori Kabab is a must try. Main course we had ordered some Paneer gravies, Chana masala and daal Delhi Highway. Everything except the daal was good.  Daal Delhi Highway had only flavour of Cardamom and Nothing! Need to improve on it alot.   Rating Summary : Service : 8.5/10 Ambience :9/10 Unique Try/Must Try :Lahori Kabab  Advice : Daal Delhi Highway needs loads of improvement."
4.0,"Ambience is very good. Nice music played. Went for lunch. Had their special thali. Food is awesome, served in very small servings. You can repeat the items as it is buffet system thali. Starters are very tasty. Main course too is good enough. The quantities served in Ala-carte seems to be very large in dishes as observed. Make sure if you visit, you don't waste food. Slightly overpriced, but quantity of food speaks for the price. Must go if you are crazy for good North indian food."
4.0,"Probably the only Pure-veg places in Indiranagar I love vising time and again. Expect some rush always here (even on weekdays). All the dishes I have tried here have impressed me , resulting in multiple visited to this place. Some must-try dishes at this place - Dahi ke kebab(amazing flavors), Sizzling matar kulche (served like a sizzler with perfectly cooked and gravy-rich matar), Rajma chawal and Chole Kulche. I am totally in love with thier rajma chawal, its a little spicy and reminds me of ghar k rajma cahwal. The prices are a little on the higher side but then to be fair, they do serve generous portions of every food dish. Trying their Veg thali is on my bucket list which I am saving for my next visit!"
4.0,Its the place for North Indian vegetarian food. Authentic taste. Great ambience. Delightful service. Portions are adequate. Naram Dil kebab. Rajma chawal. Gali paratha wali combo. Lassi. I am not paneer guy but naram dil kebab was something else. Mind blowing. Paratha was delicious. Rajma chawal was awesome. Lassi was delicious hope they could have been given a bigger glass. It was worth the wait. Has Valet parking else it gets really annoying in these lanes. Keep it up.
4.5,"Veg-only restaurant located at the heart of indiranagar. Tried their Unlimited Thali. Tasty and hygenic. They had few starters, soup, chats, a drink, roti, pulav, sweets and lassi included in the menu. Almost everything tasted nice. Will be pretty heavy to try out all the items. Nice ambience, comfortable service. Recommend this to all veg lovers around."
5.0,Food quality is really good the portion size could be improved and if dessert is added to it then it will be a complete 3 course meal.
4.0,Theyve got an awesome variety of food and Thali meals! The place looks quite classy and traditional at the same time with their service and taste of food being top-notch.
4.0,"awesome taste...they do the justuce to the 'delhi' in their name...did not have shahi tukda in bangalore like they gave...must try: kadai pasta, shahi tukda....and there are enough things on the menu...dont look at the empty ground floor and turn away...people are usually seated on the first floor..."
5.0,Excellent food suggestion and service by Dipun and Sunil. We went in the group of 7 and had tons of fun.   Starters especially naram kebab was good
5.0,"Sunil has given us an extra ordinary hospitality. The ambiance is very good. the best vegetarian buffet we ever had. Every single item is truly cooked to the best .. Lassi , chat , jamun was ultimate"
5.0,One of the few places which has really pretty decor. Came to Delhi Highway with my girlfriends for dinner. A perfect place to take your family for an amazing heart filling meal. Ordered for Thali which had all yummy North Indian delicacies. Served by Rehman who was polite just like the other staff members. All in all- a must try.
4.0,I ordered the food from this place and trust me am still Loving the delicious essence of good quality of food.. had sizzling_matar_kulcha & amazing food_box :) a definite love for best_taste food to be tried for sure \m/
5.0,"Family visit must for genuine food lovers. We took the thali buffet and it was amazing. Taste, quality and quantity of food is good. Original veg food of finest quality. A sound price of advice would be to keep your stomach empty before visiting. Nice, warm ambience and good crowd. Will visit again for sure."
5.0,"Food quality - 5/5 Food quantity - 5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4.5/5 One of the best paneer gravies I have tasted in Bangalore. Dum aloo was slightly on sweeter side. Awesome kebabs. I would love to be back here soon. however, there is usually a long queue so prior table booking is highly recommended. Also, there is no such private parking here."
5.0,"Amazing amazing experience here. I loved the place and the staff. Rehmaan was super courteous and it just made our day.Ordered two starters under Zomato Gold, one was mushrooms and other was paneer tikka. Just loved the paneer tikka here. They made some mistake and got us veggie platter instead of mushrooms but that was for our good. HahaI loved that too.Rehman, asked us multiple times what he should get more for us. ""Aur batayi sir kya lagwau"", typical Delhi style :). Amazing. He got us sweet lassi, kebabs and golgappas complimentary. Liked the presentation and food taste. 5/5 place. All this and we just paid a minimal amount. Great exp. Visited it second time today. Again super amazing experience. Tried Paneer tikka, veg kadai, gol gappe, and naram dil kabab. All 5/5. Kabab are 10/5. amazinggggg"
3.0,"Most of the starters in kebab are bland . The food is not great enough to match a half an hour waiting. The menu is very limited, lacks options. This place is overhyped among family goers."
4.0,"First of all, they don't have personal parking as mentioned. Secondly, we were on waiting list which should have taken 30mins but felt we being bachelors were kept waiting for more than the others.  Coming to the food part, we ordered Naram Dil Kebab which were crispy from outside; sweet and soft from outside as the name suggested. It was served with green chutney and Amla pickel. It felt so good to have Amla for the first time in Bangalore in last 3 years. Apart from that we ordered Palak Lehsun Paneer and Sizzling Matar. For breads, we tried Butter Nan, Lacha Paratha and Rumali roti. All of us just ranted how badly we missed such good food.  All the above was more than enough for three and so complaints about the quantity.  Keep it Up !"
5.0,The food was amazing.. and shahi tukda is a must try.. the ambience is also good.. overall a good experience.. the people out here are also good and quite friendly..
4.0,"well the waiting at this place increased my urge to taste the good food. Being from Delhi, I know the taste for daal making and dum aloo and I the taste here for these 2 was pretty good. will rate 4 stars for the food and a special mention for Mr. Sunil who served us the best way possible. 5 stars for Mr. Sunil. cheers"
5.0,Friendly staff. Good food. Kashmiri dum aloo and jeera rice is a must try. The staff is really patient and friendly. Sunil is the guy who was serving us and was really good.
1.0,Worst experience! All the dishes were cold and they were in a hurry to send us out of the restaurant to serve other customers. Taste was also very bad. Had high expectations but extremely disappointed.
4.0,Ambiance is good!!  To start with slow at taking order!!!  Masala pappad is fried here and not roasted...different yet good!!! Food  Worth the price ... Hospitality tats wat its the best at !!  Mamus service was cool and in time @ table T-26.  Must haves sizzling mattar kulche  Hyderabadi biryani
3.0,"Let's start with the ambience cause it's the best part about this place. A palace- feel, slightly royal, golden structure, very much family friendly (one of the few such places in Indiranagar). So 5 stars for that.  Service, again good. Not disappointing. Not something I would rave about.  Food though. We ordered naan and veg sabji and biryani. Sabji was between average and good. Naan was good. Very huge pieces (three pieces per naan). Biryani was disappointing.   However, I had a slight stomach upset the next day from this food. So wouldn't recommend because of that."
3.0,"Food was good but not great as listed in so many reviews. May be difference in taste buds. Tried paneer platter n dahi ke kabab for starter.. Dahi ke kabab was big disappointment.. Biryani was very spicy.. Main course was okish, nothing like wow. Had ordered paneer lahori, malai kofta, kali dal with naan.. Ambience and interiors were good.. Place is quite spacious.. Service from staff was excellent who kept asking for feedback about items.. One thing though i didn't like was insistence on giving rating on Zomato just after the meal from there itself.."
4.0,Delihi Highway - place can be rely on ! Went for Vegetarian Maharaja Thali and yes I'm delighted ! about ambiance : place can't be unnoticed by any one. about service : staff is friendly as well as service is prompt. about menu : many options to choose from. it is value for money place. must try maharaja thali. keep up the good work team delhi highway.
5.0,A must try place in IndiraNagar. Sunil was super friendly and courteous and made the whole experience even better. The food is absolutely divine and the place is gorgeous. :D
5.0,we visited delhi highway today and the food was really good. its a treat for vegetarians to dine in this place.it has a good ambience. we started with mushroom soup which was yum. The starters were very tasty . The service is excellent.rabdi with jelebi which was extremely good.
1.0,very less quantity
4.0,This is one of best place which we have gone till now . Food is awesome and sweet . Staff is very nice and ambience is awesome old songs . The best facility given by Mr Indra .
5.0,Great food and amazing hospitality specially by Mr. Indra. We had an amazing time on Saturday evening . We were a grouo of 15 members and everyone loved the ambiance.
2.0,"Dropped by this place at 9.30 pm for dinner with friends . We were told that there is a 30 mins waiting ..since we had heard so much about the food we decided to wait anyway. By 10 the person who was taking down the names had disappeared from the counter. My friend checked upstairs at 10.15 and managed to get a table for us at 10.30 by speaking for one of the waiters directly. After so much wait we were told it was the last order, we were given no napkins even to use, the food served was also cold. Honestly , poor service and average food."
5.0,"One of the best restaurants I have been to in Banglore. The staff is very friendly and the ambience is also very very good. The food is excellent, very very tasty. The quantity is really good along with quality of ingredients used which justifies the pricing. The quantity served does justice to the price of the item.  The thali option is also excellent with a wide variety of items. Thus restaurant is highly recommended for North Indian food lovers."
3.0,"Ambience + Great location on Indiranagar 12th Main. You can't miss the place. - Inside I found the decor ""over the top"" with the lightning and more so the choice in music.  Food + Butter nan was excellent. Recommended + The black dal was great. Recommended + Good sweet lassi. Very filling. - Paneer Delhi was too spicy and there was more a chilli curry flavour than Paneer. Not recommended - The rabri had a synthetic taste. Disappointed especially since i was expecting a North Indian restaurant to have good Rabri.  Overall This rating is driven purely by the Dal, Nan and the service of our waiter Dipun. Good service for sure."
5.0,"Awesome place, delicious food, wonderful family outing. Rahman and Pradeep were very courteous. North Indian food, starters, main course and yummy desserts. A must visit restaurant. Regards, Shashi"
5.0,Delecious Thali and good hospitality. The food choice was very good. Gulam jamuns were too good. Overall a great experience and would like to visit again.
5.0,It is set in a rustic ambience which has the capacity to take you on a royal experience completely backed by their service staff. we were served by Rehman and Captain Pradeep who was courteous and patient to all our requests. must go place for amazing vegetarian food experience.
1.0,"The staff and management wants customers who order a lot of things. If not they make there face small like irritated. Thali is worst thing at this place. I just asked for 2 butter naans, but they gave me 1 and the servers were ignorant. Alacarte - they serve good quality food but they expect us to order 10 items for 2 people. If u just order one curry n 2 naan, they serve carelessly. I need my 1000 back. The thali was worst."
5.0,Good
4.0,"Its a good place. Reminds me of Delhi. I wish the service was a bit quicker but the best part was Sunil, our food guide for the day. He when realised that we are getting a bit off the edge, handled it all pretty well and got us dessert too!!!!!"
5.0,Sunil has been really good in his service and very friendly.. Food was amazing and buffet is icing on the top.. Great place to be and enjoy veg meal
4.5,Sunil! Was kind... And the food was served well.and good..!! Thanks for the hospitality..! Recommend to come here if you need authentic North Indian food.
1.0,listen your food only had paneer ....wherein u have a lot of options in veg....please improve the quality of your food and especially paratha....that was so chewy that my head is still paining even after 2hours of having the food box....also if you throw that gulab jamun on someone that person may get hurt.....thanku
1.0,"This place has gone from great to really bad. Their food was stale. In the thali, the dalk makhani had foul smell due to some really fishy reason. When I asked the manager to smell it, he outright refused because he knew it was bad. I asked him to taste it, he didn't even touch it. He had the audacity to come back again and still tell me that there was nothing wrong with the dal and it was the smell of black dal. I told him I am born and raised in jorth India and grown on Dal makhani. Neither did he accept the mistake. Never setting foot in this place again, and will discourage everyone I know."
5.0,"Sunil's hospitality was remarkable. tasty food. thanks...made my day.. I had a paneer Chipotle which was outstanding. rice , daal and bhindi was remembering my home food."
4.5,"They are really awesome, good option for veggies. We ordered special thali which has verities. And the starters were amazing too. Also tried lassi which was good too. overall a great place for family outsing. Will visit again."
4.5,We went to this awesome place with our parents as they eat Jain food. The ambiance was super awesome and the service too was excellent. A special mention to the head of service Mr.Indra for taking care of my parent;'s requests and not disappointing them.  The food was of great quality and the quantity too was just enough to feed us four to the stomach.  Food:4/5  Ambiance:4/5  Service: 4.5/5 - The extra 0.5 for Mr.Indra.
4.0,Visited this place on Saturday for Lunch with my mom and without any expectations. The ambience is pretty good. Ordered the Thali and was pleasantly surprised. Its probably one of the best places for pure veg north Indian food in Bangalore. The appetizers were absolutely some of the best we had in Bangalore. The staff is very courteous and attentive. The Main course isnt on par with the starters but my stomach was full and I did not care much about the main course. We finished the meal with an awesome buttermilk. Overall very satisfied. Its a bit pricey for veg food (around 750 per head for thali including taxes). But I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good veg fine dining option in Bangalore.
5.0,"food was excellent , the paratha was soft and hot"
3.0,Bad food experience . Nothing was good. Don't order Dahi Shea kebab. Hydrabadi biryani was ok. Starters were bad and not much options. Will not recommend this hotel.
4.0,Tasty food..good service...spacious seating area..   Starter : ordered naram dile ke kabab..the paneer used was fresh soft. The kebabs were tasty.  Main course: ordered Delhi style panner. The gravy was flavourful and fresh.  Drinks: virgin mojito was good. Ordered Arabian drink which was not so good and overpriced
4.0,food was good
2.0,"I have been to this restaurant many times and I liked the food always but when I ordered paneer Delhi style (chef recommend) for home delivery, it tasted bad. why put mushrooms in paneer sabzi???? i would certainly go to this restaurant anytime for dine in rather than having food home delivered."
1.5,Not many options to choose from except for paneer and mushroom...and Im not a fan of either... It was an overdose of cottage cheese to the point of feeling stuffed
4.0,"Delhi Highway Restaurant in Indira Nagar, Bangalore brings the flavour of Delhi to namma ooru. It's a vegetarian place with a cozy ambience and good food ! Was here on a weekend dinner and it took us a good 45 minutes to get a table, once seated - service was quick ! Top Picks - Paneer Lababdar, Veg Karahi on the main course and Jalebi Rabdi on the Desserts !  Good variety on the appetizers too. Valet Parking is available                                                                 foodntraveldiaries.in"

3.0,"I visited this place on one Monday to have some new veg dishes try over here.. we had buffet in dinner,  Food: 3.7* As all food were good taste good look and quantity also fine but what I felt is like every dish contained some sweetness specially the tomato soup i really didn't like ? it seemed like red colour water which i'm drinking also few starters I didn't like such as mashroom, paneer..and curries were too spicy and full of ghee, because of those next day I was'nt at all fine as my stomach got upset. so would like to suggest what food you guys are making just take care of that which shouldn't make ppl indigestible. Ambience:4* Such a beautiful ambiance from outside designed like moghlai darbar . inside was also decorated with lights and beautiful velvet sofas which were very comfortable for sitting. alloy plates and glass and main course thali was well designed. services:4* well served , all workers are co-oparative and funny as well. liked it."
4.0,"The starters were good, the main course was average, but the drawback was that the food wasn't hot when served but it tasted good.  Sunil and Guru served us really well and the service was of top class, the place is well designed just feels like a king's durbar."

5.0,Had been here for Lunch. One of the best taste of Indian Style of food and Ambience. Food Served by Sunil & Team was excellent both taste wise and The way it is served.
4.0,Thali done right! I had ordered for the Combo Thali. Every item on it was exceptionally made! A Thali is incomplete without starters and salad. They took care of that too. I was happy to see that. Food: 4.5/5 Quantity: 4/5 Value for money: 4/5
4.0,Good food. Bit pricey
4.0,"I was worried about what to order when visited on the working days during lunch hours. To my surprise they had Thali concept which saved my efforts to select from menu.  Chat and other starters were tasty and you can repeat them as you like. it was followed by main course with bowls of curries, dhal ,roti , rice and naan.  Deserts were good and no place in stomach to finish it fully. Had very good north Indian food which is tasty and at same time economical for the varieties served.  Nice ambience , spacious and would be visiting this place more often."
5.0,"Great place for family dine out. Amazing ambiance .it's north Indian pure  vegetarian restaurant.  Food is mouth watering..all the food ,chat,pani poori decoration is good.

Must visit again."
1.0,Rabri being served as Zomato treats is full of custard..Delhi highway is fooling people..Delhi rabri is never like that..
4.0,Was craving for some North Indian food and found this place. I opted for a thaali and it tasted divine everything in it was very good and everything was pretty much dipped in ghee.From starters to the mains everything tasted damn nice totally loved it.
3.0,It's a much better place to go and eat. Zomato delivery is poor. 30 mins late and delivers the food cold.
4.5,"Good food, good variety of food. Good ambience. Leisurely serving. Family had a really nice  lunch time.  Sunil the guy who served us was very affable, forthcoming and did a good job. Thanks."

Realty I am satisfied this gentleman talking styles. I recommend to every vegetarian people please visit here. Its valuable of your money'.
4.0,"By far the best Indian themed restaurant I have ever been to. From the outside, it looks like a palace and the decoration, lighting and ambience, all sums up of to give you the Indian feel. I recommend booking tables before visiting this place as there is a lot of rush and you might spend a lot of time waiting for a place to sit. The menu offers a wide variety of north indian food, drinks, sweets but most of the dishes were overpriced. For starters, paneer tikka was delicious but the veg kabab didn't taste quite good. My friends and i ordered a variety of drinks, all looked fabulous, especially the blue lagoon, and all tasted good. Main course: Dal makhni was my favourite, simply loved the taste and was so perfect, along with tandoori roti and paneer butter masala. This is a place definitely to visit if you are mad about north Indian food. Sagar Sahni Manvi Bhardwaj"
4.0,"Good food. Great service. Good ambience. Tried their chipotle mushrooms and cheesy aalu for starters, both were extremely spicy.  Must haves- Paneer lababdar and their moong daal halwa."
4.5,"Went for the women's day special thali and have to say, we were seriously impressed.  Huge array of food to try and courteous staff had us exhausted with the amount of food we consumed.  Worth multiple visits! A must try for every north indian food lover!"
5.0,"Wow they provide typical tasty Delhi flavours on each and every dish...., Even I order lahori kebab twice just for the freshness and quality and taste I can't stop eating... Price is reasonable, very good service, trained staffs andgood ambiance. Visit this place if you love for north Indian food...."
5.0,"Awesome food, service and ambience . If you love North Indian food especially Delhi food and you are vegetarian then visit here is a must .  Great detailing in interior :- richness and quality of decor is an amazing with golden stones and lighting you will feel a palace when you enter the place .  Food :- really mouth watering food with proper balance of masalas it seems . The speciality of Delhi highway is their thali which makes you super happy , in this you will get everything all signature dishes of them from wellcome drink to lassi . The thali starts from well come drink , cone masala papad and shorba, golgape and chaat then they will serve 6 starters one by one , then they will serve you the Maharaja Thali which contains Dal makhani, chhole, paneer gravy and two mix veg gravies , Roti and naan then biryani, raita , salad , two desserts and at last Delhi special sweet lassi . Few of us ordered their most signature dish Delhi ka galiwali paratha combo which is a main course itself and don't forget to order jalebi with rabidi relay excellent  Service :- the staff are courteous and nice will make you happy by giving fast and great service . :- a must try place -:"
5.0,It is the best place to recommend. The service is really good and just loved the food. A very comfortable and luxurious place to sit and eat.   Please do visit with family or friends. Loved the place.
4.5,Fantastic food and service. Thoroughly enjoyed the holi special maharaja thali.  Pure vegetarian restaurant and the food course is pretty expansive. Entree and starters are yummy. Main course is okay compared to starters. Ambience is pretty good. All in all nice place to go for lunch dinner with family.
2.0,"Ambience was good and main course was not at all good, I was assuming there would be North Indian taste but was very much disappointed with sweet curry being served"
5.0,It's amazing ambiance with mouth watering North Indian vegiterian food.. specially dal makhni and desserts was fantastic test.. staffs are well manor & helping for choose the best dishes...
5.0,It's a great vegetarian restaurant in indiranagar area.. Where you will get authentic north Indian food.. Ambiance is like palace.. Service is quickly.. Staff are friendly.. Thanx to team Delhi highway..
5.0,Gujarati must have at this place the staff knows the language very well and Must try Panner Tikka and Lassi at this place and service is too good and they are too polite in serving
5.0,"Awesome food and wonderful service, not only veg food they make authentic Jain food also. Place to visit agin and agian. Maksaduak and Rehman are very wonderful person"
3.5,"45 minutes of waiting for getting the table definitely makes the expectations of a place very high. The ambiance and rich interiors added up to that but then the food couldn't live up to it. Paneer Tikka is definitely tasty here but dahi seek kabab are way too average. As for the drinks, fruit punch was decent. Blue lagoon seemed out of fizz. They should rename virgin pinacolada to pineapple lassi. Triple orange was like tropicana orange juice. Then comes the main course. Breads are overly expensive here and I didn't have much of the problem work the price of the bread but should be of that worth. The tandoori Rotis were like of any restaurant you take and rather small in size. Didn't find them worth their prices. Dal makhani is good. Paneer do pyaaza is also decent. It has too much of garlic in the gravy which I personally do not like as it overpowers other flavours. All in all I felt the place is overpriced for the food they are serving but I have to say the ambiance is great and hospitality is also good."
3.5,"Food is excellent - no qualms about it. However, the service is terrible. We had to ask for them to get the food. Even water was not served - so it certainly was a huge let down."
4.0,Positives: Excellent taste Nice ambiance. Good serving time. Nice music. Reasonable pricing given the overall package Decent staff  Negatives: Lots of waiting time.
2.0,Didnt not receive the Rabdi as part of Zomato treat.
5.0,Great and wholesome food.
4.0,"Great place for a good north Indian food. We ordered a thali as we were lazy to decide on the items. The thali is like a buffet, the food is unlimited but they serve on the table. Coming to the food, all the starters were really good. The gravy and other items were ok. But after enjoying all those starters you won't have much space to eat. Overall the it's a great place with good food."
5.0,"Amazing thali spread for Holi. Really happy with the service and ambience. Brilliant food. For improvement, I would suggest options in the thali range, as this one is too big for regular customers. No complaints on the quantity though!"
1.0,Food - 1.0/5  Ambience -3.0/5  Service -1.0/5  Must Try - I wouldnt suggest any dish here. Even a simple Paneer dish was very poor. That was the most disappointing part. And they served cold Parathas.   Clue - Poor food quality. Worst service as they have extremely rude staff.
3.0,"Good North Indian food in Bangalore..situated at a convenient location this highly spacious restaurant serves flavourful food somewhat true to north india..it was a delight to come across this place. Ordered roasted masala papad, tomato shorba, sizzling matar kulcha, Fulka tacos & Aloo parantha and all Potions were more than sufficient."
5.0,"Must visit place for NI food lover and Hospitality by Maksadul is awesome.Never tasted such good food in Bangalore and for panner lover must try and you can bite panner by lips,its so soft!!!!!"
4.0,"In simple words Great Ambience and amazing food  Went there wid my faimly  1. Ordered Paneer tikka platter  2. Dahi kebab 3. Charcoal Mushroom 4. Malai khofta 5. Dal Makhani 6. Rumali roti and tandoori roti 7. Anjeer halwa  Loved there Dahi Kebab , charcoal mushroom , malai kofta and Anjeer Halwa  Paneer tikka , Dal makhani and Rumali roti was average   Service was good too"
3.0,"At times having munched on non-vegetarian food the entire week, one cannot help but crave good solid homely dishes from restaurants like Bhartiya Jalpan and Delhi Highway. But my disappointment knew no bounds with this joint especially when it is rated a 4 on Zomato and apparently didn't live up to its name.  We ordered the paneer tikka platter for starters which was really good and I loved the pesto flavour. But then came the paneer lababdar which was so bland that you start wondering what the dish is. Is the creamy texture a paneer butter masala remnant? And where is the taste? Neither spicy, sweet or tangy, the lababdar falls flat and cannot be saved by the excess of onions in Veg Kadai. The loudness of the jeera rice is no relief and the only thing I ended up enjoy was the butter naan and amla ka achar.  Delhi Highway really needs to amp up its game. For disappointing food after a wait of 1 hour does hurt the sentiments of a foodie who had expected so much more.                                                                 anaffairwithflavours.wordpress.com"
1.0,"Had I an option of rating them in negative....I would have given a minus 5. They have lost their quality and their service is just so hopeless. I have no words to describe this place and food. - Disgusting is the word....  You reach the place and order a buffet which is termed as *Maharaja Thaali* which is apparently unlimited. Plz don't have any fancy imagination about the food.  1.The food is served too late  2. The time between one food item and the other is at least a minimum of 20mins...  3. In case you ask for another round of any food item, then forget it, because by the time it arrives, you would have forgotten that you actually ordered for it. 4. The staff is least bothered about what you ask for. 5. Our feedback to the management is hardly noticed..."
4.0,"Ambiance was beautiful, they had only veg food, the thali and the starter's easily fills two people, Goal gappa with orange and canberry wasn't going well with it, washroom was filled with mirrors,and they had a single Washbasin,they had two floors,down was with 3-4 table's and up they had more table's"
4.0,"Richness Richness everywhere! The unique interiors, the structure of the building all adds to the grace of this amazing place. I tried the following on my last visit here,  Delhi Lassi: Pretty Thick and well made. Would love more Pista in it though!  Sizzling platter: Pretty good selection of Paneer and veggies made in Tandoor Style( A good order i can say)  Naram Dil ke Kabab: Ah! The best Dish here i would say! Dahi ke kabab with a twist!  Tandoori Baby Kulchas: 10 miniature Kulchas served with desi garlic sauce! A dish made right for your taste buds! A must order.  Butter Naan and Butter roti: Very well made! Rumali Roti: Just pathetic, soggy. Worst I have had till date!(Coming from a person who would die for Roomali Roti) -1 here!  Paneer Labradar: It was extremely bad n bland. The person who attended us was courteous to change it according to our needs and get us a fresh serving completely. +0.5 here!  Overall a very rich experience as i can say! Prices are fine considering the posh ambiance. Service and staff are really courteous as i pointed out! They just need to work on the Roomali roti and Gravies!  Ambiance: 5/5 Value for money: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Staff and Service: 5/5"
4.5,"I was so doubtful that this restaurant will suck. Surprisingly, it was kickass! We went with my parents as my mother wanted to eat North Indian pure veg food. Ordered panner tikka, veg seek kebab, palak paneer, dal makhni and butter rotis. And the food was brilliant, with the melting paneer in the garlicky palak curry, with aromas riding all across my senses. A must have place if you are craving for some delicious North Indian food in Namma ooru."
5.0,"Food excellent and more importantly the people were extremely kind, helpful and nice... Grt time and food... Must visit with family and friends... Food still remains warm and tasty... Most importantly, staff is amazing... Nd food real real gud..."
4.0,"Wanna hangout with your family? Its a perfect place for having a scrumptious buffet..I have some special affinity for pure veg food..I ordered thali which comprised of welcome drink,starters,main course and desserts . Jalebi rabdi was enough to please the taste buds."
4.0,"It's a royal place with darbar like architecture. Looks really classy and best for families. It is pure veg. Service and ambiance is really good.  We chose unlimited thali which comprised of various starters, drinks, main course meal and deserts. Everything was delicious but I liked starter more.  It's worth visiting this place.  Quality - 4/5 Ambiance - 4.5/5 Staff - 4.5/5  EAT WELL STAY HEALTHY!!"
4.0,"Went to this place on a Sunday evening, the place was full, the waiting was of more than 40 mins. The waiting area was full, people where standing on the road, waiting in the car. I couldnt understand what the fuss was all about. Waiting for about 30 mins my table was ready, the staff took our order before hand so the food served quickly. The staff was kind enough to serve us a complimentary mocktail for waiting so long. My overall experience of Delhi highway was amazing. #food: 3.5 #service: 4.5 #ambiance:3.5"
3.0,"So myself and my husband zeroed down this place for Valentine's dinner. Since we both work close to Indiranagar and this place had quite a few good reviews and also that it had an option of unlimited thali, we thought this could bring down our burden of choosing from the menu since we both are not quite aware of the Delhi style cuisine. We were provided a corner table with beautiful ambience apt for valentine's. We were handed with a list of all the items from the thali.  We started off with a welcome drink which was tasty.  Then came the chat - Dahi puri and pani puri : Dhahi puri was the yummiest however I'd say your street side puchkas taste much better than the pani puri from here. Then we were served 5 starters - They tasted good  Finally we were served our thali with multiple gravies and Naan/Roti , a small bowl of biriyani, jalebi/rabdi and kheer. I must say we were not at all impressed either with the portions or the taste. Though they offered an unlimited serving of each dish, it would take them a long time to get back with our refills. Taste wasn't good at all of any gravy/kadi/kofta. We almost literally did not like/finish any of them. Jalebi-Rabdi was tasty. So, its overall an okayish place. I'd suggest Royal Andaz(We visited on New Years) on Mysore road for such north indian buffet for tasty and much cheaper food(500+tax)"
2.5,"We went for dinner at this place on 18th Feb 2018.  Ambience: 4/5 Main Course: 2.5/5 Desserts:1/5  We ordered masala papad, Dal Delhi Highway, Veg Karahi, Paneer Lahori, Tandoori Roti, Garlic Naan, ghee rice,  Gulab Jamun and Shahi Tukda.  The main course was average, garlic naan and veg karahi tasted the best out of our entire order. Ghee rice had too much of ghee, more than how much is required, with rice little bit al dente! Definitely not an Indian style of eating rice. One good thing, they asked whether we preferred fried or roasted papad for masala papad. Desserts were such a disappointment! They gave two Gulab jamun (for a hefty price of 180/-) which were regular sized, and usual taste, nothing exceptionally good to say about them. The Shahi Tukda had bread which had excess of sugar syrup in it, dripping out and mixing in rabri every time I cut a piece of it, and the ""supposed"" rabri which was served along with it, wasn't rabri at all, it was actually looking like a flowy custard! Didn't taste good at all! Can be visited once, I'll say."
4.5,A very pleasant ambience to hang out and good veg food to try out Must try naram dil kebab Staff being very kind and thankful to Mr Mukesh Kumar
5.0,The place is very good and service is also good.                 Jalebi and rabadi was awesome.           Interior design is good                            gol gape was amazing and I loved TBD place.

And I got my all favorite dishes with wonderful test..  And service is fantastic.. Specially thank to indar and atish.. They suggested all fantastic dishes and telk with us Verry poliltly.."
3.5,"Ambience is good with Mughlai decor. Starters were awesome but main course was not upto the mark. Though presentation of food was interesting. 1 of the down side for our dinner was regular power cut and there desn't seem to be proper power backup, remain seated long time with no power. Would like to give 1 more attempt this restaurant. Food 3.5/5 Ambiance 4/5 Staff service 3.5/5"
4.0,"The place looks swanky from outside and has valet parking so that is a plus. I was told that place is full on weekends but could see few tables empty on the ground floor, also seating looked less and a bit weird.  Soon i realised that seating is on the first floor asr well (somebody was waiting for table on first floor despite table was available at the ground floor) and trust me it looks like a different place, to its reputation the place was bustling. Snacks were good, Drinks were just ok ( Lassi was nice though) . Main course and dessrts were good too. Pls order sunehari daal and naram dil kebab for sure and watermelon mojito drink too was interesting . All in all good place with nice north Indian veg options"
4.0,"The food preparation here gives you a good time. You can actually get an authentic North Indian food with just one downside that it's only for vegetarian people. The starter platters are good here. Chole bhature were good too, although if you are from Delhi then don't expect much from it. The service was pretty quick."
2.5,"It is so nice to review different cuisines on a monthly basis and it is even better that one area offers them all. Review for the month of February 2018 is north Indian cuisine. Heard a lot about this place from Zomato so headed here with my friend. The a la carte menu sure is elaborate. We opted for the thali.  Ambience is pleasant without being OTT, soft lighting.   We were welcome with a litchi drink which was cool and delicious. And tasty masala papad. Heres what we had and my comments against each item  Soup  Cream of tomato soup - Okayish  Chaat:  Bhalla Papdi Chaat  Good. Can do with a little less sweet. Gol Gappe  If this one got an emoticon it would be a smiley and a thumbs up. Serves in shot glasses the pani was superb. We ordered round two.  Starters Classic Paneer Tikka  Cant complain Charcoal Mushroom  I like it and I dont.  Veg Shammi Kabab and Naram Dil Kabab  Awesome! Can have more of this.   Mains: Paneer tikka masala  Here we go again! Cant veg restaurants come up with anything other than paneer as everything? Paneer as starters, paneer as stuffing, paneer as mainenough already! That said, it was tasty. Veg Kadai  Very, very good! The best among the main course.  Pindi Channa  Average. Corn Palak  I returned mine but my friend told me it was blah! Dal Delhi Highway  Nope.  Breads Naan/Tandoori Roti  Nice and soft and buttery.  Rice : Dum Biriyani  Runnnnn! Ive never tasted anything so insipid. It needs to be taken off the menu.  Desserts Gulab Jamun - Good Jalebi with Rabdi - Good Delhi Special Lassi  Good.  To sum it up  Great starters. Disappointing main course. Nice desserts.  Would I go again? : For the buffet no. To try other items from the menu (snacks).. maybe. Service is good here.  Overall rating : 2.5/5  Ratings for reviews:   1  No! No! No!  2- Just about average. 3 Good. Can give it a try. 4- Great!! 5  Yes! Yes! Yes! And Ill tell all about it."
5.0,"i have been here for dinner and loved every dish. Paneer was soft, dahi kabab were delectable. Main course - daal was superb and so was mushroom dish.  Can anyone give me details of buffet please"
2.5,"My visit to Delhi Highway has mixed reviews. I did like the ambience but decor and interior was very basic... In between the meal you may feel a little dull... Talking about food, we took unlimited Thali costing @666/- per head ( valentines day). I liked starters and chaats but main course and biryani was horrible... all the curries including mix veg handi, malai kofta, pindi chana, dal makhani were too bad in taste that I could not take in even a spoon.. In desserts I loved kheer and their special lassi...  I would not like to visit further or recommend anybody here!"

4.5,"Must visit if you like north Indian veg food. We went on 2 occasions - as couple and as a big family dinner (20 people) The manager is very nice and he helped us in setting up the dinner for the whole family.  In dessert, do try Rabdi jalebi as well as Shahi Tukda. Food - all items are very well prepared, go for what you like. Ambience is like Delhi darbar, nice place to visit for veggie lovers. Not too pricey as well."
3.5,Situated @ right place n quiet easy to locate in Indira Nagar . This restaurant is decent in terms of the ambiance. Its not that spacious as somebody would expect with such rates .  Gives u fine service with wallet parking stuff .  I wasnt really happy with dal Makhini cause I really expected more !!   Chats were absolutely fine . But not the main course .

4.0,"A posh north Indian cuisine restaurant with a mughalai touch. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this place with its beautiful decors and lightings. Coming to the food, we had paneer tikka and dahi sekh kebab and both were just perfect with the perfect amount of spice and sweetness. Then we had paneer lababdar and veg kadai with garlic naan's which was just above average. Also, I tried the Delhi style lassi which was so good. I had booked this place with the flat 50% off on bill through dineout. I will be surely visiting this place again to try out their other dishes."
5.0,"Great food, great service and great experience all around. This is our third visit here and each visit has been better than the last.  The music is good, but can be a bit better."

4.0,The starters were good. I especially like the mushroom starter. Roomali roti was slightly hard. We ordered paneer and dal for main course. Both of them were also good.
5.0,Great Indian food. Never disappointed with the range of vegetarian food. Best place for a family get-together and get your hungry friends for the awesome thali
3.5,A good decent and clean vegetarian option in Indiranagar. Loved their tandoor delicacy. Their curries are equally good. We tried Aloo Punjabi on recommendation of the waiter which wasnt up to the mark. Service was prompt considering we were 20.

4.0,Food is delicious. I took the buffet and loved each item. Not much costly and must visit with family. Spacious so a big fat family can easily accommodate. People out there give you a good vibe and serve you very nicely.  One improvement would be with the speed I understand it was full on the day but a little faster service would be great as people had to wait for starters after finishing the first round. Would love to go again.
4.0,"Awesome service ,food is tasty,starters too many,paneertikki tastythe main course served very attractive over all the food and ambience is also nice"
3.5,"Twice in the past six months we planned to dine here but somehow it never materialized. Finally ended up here for a late dinner in a group of five. The valet was understaffed but we got seated quickly upstairs. Big open room with a ""Mughal"" touch and terribly busy as well full of large North Indian families. It's not very common to have appetizers, mains and deserts all good, but it was so here. Inspire of the crowd, the service was good (they replaced a soup we didn't like). Stick to the Indian dishes and you'll be fine. Only issues are the ambient noise and the lack of music."
5.0,"Good food, good quantity and amazing ambience. Not expensive at all. If you want to enjoy punjabi food in Bangalore, this is the place to be."

5.0,"In Bangalore, Being Vegetarian is tough task if you don't have equivalent options like Non-vegetarians in terms of ambiance, food, prices and above all staff service. So I found this Delhi Highway fulfilling all the criteria. Food is good so is portion size. Variety of options to everyone desire."

4.0,"Tried the Royal thali, it has combination of multiple items with soup, 6 types of starter, enough for main course and deserts. Overall value for money, really enjoyed Lahori kabab. Ambience is great and service was also quite good. Overall good place to try some delicious north Indian food!!!"
3.0,"Reached here on a weekend afternoon. Surprisingly, they didn't have any 2 wheeler parking. It has 2 levels of seating. Got crowded real soon.  We opted for the A la carte instead of the buffet. I felt the buffet was too expensive.  Cream of Mushroom Soup was just as expected. Masala Papad was average. Paneer Tikka Platter had 8 pieces of 3 different types of Paneer pieces. It was tasty and soft, but felt it was too overpriced.Gulab Jamun was good. Banana Split was quite filling.  Ambiance was just average; maybe ambiance is better at night. Pricing is on the higher side.   Service was pathetic. Immediately on paying the bill, we were asked to leave because of some customers who were waiting. This was definitely not expected from them."
3.5,Nice ambience. Food was up to the mark. Service was good. Flavors could be improved a little more. Overall good experience. Humble management.
5.0,Excellent food. The taste is very good. The spice was put in the dishes in optimum level. Overall a good experience. I opted for the hotel as many of the relatives gave a positive feedback. I think my decision was good.
5.0,Really good north Indian food. Went there extremely hungry but wasn't disappointed. Reserving a table is recommended but we only had to wait for 15mins.
5.0,"Rabdi jilebi was a great choice, juicy and lovely jilebi. Mixveg paratha was so soft and tasty.  Service was really fast and good  Overall very nice experience."
3.5,"Delhi Highway - A setup just as you would see in many of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's epic historic movies. The place has good ambience and you get a warm feeling with all the dazzling lightings as you enter. Reserving a table before you go up there is a better option as the place gets crowded in the evenings. We were a bunch of 4 friends and we all ordered Veg buffet which is served at the table. We were treated with Badam shorba soup, Cheese aloo Tandoori, Single piece pani puri, Papad chat, baby potatoes for starters and a small thaali with breads and veg dum biriyani along with Moong daal halwa and Gulab jamoon for dessert. From the soups to the desserts, they were all very tasty and mouth watering. The price of Rs.600 per head is a bit expensive considering the number of items on the buffet(all listed above). Overall the dinner experience was good, though I have couple of suggestions to the hosts. 1. Since the buffet is served at the table, It seemed awkward that we had to call the waiter each time we needed something more to eat. The food was brought to us only when the waiter was called and asked for. 2. Once we were done with our dinner, immediately the manager came up to us and asked us if we could leave as other customers are waiting. I understand their business, but I really expect some courtesy from them to just let us settle for a moment before we can all leave."
4.0,Good food!! Had the thali here and it was very good  which includes all varieties from soups chaats starters and main course... Good ambience too!! Very different...
5.0,"Very good ambiance, food is worth the money!! Service is very good!! A family friendly restaurant. Hyderabadi biriyani is a must have! And a vast variety of drinks.."

5.0,Excellent service and food. Sumptuous food with lot of variety in starters main course and dessert. We had Thalia and it was excellent. Good for family get togethers.
1.5,"We were one of the first few customers on a Thursday night. The food was okay. We had finished dinner and had asked them to pack the leftovers; they delayed our takeaway, informing us that someone had accidentally thrown away what wed asked them to pack. While they were ready to re-pack our order, we were asked to wait. So far so good. Then, the manager comes to us, and rather rudely asks us to vacate the table as he had other customers waiting and wait downstairs for our takeaway. We were flabbergasted at this behaviour and he didnt so much as apologies. As we were with an older person, we decided not to create a scene and left. But were never coming back here for sure, and will recommend giving this restaurant a miss, because of their insolent behaviour and pathetic service!"
4.0,"Went yesterday for dinner with my colleagues, beautiful ambiance. Service was good, staff were friendly. Food was excellent, starters were super, enjoyed all dishes. Paneer dishes were more, better to have some more varieties like aloo, Baby corn, sweet corn, gobi etc. Instead of both Naan & roti , would have added Pulkas. Desserts were good, could have some more varieties along with ice cream.  Masala papad, Pani puri, Bhindi & Jamoon was superrrrr :) :)"
5.0,Paneer starter was good.Good one ..ambience was good..A different one from the regular..Liked it..got to know this from my friend so came here
4.0,"We happen to visit delhi highway for Sunday lunch. Decent( more towards wannabe) ambience while you enter but it gets better after you are on table. We ordered Paneer tikka masala, garlic naan and rumali roti. Food was delicious. On the other hand, service was sloppy. Donno if the service guys are generally this lousy or this was some special occasion. Food quantity was sufficient but little overpriced.  A generous 4/5 overall ( mostly because food was really good).  Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Ambience: 3/5 Value for money: 3.5/5"
4.5,"Took the family out for lunch - food was great, service was terrific too! Went for the thali meal - Unlimited food - starting with a welcome drink, soup, papdi chaat, paneer tikka and tikkis. Followed by the thaali - which had black dal, chole, a paneed gravy, a kofta gravy and a veg gravy. All very good - rotis were good too. Dessert was moong dal halwa that I really like and gulab jamoons which I gave a miss - simply because I had to have another helping of the halwa. Overall very good meal. Would have given it a 5 point rating if they had paan at the end of the meal :)"
5.0,The ambience is really nice and the food is also superb... The tandoori mushrooms were amazing... Also must try is the jalebi rabri... Awesome place for veggie and jain people..
4.5,"Its located just 200 meters from 100ft road . Opened recently and specializes in North indian cuisines. We ordered ala carte and Dahi kabab stole my heart. Paneer gravy is rich in taste and not too spicy, Ambience is superawesome and thats the reason you see prices on a little higher side. I recommend this for  guys who are in search for really soul satisfying North indian stuff."
5.0,"I went here last week and it got Impeccable ambiance and the tinsel they have use for the place gives a great look. Also the best thing was I had the best service of all time, like whatever I was ordering was served in max 10 min  even on a weekend. The food was delectable obviously. They have all the veg item."
4.5,"A bit on the expensive side, but worth it. The ambiance is good, though a bit clichd. The service was good too.  The food was the highlight and that's why the 4.5 rating."

4.0,Delhi in Bengaluru !! :) Indo Mexican quesidilla was just awesome ... Softest paneer and rajma I have eaten after long time being in Bengaluru.
5.0,Very good quality food.  Mr. Indra was very hospitable. Tried the thaali and it was really tasty. The starters were also pretty good (specially the achaari aaloo)
5.0,"We went to Delhi Highway to celebrate our friends birthday that moments was unforgettable......  Thanks to Cp. Dipun and the manger Mr. Saroj who were really make our evening better....  the ambience was super cool, the food was awesome, and the service was excellent........  And we will be back soon..."
5.0,"Amazing ambiance, the starter we're good especially narmdil kabab and paneer Tikka was the highlight s.  The Allo kebab was ok.  And for the main course pibdi bindi was fitting properly to tandoori roti. Paneer was ok. Kesar kheer and gulab jamoon one was good."
4.5,It was an awesome decision to go for a dinner here. I am a pure non vegetarian but this place has made me love vegetarian food. All food were delicious and the amount of food was also good. Ambience was awesome and it was different from all other places. I loved the hospitality and the people over there are really professional. It's a good place to go with family and vegetarian people will love this place for sure.
4.5,A very authentic place once u step in with a very good ambience and yummy food. The food will give authentic North Indian taste . Yummy sizzler as starter and roti and Malia kofta and butter paneer so all in all a very stomach filled dinner !! Must try
5.0,"Great food and very friendly staff, enjoyed the dinner thanks.please keep it up, authentic Punjabi food is served in a great ambience and place is quite spacious"
5.0,"Looking for North Indian food, youve reached the right place. Delicious food, awesome ambience, amazing service. Highly recommended place. Starters are amazing, must try chaat, lassi and gulab jamoon. Mr. Rahman & Mr. Pradeep were very courteous.Regards, Shashi Ranjan"
3.5,Great service.. staff is prompt. Good north indian food but can be improved. The papri chaat was superb but the gol gappas definitely need to improve. Tandoori items are great too.
3.5,The restaurant has really nice interiors and is well maintained. This is one of the attraction of the restaurant. Apart from that their food is also good. Their gravy quantity is good enough to fill 3 people and that is worth the price. We ordered delhi style paneer and it was amazing. Within no time our order arrived and it was delectable. Their service is quite quick and good. However the mushroom soup we ordered had a very poor state. It tasted and looked like perished milk with burnt mushroom in it. That was nowhere near how a soup is made. Otherwise their north Indian food is delectable.
3.5,"You have various versions of Thali and they have theirs.  Its not a buffet, hence all the starters to mains is served on the table. Very few options in the tandoor incase you are stickler for healthy food.  The service is good. With so much on your plate there is no space for mains in your tummy. So be ready for overeating or already inform them to serve less of starters.  The desserts are part of the mains as it is in case of Indian Thalis.  An experience."
4.0,One of the Very few Vegetarian Restaurants in Indiranagar Serving Authentic North Indian Food . The Ambience is on par with any other Fine Dining Restaurant and Courteous Staff as well. Had the Thali for Dinner which contains a lot of variety from Fresh Starters to Rich Desserts .
5.0,A fine family dine place with Excellent cuisine with really good hospitality!! Reservations a big must..and a must go place in Bangalore indranagar..
5.0,"Amazing hospitality ..,Food was yum , staff was very friendly .!!  Must visit with family , I am sure u would love this place . ....!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,I don't remember me giving any restaurant a poor rating but this one deserved it. I don't have any beef with anyone working here but the staff should seriously be trained to handle customers who speak their mind. Food was awesome and this is coming from a hard core non vegetarian. I would love to order online buy I will not go back there ever. I will speak of a few instances and let readers decide. Service was slow as a snail. When people come to eat its because they are hungry and not in a mood for gossip. Second when we asked for repeat of some dish the disgruntled look on the head waiter s face told as if we had asked him for a favor. The killer ending to the never ending instances were they forcibly putting something on my friends plate when he clearly told he didn't want it signifying the fact its a full plate u have to take it whole whether you like it or not. I have been to countless restaurants and had never encountered such a behavior. Maybe if the management is reading this you should seriously consider grooming your employees to serve customers better. As they say a good service can make up for crappy food but a crappy service will never make up with good food.
3.5,"First thing, it's almost always crowded. So book a table. Ambience is good. No music, perfect for a family outing. Service is very prompt. Waiters have good knowledge about the food they serve and are very enterprising. Item wise review....... Tomato Shorba- Disappointing. Very watery, no flavour. Dahi Kabab-Great taste, good serving size Methi and Panner Paratha Combo- Well made. Served with accompaniment. Enough for one person. The black Dal was very tasty. Panner Lababdaar- Not upto mark. The gravy had excess masala and was grainy. Paneer however was super soft and fresh."
5.0,"Though I am a hard core non vegetarian but I had to come here because of a vegetarian friend. The location is very easy to find and it's located on a quite place. The outer look is fantastic and same goes into the interiors too. We thought of going for alacarte but then changed our minds and selected the Thali. Now, the decision clicked well and the options in our plate were good in numbers as by seeing the plate only we looked at each other :DStarted with guava juice, paani puri and masala paapad. All were good. Now regarding thali, paneer items, green vegetables and cholas were awesome in their own way. The Indian breads were also good. I requested some changes in the ingredients of pani puri and it was graciously accepted and was changed for me. This is highly  appreciated.  VFM - 4/5"
4.0,"With the grandeur of a palace, this place has an incredible ambience. To add cherry to the cake, the food is tasty and sumptuous as well. Being a veg-only place, the sheer variety and creativity in some of their dishes is mind boggling. I would highly recommend the fusion dishes; in particular the whole wheat tacos. The service is prompt despite the usual weekend rush."
3.0,"1st day of the year and we decided to have lunch at Delhi Highway. Having heard about the place from a few others, we were excited and extremely hungry. There was a wait time for 20-25 minutes. What disappointed me was that they hadn't informed us that only thalis are being served and they aren't taking orders for a la carte. Nevertheless, we decided to go for it. The food was very very average. The ambience looked like they had tried to make it grand but mixed in a little jazz which made it very weird. The service was very slow, maybe coz of the new year crowd. But the staff is accomodating, so I'll give that to them. I would not give them points for value for money. 750 bucks plus taxes for their thali was not worth it. I would suggest AB's or Rajdhani for this price. Now, this is going to be a very long review because I want to do justice to everything I tasted.   Mosambi Delight - Some very green syrup mixed in water, topped with tiny pieces of lime. Pathetic.  Roasted Papad - This was nice, especially when eaten with the green chutney. However, the masala (mix of onions and tomatoes) inside was a little bland.   Tamatar ka Shorba - Warm and soothing, but bland.  Dahi Papdi - This was the best among all. Perfect taste. They had put in the right amount of sweet and spicy.  Pani Puri - Very disappointing. The filling was a huge fail. The puris were a little soggy. And the Pani was nothing great.   Kasturi Paneer Tikka - Again, very bland. Could've been marinated in a better way.  Tandoori Cheese Aloo - This was a fusion gone wrong.  Veg Chingari Kebab - This was soft and melting in the mouth. A must try for all those spicy food lovers.  Naram Dil Kebab - This one was my favourite. It was a twist to the dahi kebab with a crunchy outer layer. But I found a few peas inside, and couldn't figure out what was the need.  Harabhara Kebab - This starter was good too. Not better than the harabhara kebabs I've had elsewhere, though.  Makai Kebab - I liked this one too. It was very soft and scrumptious.   Paneer Matar Masala - Nope, not tasty.  Pindi Chana - This was something which tasted good in the beginning but left a very weird after taste, maybe coz they'd probably put in cloves.  Veg Chop Masala - Very different, full of greens and yum.  Dal Delhi Highway - This is your usual dal makhani. However, this one was a little watery and did not have that creamy texture and thickness.  Veg Raita - It was sour. Asked them to change it. And it was still sour.  Butter Naan - The usual.  Jalebi with Rabdi - They served this with the main course when it should've been served at the very end because it got cold by the end. And, it was super sweet.  Delhi Special Lassi - It was too thick for a lassi, not beaten properly which is why I had to use a spoon to devour it. But it tasted really really good.  Food - 2.5/5 Service - 3.5/5 Ambience - 3/5 Value for money 2/5"
5.0,Awesome food and service... Very optimum price... Good family restaurant.. nice ambience to sit and enjoy the food... Overall a nice vegetarian option around the city
4.0,"If you ever have craving for north indian food and you wish to treated well .. this is the place my friend . Starting with the ambience of the place .. i felt that it had a very royal ambience and the place is well lit so good photos which is a yay ....  This is how my experience was .. i talked to the manager for a few minutes booked a table and waited for around 10 minutes which is okay if you are visiting on a saturday :)  The manager was very sweet and addressed us very nicely which i really liked ... Now coming to food .. i did not come with a lot of expectation to be honest but the foood was on point.  Chaat:  We ordered chaat papri : which was a bowl full of papri and all the good things .. i would say the best chaat i have eaten so far in bangalore ..  The dahi in the chat had a perfect taste which is always a miss sometimes at places either its too sour or its bland which i dont like but this was perfect.  Must try !    Starters:  Naram dil kebab : which was crispy on the outside and soft from the inside , it had hints of elaichi..   Mushroom chipotle : I really love mushrooms and this was very well prepared ... it was marinated well and filled with paneer on the inside and was on the spicier side and i really liked it ...  Main course :  By this time we were king of full but we thought of trying out few of their  main course food  Paneer lababdar : it had huge chunks of soft paneer.... trust me on this but the paneer was really soft and well blended with the gravy .. the gravy was very thick and rich in taste .. it was not spicy at all .  Hyderabadi biryani :it had a lot of veggies and few cubes of paneer .. it was very spicy and the taste was really good ... it was a veg hyderabadi biryani was good ... it was very well prepared .  Breads :  Lacha prontha and butter naan : both were good.   While we were eating the person serving us brought 3 smalls glasses of sweet lassi and said it was complimentary for us : which was very sweet of them to give ! The lassi was thick and had the perfect amount of sweetness .. neither too sweet nor less sweet .   All in all i would say that this place is a must try if you love good food and good hospitality ...  I would like to apreciate the people who served us they were very patient and well behaved !  Will surely visit this place again !"
5.0,"Delhi Highway,,,,,, is the one of the best vegfriendly restaurant in the city which is located in 12th main , Indiranagar with a gorgeous ambience which looks Like a palace . Food that we ordered sahi muglai, Dal makhni, Roti and misi Roti , Dum biryani in main course all those were amazing. Even though we tried dahibhala papdi chaat, paneer tikka platter and golgapa also nice and house special . Finally comes to dessert which made our day that is Jalebi with rabidi really really good ....must try this place, with family and friends."
3.0,The paratha was burnt
1.5,"The food's good, but you have to stop overcharging customers for bottled water. The aquafina bottle has Rs 19 as MRP and has not been procured through special channels. I was charged Rs50 quoting mineral water. Since my kid was beginning to get cranky , i choose not to confront this issue . But the good food was simply undone by charging excessively"
5.0,Visited this place on Christmas Eve. They had a special buffet planned and not to exaggerate it was amazing. Buffet meal started with watermelon mock tail which had a very unique taste to it and was star of the meal. It was followed by dahi papdi chat and pani puri. Later we tastes kebabs of 5 types .Cant rate on quantity since we tries only buffet but for sure this is a must try place which reminds you of Delhi right here in bangalore. Even waiters are really friendly and asks you of your choices while giving space as well. Good job guys !
5.0,"Was fed-up with daily daily non-vegetarian food, finally planned and tried Delhi food at Delhi http://s.vmate.com/MvBvevrUezHighway for pure veg food and really it was more than my expectations which came true.  Food : 4.5 / 5 Service : 5 / 5 Ambience : 5 / 5  We tried their Maharaja Thali which is really worth and delicious especially pani puri , chaat, starters and jalebi with rabidi which are outstanding really we enjoyed a lot..... Must be recommend ...."
3.0,I'll keep my review crisp since the other foodies have done a great job on the details. Overall it was a decent experience for me. The ambience was nice with great music and service was prompt. I found the food on the spicy side and only a few hit items. I wish it would've be more tasty on the palate. The portion of food served in the thali is more than for a single person (post the starter's) Price is on the steep side and valet parking is available.
4.0,"Been there for a team lunch and was satisfied with their ambiance and food that was quite apt for a team gathering. Place was both cozy and comfortable and has adequate space for a good sized team sit-together. Food was not something extra-ordinary, however it won't disappoint you either. Hospitality of the staff was also good."
1.0,"Pathetic experience while ordering food from the restaurant through Zomato. Initially the restaurant accepted the order, but after 40 minutes when the time came to deliver the order, the restaurant just cancelled the order without providing any explanation."

4.5,very delicious thali.value for money and its unlimited... authentic north indian taste.loved the food.Deserts were ok ...starters were tooo good...paneer was very soft and fresh.Curries also very tasty.
4.5,"One of the best vegetarian places in Bangalore for North Indian cuisine. The starters were lip-smacking, and the main course gravies were delectable. I liked their paneer. They have kids friendly menu as well. The breads felt just right and we're very soft. The Jalebi and the rabdi were fantastic. Overall we had an amazing experience.

3.5,Dis place z amazing if u r a vegan.dey have few beautiful starters like dahi kebab which just melts in d mouth.d ambience is like that of any mughal building.a bit expensive but quality of food fixes that
4.5,"We reached there at 7:30 and after that we started with lacarte and 2 thalis. The starters were superb Dahi seekh kabab and Veg Kabab were very tasty. From the thali, the starters were awesome, panipuri, dahi puri were good once. Now comes the main course, you will not be able to stop your hands even if you do not have enough space in stomach.About the desserts, gulabjamun was yummiest and lassi was so tasty that we cannot resist our mouth from having 2 glasses"
4.0,"Delhi Highway, a name true to its royal interiors and architecture. The ambience is truly beautiful and enchanting.   The meal experience was as follows-  Soup:  Badaam Shorba- A plain soup with light peanut flavour  Chaats:  Dahi bhalla papdi chaat- The chaat was nicely made with proper amount of spices and the sweet n tangy flavours Gol gappe- it had4 different paani- pudina, orange, imli, cranberry out of which imli and pudina flavour were nice, rest two didn't go well with the puri  Starters:  Chipotle Paneer Tikka- Paneer marinated and cooked in tandoor, very spicy. Tandoori cheese Aloo- it did not have much cheese as the name suggests  Naram Dil kebab- it had too much of ilaichi and did not have any other taste Dahi Sheekh Kebab- very soft kebabs with not much spices or flavour, deep fried Charcoal mushroom- this was delicious, the mushroom were well marinated Fruit salad tandoor- a different kind of starters for healthy eaters, sweet fruits mixed with spices and cooked in tandoor  Mains:  We had their signature Thali which had- Paneer Lababdar, Veg Kadhai, Pindi Chana, Daal Delhi Highway, Anguri kofta curry Breads- Naan, tandoori roti, tandoori baby kulcha Rice- Dum Biryani  The quantity of the Thali is a lot for one person. The variety of curries were good, the daal makhani could have been better. The bread was soft and fresh. The Biryani was very blunt in flavour.  Dessert:  Jalebi Rabri, Gulab Jamun- both were average  Beverages:  Delhi sweet lassi- the lassi was too sweet and could have been thicker  Overall rating:  Food- 3.8/5 Beverages- 3.8/5 Ambience- 4.5/5 Service- 4/5"
4.5,"This was our second visit to Delhi Highway and we were not disappointed. Like our first trip, this was also a family outing and every dish we ordered was impeccable. We are from north India and every time we have come here the food, its taste and the ambiance has reminded us of home. Guru, went out of his way to serve us well and was constantly checking if we were comfortable. I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to explore and taste food from North India.  Heres what we ordered  Starters - Dahi ke kabab (highly recommended) - Platter of Paneer tikka  - tomato dhaniya shorba  - sweet lassi (highly recommended)  Main (all dishes highly recommended) - Malai kofta - Lahori Paneer - Langar wali dal  - dal Sunehri   Sweets - jalebi"

Royal interior with light golden lighting realy amazing , they have two seating areas , one is on grownd floor and the main seating area is the first floor . we choose to seat on first floor . Nice food and hospitality at a royal place realy enjoyed a lot .... My Rating Food: 4.5/5 Service : 5/5 Ambience : 5/5"
5.0,Excellent food and ambience..! Great taste especially the Panneer..! The tandoori panner was a little bit harder  which was the only blip otherwise keep up the good work guys..
3.5,"we originally planned to visit southindies but it was overcrowded on the weekend at 1pm as there was a year end food festival going on and were fully booked till 2.30pm. so this was our plan B. there was no wait time but tables are fully occupied. serves only veg.  ambience is distinct like a durbar. staff is courteous but service is very slow. price is steep 700+ taxes per person. final bill amounted to almost rs 3000/- for 4 people.  opted for thali. first came the welcome drink followed by shorba/soup, papad.  then came the pani poori and dahi papdi chaat, next came the 6 types of starters with mint chutney- potato, paneer, dahi roll, cutlet, kebab, fritter.  main course with a biryani, raitha, 2 types of roti- naan, whole wheat roti, sweet lassi, paneer curry, peas curry, chana curry, malai kofta, dal makhani, gulab jamun, rava halwa, salad.  guess i covered every item and got the names right.  i liked the shorba, starters, whole wheat roti and the curries the most. biryani qty was very less though they promptly served seconds upon request. raitha accompanying the biryani was very very good.  lassi is excessively sweet. wish we were given a choice of choosing butter milk instead for the price they are charging so kind of disappointed in that aspect.  recommend to try atleast once. a must try for those who love north indian khana. a very family friendly place. service needs to ramp up. doubtful if i will be visiting again as its not vfm for a vegetarian feast.  food: 4/5 service: 3/5 ambience: 4/5 vfm: 3/5 overall rating: 3.5/5"
5.0,Delhi Highway  This restaurant I feel is one of the best north Indian vegetarian restaurant in Bangalore . A must visit place for veg lovers . From starter to dessert you will love them all... Jalebi with rabidi must try  Ambience looks gorgeous like a palace and service is fast and finished....  Must recommend to try.........
1.0,Totally overrated place. No Value for money. Taste is just average. We had Aaloo Tikki as starter. The one that was served as no where near North Indian Alloo Tiiki. I never had Big Channaa in chat. The aalloo patty was also not cooked properly.  It was same case with main course.  Ambiance is good. They dont have HAPPY staff to serve. That it self takes away half of taste. Will never like recommend to anyone for the given price.
3.0,"Good experience, will surely recommend others as well. Please do add a little more spice in the food.........."
2.5,Thali is elaborate but does not sing a song in your palette though the ambience is good! One visit is a must for all the Pure veggies. Very courteous staff!
3.5,Nice good food ! And ambience is something different and innovative I liked it !  Pav bhaji its a unique taste  Panner is so soft and good to taste  Corn Palak soup  its different and yum  Jalebi is one of my favourite ! And I order them Every time I go
4.5,Great food and service. Recommend the place. Starters were great. The place is ambient. Very well located. Clean and bright. We all loved the food.
5.0,"We really enjoyed lunch buffet at Delhi highway. Panipuri, starter, biryani all were simply awesome. Specially we would want to thank Guru and Rafiq for wonderful service!!"
4.0,"I've been here 3 times and I've always gone with the fixed menu Thali. The price on weekend is ~750 per person and I feel its a bit too pricy but they have a lot of variety. It starts with a welcome drink, masala papad and soup, then chat and golgappe, then a great variety of veg starters like kebabs and paneer and then the actual thali with a dal, lots of veg curries, raita, sweetdish, rice and roti/naan and lassi. Its too much food for one person but its awesome. My favourites were the hara bhara kabab, naram dil kabab, palak kofta, pindi chhole and the gol gappe. The service was ok and the food tasted good, not excellent. The quality of rice and a few sabzis could have been better and the quantity is limited, although gou can ask for more. Overall its always a pleasure eating here and I would definitely love to come back."
1.0,Havent had worst food that this. Not sure what Chef was thinking while cooking the food.  Quantity and quality both are not at all satisfactory.
2.0,"Very bad experience, poor management, lack of knowledge of the staff.  When asked for thali on a Sunday afternoon, the response we get is ,Sir, currently we are running out of thali and the best thing he told was Our Chef is busy!! Who expects this when you visit a fine dining restaurant for their speciality.  Very bad experience!  Not up to the mark."
4.0,"Recently I had the chance of visiting a place whose Grand look allured me all the time ...   Among all other eateries on that road .. this place stands out because of the quaint green sign which subtly tells it's a pure veg .   Delhi Highway, specializes in authentic North Indian cuisine . It has come up with an interesting offer for all of us! It is ""Celebrating"" Demonetization; they have come up with their own innovative offer ""FOODIEMONETISATION"".   Their best selling dish, Thali is being served at a Demonetised price! Lunch thali only for Rs. 500 (Inclusive taxes) and dinner Thali at Rs. 500+taxes. This offer is available until 7th December 2017 and is valid only on weekdays(Monday-Thursday).  So if you are looking for that authentic North Indian thali, go for this delicious Thali with your friends and family!  I dare - you cannot eat it all alone !!  Personally I liked the the badam shorba, ,pesto over folded papad. Spoilt for choice paanipuri &, kebabs.                                                                 avrilsfoodjournee.com"
3.0,Okayish.. food is fine .. not so great actually.. Ambience was fine. More of a family dinner place but at times this makes the place a bit noisy and spoils the dinner experience...
4.0,"**Decent dineout place for family**  On my friend's birthday I had been to this place with his family.As they were looking for pure vegetarian resto my friend chose this place.finally we all loved this place. This Resto is beautiful ,the lights are very eye catchy.without thinking too much we ordered buffet for all.  Buffet consist of paneer thikka,Cheesy corn balls, Pani Puri, Dahi Puri. Veg sheek kebab. All the starters were very good.cheesy corn was ultimate. Next they serve roti,Kulcha's with different varieties of curries. Bendi fry was top notch. Biriyani was servred with Raita and it was very good.  In desert they had Gulab jamoon and some Kheer. Gulab jamoon was tasty but it was heavy. Kheer was equally good. Lassi was superb.  I suggest this place if you are looking to dine out with your family.(Only veggies).Service here was little slow.  Service:2.5/5 Ambience:4.5/5 Quality:4.5/5 Value for money:4/5"
3.5,"Ordered Veg seek kebab, Raaj Kachori, Paneer Delhi style, Tandoori roti, Garlic naan  Raaj Kachori was excellent, and the curry was decent though we would have preferred it a bit more spicy. The kebab seemed under cooked.  Food - 3 Service - 4.5 Ambiance - 4.5"
4.5,"When you are tired after the day long work or want to hit some great ambience on weekends, especially when you are from North and missing home... This is the place for you and your mood and yeah your tummy tooo..  Highway within the city..."
3.5,"Taken aback with the ambience, this place was on my wishlist for a long time. Having decided to go veg that day, a thali was recommended to me by the staff. And i must say, it was a good choice. Firstly it was a welcome drink which was a Pomegranate juice. Their extravagant starters which also included varieties of chaats, made us full. Their thaali at the had around nine different varieties of curries along with rotis and veg biryani. Ending it with a matka Lassi was like an icing on the cake. All of it came upto a cost of Rs.500 for the unlimited thali. That's value for money. Really friendly staff and prompt service."

3.5,"******Recommended****** #WholeWheatFulkaTacos #CarcoolMushroom #DahiPapdi  +++Overview Sophisticated it looks as you pass by. Very Indian is the ambiance. The seating needs improvement to get more comfort.  +++Drinks #VirginSangria - A non alcoholic version of the regular sangria. Chopped apple gives the freshness of the drink.  #Lassi - Served in a clay glass, the portion size is small. But was not very thick. Have had at several places in town, so was disappointed with the version at DelhiHighway. +++Food #MoongDalPapad - Version of masala papad. Conical shaped papad served with some fresh salad stuffing with the pesto sauce.  #PaniPuriShots - Cranberry, Orange, Sweet and Khatta are the water flavors. Try Sweet and Khatta. Avoid the others.  #DahiPapdi - Beautiful presentation and lovely taste. The sweetness and the spices were well balanced. Loved it.  #BadamShorba - Personally I hate dry fruit based soup. So wont judge this. Try is you have tasted previously elsewhere. Not for first timers.  #CarcoolMushroom - Tender mushroom, with generous stuffing of paneer, cheese and some other veggies.  #ChipotlePaneerTikka - Slightly on the spicier side, but the paneer cubes were well marinated and very fresh and soft.  #TandooriCheeseAloo - Nothing special, just topped with grated cheese. Avoid until an potato lover.  #NaramDilKebab - Fried, made up of paneer and mozerilla cheese. Always tasty as the cheese gets slightly melted.  #DahiSeekhKebab - Seemed to to a mismatch with the name. Was very dry and the flavor of dahi was lost due to improper stuffing and cooking.  #LahoriKebab - Tikki of variery of Indian veggies with khus khus on it. Decent, a one time try.  #WholeWheatFulkaTacos - That was the hidden gem. Mix fusion of Indian with the western style. Loads of veggies with heavy shredded cheese. Served with sour cream and fresh salsa sauce.  #FruitSaladTandoor - Well marinated fresh fruits cooked in the tandoor. Fresh and very juicy on each bite.  ------------------THALI------------------  Items : Dal Makhani , Malai Kofta, Pindi Chana, Paneer Lababdar, Veg Kadai, Biryani, Raita, Gulab Jamun, Jalebi & Rabdi.  Indian breads : Naan, tandoori roti and cheese kulcha. (cheeseKulcha seemed more like the paneer kulcha)  Average was the taste. Seemed overly flavored to me. You wont feel like eating much due to the essence added. Its a value pick in the menu. Lots of food served at that price is the key benefit for the customer.  POSITIVE------------------------------------------------- 1. Chana was good on taste. 2. Breads were crisp and good. 3. Veg kadhai and the raita was decent.  NEGATIVES------------------------------------------------- 1. Jalebi is served with Rabdi on top but it gets soggy towards the end of meal. Reserve this once the meal is finished. 2. MalaiKofta was spongy and less on the paneer and veggies side. Too sweet. Please lower down the essence.  3. DalMakhani needs to be modified. Needs more slow cooking for the perfect texture and smoothness.  4. Biryani rice was too dry, seemed it went through multiple rounds of cooking.  5. GulabJamun too was not perfect. Felt it lacked the softness. It was not very smooth, this needs a proper preparation in order to get the excellent output.  +++Service Very professional, they make serious efforts to give all the comfort you need. Do call out to them, if any of the dishes disappoint you. Reach me on rahul071190@gmail.com                                             instagram.com"
4.5,"Whenever we have visited DelhiHighway, every time the visit has been delightful. The ambiance is nice, service is prompt and the food is awesome right from starters to dessert. Especially the taste of chats is best among what you can have in BLR. Staff is good and especially Biswajit Das is awesome with helpful suggestions while placing the orders. His hospitality acumen is one of the main reason for the repeatedvisit to this place."

4.0,I visited this place with my family. The quality and quantity of the north indian food was really good. They have given very high importance to the aesthetics as well which is a treat to your eyes. The place can get a bit noisy if a large crowd is left unattended. Overall had a nice experience.
4.5,Good value for money if you take the thalis. Its a pure veg restaurant but still all the items are just totally authentic north indian and tasty as hell.  But don't expect overly spicy food.
3.5,"I have passed by Delhi highway loads of times, the blue & white structure always tempted me as it looked very elegant. My vegetarian friends had loads of praises about the food & ambiance too., so it has always been on my list.   I went over to try out their weekday Thaali which they have on offer till DECEMBER 7th for a great price .  Starters are served at the table before they bring you the main Thaali. My favourites from the meal were - the badam shorba, chipotle paneer tikka, their masala papad with a twist ( the freshly chopped onions n tomatoes are tossed in olive oil & served with some basil pesto ), charcoal mushroom, tandoori fruit salad , Pindi Chana, tandoori baby kulcha , jalebi Rabdi & gulab jamun. I found some of the starters served( Dahi seekh kebab, naram dil kebab etc.) were quite oily for my liking. The food had lots of cardamom flavours in it, which is not something I enjoy. He dal makhni could have been better.   My take is they can improve the quality of the food rather than have loads of dishes being served, because the taste & flavours did slack in the main course. Also there are about 6-7 starters, which filled us up & we couldnt eat much from the Thaali.   They have a good fusion ala carte menu which has interesting options to choose from. Im gong back soon to try out the ala carte options for sure .   Look to indulge in an all vegetarian meal when you are around Indiranagar ?? Then, look no further than Delhi Highway.  The restaurant has stunning interiors & ambiance, it will make your meal a memorable for sure..!!   #delhihighway #vegthaali #thaalifestival #binge #vegetarian"
4.0,"Delhi Highway by the name you must be thinking that it is a dhaba type restaurant. But you got it wrong, it is a fine dine restaurant with moghul style decor. Located in Indiranagar,12th main. The entrance is grand. It has two floor of seating with beautiful decor. I loved the ambience, calm and pleasant with hindi songs playing in the background which isnt too loud. Seating arrangements is comfortable and the tables are well organised.                                                                 ...Read full post on sonaliboliya.wordpress.com"
4.5,"Yesterday (Wednesday) I hosted a party, the ambience gave a feel of royalness. Being pure vegetarian, we tried this vegetarian family restaurant. The cuisine were delicious. The incharge; Mr. Saroj Kumar Pradhan and his staff took good care of all the details."
3.0,"Had heard a lot about this place so decided to visit it over the weekend. We ordered the thalis (which is supposed to be there speciality). Though the starters were nice, everything else was average quality only. There are a lot of other places nearby in Indiranagar where you can eat much better north Indian food for much less!"
3.0,"Visited this authentic restaurant on a Friday evening in Indiranagar. It is a vegetarian non alcoholic restaurant. The best way to reach - it's on the same line as the very famous 12th main of Indiranagar. Easy to locate beacuse of its grand stature.  Ambience and Decor : The place is grand. When you see it, it seems like a little palace constructed in its midst. The lighting I thought is nice. Not too much and not dark at all. It has both ground floor and first floor seating. There are sofas as well as the chairs assigned.  Service : Service is ok. When I entered, there was no one to hold the door. And he came quickly came running for it. While in during the orders, the servers and the staff ask you if you have any concern about the food and patiently listens to the changes. Though some of the servers are clueless if what the dish is.  Drinks :  Virgin Sangria : We started with the virgin mojito. A nice drink to try on. Apple based and Has little apple pieces , which is refreshing and filling. Lassi : The authentic kulhad glass of lassi. It started so good because the kulhad really adds the flavour but to my surprise, it was like runny water. Not at all thick and no malai on top. Just some shavings of pistachios.  Appetizers: *Moong dal papad So it started with a serving of moong dal ka papad with veggies inside with pesto sauce. Very good presentation. Though I found the combination little off. The bitterness of moong dal ka papad cooked on direct fire was too much.  *Badam Shorba A tomato soup with little shavings of almonds. A disappointment.  Chat: *Pani Puri shots* There were 4 types of Pani with it. The basic one, the orange juice, the cranberry and the masala. Don't try the orange and cranberry. It will ruin your taste. *Dahi Papdi* Awesome dish. Beautiful presentation and total appetizing. Loved it.  Starters : *Carcool mushroom ( recommended) This one is a must try. Soft mushrooms stuffed with paneer and then cheese and then marinated and cooked. *Chipotle Paneer Tikka* This one had only one flavour. Only spice. Too much spicy and no taste at all. When complained they changed and bought a less spicy one, but that was also a little bland. *Tandoori Cheese Aloo* So had a lot of expectations with this one. But it is just plain aloo pieces bolied and cooked with shredded cheese. Disappointment. *Naram Dil Kebab( recommended) Crispy on the outside and stuffed inside. A nice try. *Dahi seekh kebab* It had too much of elaichi in it. When they brought the second time, it was too oily. With no color or top and oil just pouring out. *Lahori Kebab* It is just normal kebab with veggies. Nothing new. *Whole wheat fulka Tacos* (recommended) A total fusion dish. Beautiful tacos stuffed with paneer and cheese. A must try. *Fruit salad tandoor* Fruits marinated and tandoored. A basic dish. Could be tried.  Main Course : They serve a thali for each person which includes the basic Delhi dishes like : Dal makhani Malai kofta Pindi Chana Paneer lababdar Veg kadai Dum biryani Along with curd, Rasagulla and jalebi. Indian breads : Naan, tandoori roti and baby kulcha. So being a north indian myself, I am very particular about the dal makhani served. The one served here was a little sour and tingy at end. Not cooked enough and not creamy. Malai kofta is little too sweet. Pindi Chana are basic but lacks the flavour. Paneer is delicious and well cooked. The biryani was ok and could be made better. Baby kulcha was stuffed with paneer and cheese and was a nice try. Jalebi is served with Rabri on top but it dogs away the crispness until you finish your main course. Suggest them to serve it at the end.  Overall the place can do so much better with the food by just cooking basic flavours. Overall - > Ambience - 4/5 Service - 3.5/5 Food - 2.8/5 Value for money - 3.5/5  foodndestinations.com"
4.5,My overall exp was quite good. We ordered thali. I didnt like their welcome drink and sev puri but yes the masala papad and pani puri was good. Starters were quite crispy and tempting. We ordered it once again. Main course was the best I would say. Desserts were quite juicy and yummy. Ambience is quite good. Atleast one should visit this place once!!
4.0,Visited this place a few months ago. It's a pure vegetarian North Indian restaurant and has good food and decent ambience. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity served. Good place for veg food.
1.0,"Seems like the name of delhi it not getting the fame it should. We ordered for malai kofta which was a mere maida ball, tandoori roti burnt on the surface, soggy in the center. For me it was more of a waste of time and efforts. The good isnt that great either... Servicing staff was good, though simple dishes are a task for these fellows. Though disappointed by the food, corner house did help us treat our taste buds with chocolate ice cream...."
4.5,"If you are a vegetarian and dying to have good veg food this is the place u must visit, amazing food. Had been to the restaurant a couple of times and the ambience is great! Overall a great experience"
4.0,"There is a saying  The belly rules the mind  So it did on a Friday night when I visited a pure vegetarian restaurant with aprejudice that a pure vegetarian restaurant may not impress a hardcore non vegetarian as much .  Easy to spot on 12thMain Indiranagar , Quintessentially Moghul style dcor withgrand entrance, beautifully lit with a royal theme to the dcor overall, however doesnt go with the delhi highway name of the restaurant since its not dhaba style its more a reminiscent of moghul darbar I was always drawn to this place as it stands out on that road but never got around to going here because it was all veg. Finally visited here as they have a campaign going on called foodiemonetisation , the deal is that they have cut down the pricing to 500 Rs for their UnlimitedThali . What a thali it was that I barely got around to indulging in the main course as Starters were the star of the evening  A good option specially forPure Vegetarians looking fora fine dining experience Rating : Food : 4 /5 Ambience 4.5 /5 Cost : 4/5 Service : 4 / 5 Misc  Parking , portions , uniqueness  4.5/ 5 Overall  4.3 ~ 4 .0  :Ambience / Dcor : Opulent dcor and the Ambience is very relaxed , almost serene even though most of the tables were occupied as the background music compliments the ambience and cuts the chatter out and the tables are at good distance from each other . :Service : The staff were well trained and knew the dishes & the ingredients well , There was a slight delay in the arrival of the thali after the starters were served , it could be due to the Friday night rush , yes this place was almost full  :Food : Welcome Drink  Virgin Sangria - Mix of apple , oranges and cranberry , well presented , but a tad bit too sweet for my liking  Soup * Badam Shorba  My first time trying this , it was a tomoto based light soup with badam flakes .InThe first few sips raw flavour of badam was obvious but the taste grew on me and was quite comforting Chat * Dahi Bhalla Papdi chat & Gol Gappe shots Gol Gappe was served with 4 types of Pani  sweet & Tangy, Spicy , Cranberry juice & orange juice . Instead of aloo filling chivda / farsan was served . This fusion Pani puri wasnt veryappetising & the combination of fruit juices with puri didnt go well , however dahi bhalla papdi chat was good Starters* Chipotle Panner Tikka Tandoori Cheese Aloo Naram Dil Kabab Lahori Kabab Charcool Mushroom Fruitsalad Tandoor Dahi Seek Kabab  Starters sure was the star of the evening . My personal favourite was Chipotle Panner , well coated and extremely tender Panner tikka and Naram Dil kabad which was creamy & yoghurt based , lightly spicedstarter which was crispy from outside . Charcoal Mushroom , Lahori kebab & Dahi seek kabab were also were very good starters . Tandoori cheese aloo was extremely spicy and the masala was more on the outside rather than being infused into the small potatoes and Fruitsald Tandoor was bit too tangy for my liking  Mains * Paneer Lababdar Veg Kadai Pindi chana Dal Makhani Anguri Kofta curry  Classics of delhi cuisine in a single thali , decent and nothing too extraordinary probably didnt impress me much after a good round of starters . Paneer Lababdar gravy needs to be richer & the gravy thick and elaichi flavour was standing out too much , Veg kadai was tasty but tasted more like bindhi sabzi , Pindi chana was a bit bland , Dal makhani was good but can be better & Anguri Kofta was very sweet and dominant flavour of elaichi which I didnt like  Breads * I opted for Tandoori Baby kulcha with mozerella stuffing and topped with kalongi & till ,it was extremely delish by itself but very filling . Put cheese on / in anything & I love it , if you arent the type choose garlic naan instead Rice * Biryani tasted more like jeera rice , but well-made & very flavourful  Desserts * Jalebi Rabdi Gulab Jamun Delhi Special lassi  Crispy Jalebi with Cold rabdi was my favourite from all the desserts Lassi was not very heavy , it was light and had a hint of vanilla served in a earthen cup  Delhi Highway has fusion dishes on their Ala carte menu & we tried Phulka Tacos . Fusion Dishes are difficult , it can go very wrong or go wow , the latter is rare but delhi highway nailed it right Overflowing with cheese , Presentedbeautifully & tasted so good . Highly recommend theirfusion menu  Overall : Despite it being a pure veg restaurant , there are plenty of options and some very innovative dishes Great option for fine dining for a relaxed dinner with your group Opt for the thaliif you have agood appetite specially now that the prices have been slashed it should give you all the more reasons to head here , Otherwise ala carte has a lot to offer specially if you are a diehard non vegetarian like myself but enjoy veg starters, fusion dishes and a nice ambience , Delhi highway is a great place to consider !"
4.0,"Delhi Highway is located just before Humming Tree. The ambience and decor was very nice, giving a little feel of the North. I ordered the thali, as I was too confused about what to eat. It was the right thing to do. It had everything, and ultimately proved to be cheaper than A-la-carte. It had a shorba, kebabs, chaats, beverage, curries of 4-5 types, biryani, rotis, salad and sweets. A pure vegetarian restaurant, with a family environment. The service was also very good. Would definitely suggest this place for a vegetarian meal!"
5.0,Food is very good and good take care my table mr raj keep it up naram dil kabab and main corse paneer delhi stye misi roti lachha parotha desserts jalebi rabdi
3.5,"A so so experience overall, the Waiters and Steward being uncourteous and careless from the time we arrived. Service needs to be tweaked up.  Food was good and hence uplifted our mood. Some of there specialities like makai pan cake (mini makai roti) with sarson saag, paneer lahori, sizzling matar kulcha etc... Very Good :):)  Ambiance was nice overall, but a tad noisy.  Too much of chaos amongst the Waiters. Certainly does not provide a relaxed feel.  I may give it a second chance only for its food :):)"
5.0,food is awasome and service is also very good  guru and Vishwajeet are very helpful...we have ordered panner sabji and veg seekh kabab with lassi

4.5,Delhi highway Pure vegetarian family restaurant located in indiranagar serving authentic north indian food. Visited the place yesterday with my friends and opted for Maharaja Thali serving  Welcome drink Tomato & basil sorba  ***Chaats*** Pani puri shots - Authentic sooji puri with moong and aloo stuffing and pudina panni Dahi puri - Spicy tangy sweet imli chutney made it the must try dish  ***Starters*** Dahi ke kebab - The melt in mouth kebabs with crispy crust was the best I had in recent time. Panner tikka - Panner was soft and properly marinated. Corn tikki - Deep-fried dish yet less oily was a hit among us.  ***Main course *** Panner makhani Bhindi do pyasa Pindi chole Panner handi Dal makhani Veg pulao with raita  ****Dessert*** Hot gulam jamun Phirni(must try) Kullad lassi  Price - 508 excluding gst @ P.s - I had three kullad lassi and five katoris of phirni
3.0,This place is a great place for vegetarian and does serve great dal makhani and kadhai paneer. Although I must point out that the quantity is really less and the prices are high. I guess they charge you for the good ambience. But yes improvement needed on those. Rest good service.
5.0,"Quintessential Castle with appealing glass exteriors, this place is easy to spot.                                                                                                                              Modern layout spacious and bright, stunning interiors with antique furnishing and vintage cutlery, thats how Delhi Highway is different from the others and gives a feel of Traditional North Indian Dining.                                                                                         The variety available did put me in a dilemma, but like many, I too opted for the Unlimited Thali.                                                                  We were served Fruit Punch with a dominating mango flavour, being a mango lover I enjoyed ever drop of it.                                      Dahi Papdi and PaniPuri platter , 2 types of chat like promised... Dahi Papdi was a treat with flavour explosion of sweet , tangy and chilli. Pani Puri shots were just ordinary.                                                                               Cone shaped Stuffed Masala Papad, Shorba, Paneer-Tikka, Makai-Ke-Kebab, Hara-Bhara-kebab, Naram-Dil-Kebab , Kebabs- well marinated with exemplary filling, starters did excite my palate.                                                                                          Main Course served on a Majestic thali with Dal Makhni, Bhindi, Chana and Paneer subzi with roti and veg biryani, relished every thing served. Gulab Jamoon and kesar phirni, completed the spread.                                                                       Thanks to Rehman and team for taking the initiative and serving with a smile and making my dining experience memorable .                                                                                                                  Ambiance, courteous- prompt service or the Food Delhi Highways magic did work well on me."
4.5,"Delhi Highway lunch with extend family of 17 people was a great experience on Oct 20, 2017. The food was very good. Staff was Courteous . What they can do is reduce quntity t oaviod food wastage. They can come up with 2-3 options such as mini meals / unlimited meas /only starters  etc....."
3.5,"Ambience is good. Food quality is good but can be improved, especially the quality of rice used for making Palav. Staff is highly courteous and friendly. We were served by Mr Rahman, and his attitude was very good. He even helped us with order and was very patient and cheerful. Only thing I would request this restaurant is consider revising the prices which is a bit on higher side."
1.5,"Went there on 15th Oct with the family. Ordered tomato shorba, paneer starters, paneer gravy, black daal and rotis. The food was way worse than we imagined. For a restaurant that serves authentic Delhi food, it was far from good. The daal was the only thing which was decent, although ive had better daal in worse restaurants.  The paneer starters were undercooked and very bland. The Tomato shorba was more water and spices than tomato in it.   The seating in the restaurant is quite bad as well, the tables are lower than normal making it quite uncomfortable. The stewards are also mis-managed with last minute shuffling of chairs around. Half the tables had cloth napkins while others were just given tissues. When you goto a high priced restaurant with a certain ambience one does expect that atleast cloth napkins would be given. Only tissues are ok and understandable for low cost restaurants.  If you are thinking of going there id suggest otherwise, as they still have a lot of things to fix specially the food quality and taste."
3.0,"Visited this place for Diwali dinner. The food taste and quantity was decent but the pricing was a huge let down.   We had ordered  1. Dahi Sekh Kebab: Really good and really heavy  2. Daal Sunheri: Average  3. Triple Orange: Tasted exactly like Real orange juice. Disappointed  4. Rotis: Way over the top expensive  5. Jeera Rice: Good   The first three items were all marked as must try.   Coming to the price, nothing could actually justify it. Neither the decor nor the ambience nor the taste. Considering the taste we can easily get similar type in other Indian restaurant on the same road with a better decor and price less that this one.   Might not visit this place again reason being a completely Veg restaurant and for reasons mentioned above."
2.0,Had been for dinner with family. Ambience is great but dont expect the food to be the same. Food is average. Lassi n vigin mojito was the only good thing.

1.5,"We tried a la carte in delhi highway before which was quite good. So we tried set thali this time, which turned out really bad. In startes only aaloo n paneer. For the price they charge they can give sone mushrooms n babycorns..Also the main course sabjis were below average. I wish they improve on quality..."
4.5,"This is the second time I visited Delhi Highway. In comparison with my initial visit, this time experience was superior. They have seating area on two floors. I prefer the first floor due to the large area and better decor.  We went there on a Tuesday afternoon. We booked the table in advance to avoid any last minute hiccups. Being Diwali season, we noticed many office crowds in large groups for having lunch.   They had unlimited meals option and we opted for the same. The meals were reasonably priced at around INR 550. The spread was elaborate and we were served continuously with Fruit Punch, Veg Starters, Paani Puri, Dahi Chaat, Lassi, Rotis, Multiple Maincourse Dishes, Pulao, Deserts. The waiter was very friendly.   The royal decor of this place is ideal for getting few photos clicked in your traditional attire."
4.5,Pindi chana was very good. Butter Naan has lots of butter and is very tasty. Liked the ambience. The waiters Salman and Dipun were friendly.  Will certainly recommend
5.0,We had the thali here. The food had the authentic flavour of delhi and the quantity too was unlimited. The ambience was nice and cosy and the service was brilliant. A definite restaurant to visit for anyone looking for authentic delhi food. Bishwajeet and Dipun were very helpful and courteous.  27th jan 2018  Visited again and this time had a la carte. Very good food and prompt service. Dahi ke Kebab was really delicious.
4.5,"Feels like walking into a Delhi wedding. Nice decor that stays true to restaurant's name. Delicious food. We like the snacks a lot and recently tried the thali, which was very filling and yummy."

5.0,"Great food and great service! Ordered pesto kebab which was fantastic. Followed this by a portion of matar kulcha, and tandoori baby kulcha. Thanks for the hospitality."
5.0,The best vegetarian North Indian restaurant in Bengaluru. The food never dissapoints and the service is always quick. Been here many times the thalis are value for money. The paneer is the softest and freshest. The stewards Imran and Dipun were attentive and served with a smile always.
2.0,Delhi Highway a pure vegetarian restaurant with beautiful ambience so you got it right I went in only charmed by the ambience for the food was much below average.  Expecting the restaurant only specialising in vegetarian cuisine must excel in it unfortunately most punjabi restaurants serving non veg are equally good with the vegetarian items they are offering  Chole bhature everyones favourite which even the smallest of darshinis in Bangalore do a decent job was a disappointment here.  The roasted masala papad we were offered was perhaps roasted a day before.  The paav baaji had hardly any taste of Aamchur in it. Maybe I could teach the chef to do better.  Paani puri was certainly ready made and not fresh made. Besides the idea of serving it with rose water didnt go great with me although it draws attention with all the colours used for the presentation.  So over all if people who are interested in taking selfies and photographs then yessss this is the place to go but for those who want to eat then there are better ones out there.

3.5,Food is good ... taste n all.. but so richone meal there can spoil ur months of  work out... if u r not that fitness conscious   and wanted a good North Indian meal then its a must try
3.5,"Visited this place on Indiranagar with my team mates for team lunch...   Wanted to try a pure vegetarian place.  Location :   Located on Indiranagar 12th main road... They have wallet parking.  Ambience :   This place has a beautiful interiors & decor. This looks like a palace... The chairs and the sofa have some royal touch to the seating..   and smoothing music in the background.   Food:   1. Welcome drink: It was a mix of banana & guava. It was good but too sweet  2. Masala papad with green chutney  3. Tomato shorba : It was a very thin soup & was horrible.  4. Makai ke kabab: it was really soft & ok  5. Naram dil kabab: made out of hung curd. rally soft and it was the best dish  6. Paneer tikka: soft and juicy  7. Harabhara bhara kabab: was average  8. Dahi puri: was good but too sweet as if they have filled some sweet lassi in it.  9. Pani puri: average  10. Lassi: good but too sweet  11. Gulab Jamun, Kesari Phini: really nice  12. Roti, Kulcha, Naan : Good  13. Dal makhni: nice and creamy  14. Bhindi, Chana masala, paneer masala : Bhini wass the only thing which was eatable.  15. Salad & raitha: salty  Overall the food was good. But being one of the expensive thalis in bangalore it does not stand out.."
4.5,We were there for the dinner. The experience was good. We ordered mix platter for the starter. All were very delicious except the mushroom and tomato Dhaniya shorba was ok ok type. Main course was very yummy. The staff were very courteous and well groomed. The service was prompt.If one is craving for typical North Indian food then this place is the correct choice.
4.0,It's a go to place if my family is around . My mum loves this place . Have tried the Ala Carte as well as the sit done buffet many times and have ordered couple of time home delivery. I find the place decent but it's tad bit expensive. And sultan is a great steward!
5.0,"Was here for lunch with family, the place was occupied but we got our table quick. The complete look of this resultant is simply stunning, the interiors are well done and so is the entrance.   The food here tastes really good, Naram dil kabab , is one of the specials here and the paneer inside is probably the softest I've had anywhere. This restaurant is vegetarian only and the menu is pretty large.  Had their paneer tikka and the paneer tasted fresh and thick. Their malai kofta is something you must have along with the garlic naan.  Their mozerella stuffed kulcha is something new to me and it defiantly worked it's magic.   The staff here is extremely friendly , the food is priced decently for its quantity, the service was fast.  Kudos to the team."
3.0,I'm rating this 3 since the ambience is the ONLY nice thing about this place. It's overpriced. And the only thing that we found nice was the Langoor daal. Punjabi dum aloo was not Soo good but not average either. The aloo wasn't cooked at all and the gravy was sweet which was suppose to be spicy. The starters sucked. Not a great place really. Wouldn't visit again.
3.5,"Got some order delivered, their daal makhni is amzing, the rotis were good to eat even after few hours. The tandoori mushrooms are great. They have a good serving size"
2.5,Good interior and seating arrangement!! But the food served is average!! Although the chef was sweet enough to come to our table to inform about the gluten free option and did have some gluten free Malai koftas after a very long time as they do not use maida to bind the balls to make Malai koftas.

4.0,"This place is a delight to every veggie lover.Not only that even people who can't think food without non veg will definitely fall in love with the food here.The decor is done in a royal mughal style.We had visited for a team lunch and ordered their unlimited thali.The starter was endless with tikki,chaats,panipuris. The accompaniment drink was the jaljeera Lassi,which was a blend of sweet and spicy. In the main course they served kulcha,ghee rice and assorted veggie curries including paneer ,mixed veg and Rajma. The dal was thick and tasted good.The crunchy punjabi masala papad completed the spread.The dessert had gulab jamun and halwa. The spread was good and filling.It had a overall royal mouth feel.The food was served very nicely in large traditional plates and bowls.Overall its a nice experience."

5.0,"Loved it  the ambience, the food , the courteous staff!! Overall very nice experience  even I liked the background songs they are playing"
2.0,What a waste.. We were planning to visit this place for a long time mostly because of it's attractive look. Finally we went here today and were highly disappointed by the food.. Tried one starter and two dishes in main course. Everything was ridiculously bland.. I mean 'delhi highway'.. Really dude..  Moreover it's too pricey for such a below average quality food.  Whatever rating I am giving is because of it's ambiance and decent service. Avoid it.
1.0,"Over all Food was okay, but a waiter there treated us like shit. We asked him to change the a soup  he got because there was extra salt in it. He blatantly refused to take it back and spoke in a very arrogant tone. Will never go back there bcoz of that guy."
3.0,The food is okay
4.5,Loved the ambience here. Food is delicious and my personal favorite is paneer lababdaar. One of the best veg restaurants I have visited.  Only downside is the quantity of curries is bit less.
3.5,"The entrance and the decor is so grand and has the royal touch to the interiors with the yellow lighting adding to it.. Seating is spread across two floors overall quite spacious.  FOOD Started off with the veg kebab platter... kebabs were melt in the mouth, paneer was good.   This the theme is punjabi  I really wanted to try the pindi chhole... but I wasn't very pleased.. they seemed bland and I could not taste the spices that add to its authenticity..... dal makhni was good not wow really. Stuffed kulcha was good and worth trying.  Overall, I missed the play around with different spices in the food that is the forte of punjabi cuisine... Value for money- Cost  wise could be high on your pocket...food didn't really match up to it..."
4.0,"On a lazy Saturday, when we got up late and didn't want to eat at home, we headed to Delhi Highway for their much talked about thali. The starters were delicious, the tomato soup could've been avoided as that quickly filled my stomach. The main course was equally nice - especially the biryani. The staff was also courteous and prompt. I very much liked the place. A must visit for vegetarian North Indian lovers!"
4.0,Good place went there with my family v good ambience food is also Yum had a good time good place for vegetarians they will love it must try place
5.0,"It's one of the best Vegetarian places I've been in Bangalore! The paneer, in all the dishes I have tried, is very soft and melts in the mouth(Naram Dil Kebab is to die for!). The service and ambience is very homely. The staff take good care while ordering and serving making sure you the food like how you want it. Light Bollywood songs in the background, add on to an overall amazing experience!"
4.0,One of the best places to have quality North Indian food in Bangalore. Malai Kofta was amazing. Food is costly but quantity is good. Service was good but a little slow.
5.0,"My search for authentic Mughlai cuisine and north indian food in Bangalore has ended at Delhi Highway. Superb food. Five stars to the Chef.    Ambiance : Good work done around the interiors. Has been designed to make you feel like u are sitting in a royal dining room in some fort.   Service: Very fast and efficient. I was actually wondering if my order was prepared beforehand.   Food : ordered Cream of Tomato soup, Classic Paneer tikka, dahi ke kebab , masala papad , fresh lime soda and Jalebi with Rabdi.   Delicious. The flavors were just right and very well balanced. Melt in mouth kebabs and very refreshing fresh lime soda. And lastly, the showstopper was the Jalebi which reminded me Chandni chowk !    Must Visit !"
4.5,This restaurant I fell is one of the best north indian veg restaurant in this part of the town. It is a must visit for veg lovers. From starters to main course you will love them all. The ambience is just right spacious and bright. I would recommend that you reserve the table since I hope this restaurant is jam packed in the future
4.5,"Great ambience, great service and a delicious food!! Definitely go for the kesar phirni they have. Satisfies the senses like no other. Their service is quick and the staff is quite receltive to your needs. It is a beautiful setup to go eat in!"
4.0,"The place has been consistent on service, quality of food , preparation.All things north ..kababs, chats, chaaz, paranthas, dals rice..,paneer...everything has been good...a safe bet when you want to eat good North Indian veggie food"
4.0,"Delhi highway is a lovely veg restaurant in the bustling indiranagar 12th main... in spite of the competition near by this restaurant manages to attract crowd on Sunday afternoon.. I went there with my family for lunch (6ppl) and we managed to get a table booking an hour before.. we were seated immediately on our arrival..the place has a mughal theme... The cream of tomato soup and 3 starters - corn tikki, aloo chaat, paneer delhi style were all yummy... Our main course was paneer makhani, dal makhani and rajma masala.. Both the paneer and dal were awesome, however i had higher expectations from the rajma  It seemed like it was prepared from the standard vegetable gravy rather than rajma masala.. Still, the good service, yummy food and family fun made my day"
4.0,"Visited this place today and was really impressed by the service provided and the ambience . As my mom doesn't eat onions and garlic they took special care in their service which I would definitely appreciate. The paneer and roti was too soft and tasty . On a whole loved the food and experience , it was worth it   Food & Quality - 4.5/5 Ambience - 5/5  Service - 4.5/5"
2.5,"Had visited this place for lunch with my friends. We had chosen this place since the reviews were decent on Zomato and none of us had tried this place before. The taste of the food was below expectations. The ambience was good. Among the items that we ordered, only 'Charcoal Mushroom' is worth mentioning. The menu also doesn't have varieties. Since its a purely veg restaurant, the price is quite high. Overall a disappointing experience."
4.5,Yesterday we had lunch at Delhi Highway. It's a spacious place with a good ambience. The thali was a good choice as it has almost all the Punjabi staple dishes.The starters were excellent .Every item was delicious.Sweet items could have been better . We also tried their ragda pattice and Dum Aloo n Missi roti.All were very tasty. Service was excellent too. Would have given it 5/5 if the  cost was more pocket friendly !
4.5,"We visited for dinner on the eve of my husband's birthday. We contemplated on the menu and decided to go with the thali just so we could try numerous options. The thali was just perfect and one of the best meals we have had in a North Indian restaurant in Bangalore. We started off with tomato shorba, followed by chats, paneer Tikka, veg kebabs as starters. Main course was paneer gravy, mixed vegetable and aloo Gobi, Dal makhni and kadhi with Naan followed by a lovely pulav. All the items served were perfect mix of spice and not oily. The desserts were doodh jalebi, moong dal halwa, both were the best we have ever tried in Bangalore, followed by a thick and lovely Lassi served in a kulhad. All in all the visit was worth the occasion and the price we paid. The service was a tad slow although,however one of the best meals we have had in the recent times."
2.5,less because the info you had provided over phone regarding reservation over weekend was completely misleading. I had visited with my parents who are Sr. Citizens. Though seating was provided had sofa but it was near to billing counter and wash room. Top floor was vacant but you refused. Front desk response was very bad.  However food was really nice. Lassi and mozzarella kulcha is a must try. Very happy with food quality. But GST KILLS. :) - 18% hurts a lot.  Cons :  Behaviour of front staff.  A bit costly affair.
5.0,One of my personal favourite place! You need to try the thali. The best veg biryani I ever had ! And kick ass starters.  The most lovely thing are it's dessert. Phirni Nd lassi :) Try it out.  The attendants are very courteous.  I love the ambience and it's kinda peaceful..
5.0,"A Very Wide Beautiful Place For Family Dinner Or Just For Casual Father ups. Delhi Highway In Indiranagar 12th Main is Definitely A Heaven For Vegans. It Has An Enticing Collection In Welcome Drinks, And Has Well Maintained Sections For Chaats, Startesr, Main Course And Desserts. The Dishes Welcome Drinks we tried Were The Aam Panna, Watermelon Mojito, Gol Gappa Shots, Mix Chaat, Classic Paneer Tikka, Dahi Seekh Kebab, Tandoori Aloo, Naram Dil Kebab, Fresh Pesto Kebab, And Makai Kebab. Out Of All Dishes Served One Can Barely Find Any Flaw in Them Also The Dishes Were Served Very Beautifully And Were Loking very Mouth Watering. This Place Is Surely A Must Visit Not Only Because of It's Beautiful Ambiance And Good Food But Also Because Of It's Ridiculously Amazing Service.............. All The Best Overall Experience.."
1.5,"The good part: Great ambience and service. The bad part: The food. Absolutely below average. Every single thing we ordered: Soup, Kabuli Kebabs, Paneer Delhi Style, Jeera Rice, Rajma Chawal, Dal Sunehri. All average. The butter naan was really bad. Improve the quality of food for the kind of ambience and service!"
4.5,Delhi highway has been on my must visit since  long time. Finally got the chance to visit them last week. This place lives up to the hype around it. The Pudina Paratha that we ordered was wonderful. I wish I had ordered the paneer Tikka masala. Need to go here again. Will update the review with better pictures and content soon.
5.0,"One of those days when you're craving some great quality north Indian vegetarian food in a pampered fashion, that's when you go to Delhi highway. Thank God for this restaurant, everything we ordered was spot on, the Dal was especially divine."
5.0,"Delhi Highway!   Ambience : 4.5/5 Great service.  Food quality is good. Food quantity also good. Great place for having a lunch/dinner with family.  Surely, Will be back! :)"
5.0,Awesome food and great service. Starters and the main course had lot options and more importantly tasty. Highly recommend this place for vegetarian folks.
4.5,"It is the quintessential Delhi restaurant! Has that ambience of a posh restaurant in Purani Dilli! The meal amplifiesbyour experience, the Thali is unlike any other Thali I have had in Bangalore, there's thought in every dish even in a Thali, there is effort! Please do try the Naram Dil Kebab!   The variety will kill you! :)  Enjoy"
4.5,"Great interiors!  Visited this place twice.  The first time,  I ordered the thaali.  The choice of menu is great for the thaali.  But somehow the unlimited food is always incomplete without an ice-cream. So I give the score 4.5 !  The second time I ordered mushroom for the starters.  It was excellent! But the lasuni palak paneer was very disappointing.  Had extremely strong garlic taste combined with bitter spinach taste.  Havnt had such a pathetic palak paneer sabji before! Roti/Kulchas were soft!   And from both my visit experiences,  the AC temperature was too low.  Cannot withstand the chill for a very long time allowing u to sit more and gorge on the food!   Overall a fine place!"
3.5,"Suddenly landed in this place for a quick lunch .. place was crowded though .. took stuffed mushrooms , butter naan and paneer tikka ... food was v delicious.. naan was soft and tasty .. good place for a north Indian meal"
4.0,Beautiful heritage ambience! Service is very good. Food quantity is also very good. Dal makhani was delicious. Fruit punch was not that good. Overall a beautiful place for having lunch/dinner with family!
5.0,"I visited Deli Highway with my family yesterday and I thought Monday May be place was available but really it's out of imagination after wait  an hour I got a table really for North indians it's a amazing place for  tasty food, good ambiance and music was superb. I had ordered tamatar dhaniya shorba it's really good also naram Dil kebab & Fresh pesto kebab we had it was delicious, Main course I tried paneer Tikka masala, veg kadhai lacha paratha it was delicious,  dessert we had gulab jamun & jalebi rabdi  it was mouth watery..thanks Delhi Highway for a great dinner will visit once again...."
5.0,"I am from New Delhi so when I reached at Bangalore I thought about Delhi Highway may be not proper but I went Sunday night that place it's oh my God...... unexpected crowd was there so after while a minute they gave us a table after I started the dinner I realized why this place was so much famous I visited their two brunches also one in Chennai one in Mumbai sakinaka. So now food was awesome mostly jalebi rabdi, sizzler matar kulcha.  Staffs also very attentive. Really good experience"
1.5,"As I rate it 1.5, I still secretly wish I could have rated it better but to utter disappointment , 1.5 is more than enough for ambience, because food served here is a big No No. Well, did I mention the staff? The least courteous you will find ever. So, we ordered a tamatar shorba , mushroom cream soup and lahori kabab for starters. The shorba was so tasteless, we had to add enough salt to it.The mushroom soup was so pathetic to look at , i stared at it in disbelief.Is this what a zomato rating 4 is like? I will definitely upload pictures for you to see.Later the staff started explaining that it was prepared the right way and we had no idea of food...Like, seriously?Yes,the main course was still bearable but starters are enough to depress you... The experience was worse than just few words written but I think this would do."
2.5,"Employees are more in numbers than customers, yet the service is super delayed. Utter chaos, if thali contents cannot be served or refilled what good is the service. Taste of the food is below average. This is our first visit, leaves a sad taste."
1.5,"This rating is solely for the taste of food!! Ordered naram Dil kebab, Indo Mexican Quesadilla, aloo tikki chat.... all three were lacking in flavour.... Quesadilla was chapati wrapped in flavour less kidney beans and few drops of cheese...No seasoning and I have been asked that this will be the flavour if you eat Quesadilla here....Naram Dil kebab was cold and when asked why it is cold they refried it in oil and served again even after that it was cold from inside... main course  served and nothing great...Not sure of rating 4 or might be one bad day for the chef or me!!!"
2.5,You easily get wooed with the grand and royal entrance to the place. As you enter you feel like you have come to a banquet hall which is not managed properly. The first floor which is slightly better in terms of seating and ambience and where most of the people like to sit and dine. I visited this place on a Thursday night for dinner.  On high recommendations I opted to have Thali. Elaborated Thali menu which covers right from Welcome drink to dessert is an obvious choice for most of the people who come to dine here. Welcome drink is aweful. Starters are fine especially chaat but main course is just about ok and nothing special. Dessert too doesn't really stands any good. Sweet lassi is fine but overall a pretty average place. Service too is too slow considering I visited on a weekday instead of weekend.
4.5,Full marks to this place for providing authentic North Indian food down here in Bengaluru.Had a chance of visiting this place with one of my friends.Guess what...This place really stands out.The interiors is just a wow.The attire of the people serving you gives you a classic Indian feel. Due to heavy priced menu I decided to go for a thali.The thali also did not disappoint me at all.Its priced at 500 odd plus tax.The best part about the thali is it's unlimited.Eat as much as you can.No restrictions.Full value for money is what you get.Starting from masala papad to chat to golgappa you have everything.They also have biriyani in their thali. Indeed a good place with full value for money.Visited this place with Snigdha Behera
3.0,"Third time to this place but service levels have dropped. Delayed service of unlimited thali is cheap tactic to control the appetite!  Friendly staff, simple ambience, great food, lovely music, superb food, wonderful menu items, complementary drinks :)Dimple Kalra   Great place to try north India cuisine....yummy"
4.0,"Ordered in . Their veg fair is really good , a tad bit oily was the only problem I saw . The Indian breads need improvement . Overall a decent place to order in from"
5.0,"I went with my family last two days but I was fill  we are inside as the best place  in Bangalore, we found Best food and excellent service from all staffs .mostly I appreciate from that Manager ..."
2.0,"Great Ambience.  Friendly Staff. Booking table in advance is a good option as it's always high in Demand.  Now coming in to Food its Delicious , you can try anything it's mouth watering. Totally amazing. But But Wait wait wait...  I got an insect in Rajma n That's where the things went far far beyond the reputation of the So cool and highly demanded restaurant. I have always heard about it like people get cockroaches or insects in food, but observed live for the first time. Hope they can manage HYGIENE."
4.5,Quality of food is great. One of the very few places in Bangalore serving amazing dal makhani. Starters are okayish and rates are quite high priced but i suppose thats the price one needs to maintain that ambience.
5.0,"Absolutely delicious food! That apart, the quantity, variety, authenticity, service, ambience - everything else you may look for in a restaurant - top notch!"
2.0,We went to this restaurant with lot of expectations after reading all the reviews. Ambience of this restaurant is really amazing. It looks like a 5-star dining. There isn't much variety in soup and we ordered cream of mushroom and cream of tomato which was quite normal. Ordered couple of starters Dehi Ka Kabab and Narem Dil Kabab. Both the starters tasted the same and it was average taste I would say. Then went to main course and ordered Sizzling Mutter Kulche which was very bad. There was no taste at all and it was like some preservative was added to the dish. It was not even like a kulcha .. It was like a bread and had some peculiar flavour.. The other side dishes had more garam masala and the taste of elaichi and clove were so predominant in each of it.. Taste of food is very average but it's too expensive..     If you don't like more garam masala and elaichi flavor pl don't visit this restaurant.(even soup had elaichi )  This could definitely not be called the authentic taste of Delhi as the  Aloo tikki was very hard like the edges of samosa.. Overall it's not worth the money.    Service and ambience was the real plus point for this restaurant.
4.5,"I had visited this restaurant on a weekday afternoon for lunch. The first thing that draws your attention is the majestic and royal ambience. The interior is sure to stun you with the glory they have. We opted to have their special thali in order to try as many items as possible. It all started with a glass of spicy guava juice, which was quite a different thing in comparison to other similar restaurants. It was followed by tomatosoup which was pretty good. They had some chaat items, pani puri etc. Puri was served on top of a small flask/glass. Followed by this, they had paneer tikka, malai kebab and 2-3 more starters. Paneer Tikka and Malai kabab were really good. The main course had 3-4 kind of gravies, kulchas, butter roti. In desserts, there wereMoong Dal Halwa, Phirni. Moong Dal halwa was delicious. To end the feast, there was lassi served in the clay glasses. The presentation of the food was good. I would say that starters and desserts were extra ordinary and the main course was good. Coming to the service, it was pretty friendly like other similar restaurants. Pricing is a bit tad expensive but worth it. Would be surely visiting it again."
4.5,"This restaurant is on the 12th Main Road in Indiranagar and from outside it looks grand because of its palace style interiors with glass in front. One of the finest vegetarian restaurant which serves authentic North Indian food. The place is quite big , spacious with royal interiors. We ordered special thali and each items in the menu was well prepared and delicious.  Starters : Frozen Mint Mojito Tomato Dhania Shorba Cone Masala Papad  They also have some special starters like: Pani Poori Bhala Papdi Chat Naram Dil Kabab Charcoal Mushroom Broccoli& pesto tikki Achari Paneer Tikka  In Thali they serves:  Pindi Chana a typically punjabi way. Dal Makhni Salad Raita Veg Malai Kofta Kadai Paneer Paneer Lababdar Dum Veg Biryani Ghee Rice Kulchas  Must Try : Mini Kulcha which was like superrbbb. I think the best dish is there.  Desserts: Delhi Special Lassi : which was like Punjabi Style. Jalebi with Rabdi : very delicious. Anjeer ka Halwa : Amazing  They also have some good Fusion Stuff which was like mouth watering.  A good place for family and gruop of friends. Service is very fast.Staff guys is very well mannered and well trained. Manager is very courteous and the staff is very decent. Well on the pricing it is on the little higher side. I love to Visit again. Recommended place for Pure Vegeterain"
3.0,"Went for a lunch with friends last weekend after being intrigued by the exteriors. Cozy place, the seating is a lil hap hazard. Had to wait for 40 mins before the four of us could get a table.  We opted for the thali option instead of a la carte. They didn't have enough 'towel napkins' so upon asking gave us paper napkins. No table mats, which makes it easier for them to clean/ clear tables maybe.  So the thali starts with a welcome drink, shorba, papad cones. The welcome drink was just average had too much ginger not crushed properly. Tomato basil shorba was good. Starters included tandoori paneer, alu, chaat (gol gappe & dahi wada). The tandoori paneer was Good, rest everything not great. They missed serving us the gol gappe, which they served with desserts upon asking!! Gol gappe were a total let down.  Kababs included dahi tikki, shami kebab, hara bhara and one with dal/lentils. Dahi kebab were good, rest just average.  Next the thali/ main course was served. It had dal, paneer, palak corn, mix veg, chole raita, veg biryani, roti/naan  (No kulcha in thali), rabdi jalebi, gulab jamun, lassi. The taste of everything was okay. Rabdi jalebi was a total let down. Wish they replace it with something else! It's totally not as it should be!! The thali is priced at 677 + taxes. The food is okay, service slow and lil hassled! Over all, an average place."
4.5,"Delhi Highway is one such place that is an amalgamation of Glorious Fine Dine - Vegetarian space - that serves some mouth-watering veg delicacies!!  Its located on the busy street of Indiranagar 12th main  near sony signal! Parking isnt a problem as they have loads of space for two wheelers and valet parking for four wheelers  this is a big boon in indiranagar!  This place is on my wish list since long time. Finally I along with my friends decided to pay a visit.  Ambiance  Boy  I was quiet impressed with the plush dcor  The sofas  wooden chair and tables  beige and blue background artistic wallpapers neatly done  paired with pillars as partition - gives one a feel of royal castle!  Ambiance  4.5/5  one would for sure fall in love   Tip -choose the first floor seating space rather than the ground floor.  Food  we choose to try loads of kababs as they mentioned they have few signature ones and also few street food savories! and thali too.   There is a famous song that says Main toh raste se ja raha tha, main toh bhel puri kha raha tha, you know what is the best thing about this 90s track, it depicts the typical Indian street food and their charisma !  We do not need a reason to hang out at the roadside bhel puri-waala or galgappe-waala .   We just cant resist the urge of digging into these scrumptious roadside delights!  Masala papad with a twist - Fabulous presentation!  Dahi Bhalla - in terms of taste it was simply sublime! - After days of relishing them - still im craving for it! Panipuri - presented as shots!  with khatta pani - meetha pani - cranberry flavor pani and mango flavored one -paired with boondi and moongdal stuffing ! Yet another classic way to present our favorite street food!  Team Delhi Highway you guys deserve a big round of applause!!  Drinks  we choose to have Virgin mojito and Triple Orange I loved the virgin mojito  crushed ice and loads of mint leaves made it a deal.  Coming to Starters:- Few assorted kebabs  that I had tasted recently left me craving for more!  Dahi ke kabab  Kebabs made with hung yoghurt mixed with spices  yummy n soft one. (Perfecto)  Fresh pesto kebab - kebab made with fresh pesto green vegetables and batter. (Could be better)  Naram Dil kabab  soft succulent kababs  loved them.  Kabuli kabab  These are the kababs made with kabuli channa and dry fruits like anjeer dates and badam. (Perfecto)  Charcoal mushrooms  sheer bliss Button mushrooms cooked over tandoor  they were stuffed with cheese and cooked with basic spices.  Mini Mozzarela kulchas  One of the best and innovative fusion dishes I had off late! These are the mini kulchas that stuffed with mozzarella cheese and then topped with sesame seeds (both black n white ones) It is served with garlic butter n chilli flakes dip which makes it a lovely sinful combination! A must try dish in here! Sure shot recco ! After all this we tried their Thali IT was simple yet blissful The thali compromises of Veg pulao  daal makhani ; paneer makhani ; paneer labardaar; pindi chanaa ; rotis ; malai kofta and jeera rice It is unparalleled in terms of taste and variety Loved the daal makhani n pindi chanaa The malai kofta stood apart !  We got to know from the staff that they serve a special thali on weekends  so do try it folks ! Then we tried their fusion dish  makhani pasta  It was served with kulchas and served on a plate  with loads of cheese and cooked with tomato sauce It was good! Desserts:- We all ended our meal with two fabulous and toothsome desserts Anjeer ka halwa  Figs crushed and then roasted in ghee topped with finely chopped almonds  It is a rich dessert  but not all would love it!    Rabdi Jalebi was one such dessert that infact left an ever lasting impression - which left me craving for more ! Jalebi, also known as zulbia, is a sweet popular INDIA It is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. They are particularly popular in Persia and Indian subcontinent. Jalebi is eaten with rabri in (North India)  After a long time tasted some toothsome hot crispy jalebis with cold rabri and it was out of the world <3 <3  Food  Food  5/5 The flavors were bang on! Its indeed a heaven for vegetarians! Exquisite place to be when you are in mood for vegetarian fare! You would not be disappointed for sure!  Service: -4/5 - The staff are polite and humble They make sure  they are always on their toes and at your service  Kudos to Mr. Dipun and Mr. Pradeep who took care of things for us and made our day memorable. They do deserve a pat on their back.  VFM  4.5/5  Their prices are a bit expensive when it comes to alacarte Im sure they would patch up if one choses to have thali  It is an assortment of all the kababs along with regular dishes like pulav .  We all had loads of conversations and it was yet another memorable day!  Thank you team Delhi highway for that memorable one!                                             krantiawelltravelledgourmand.wordpress.com"
4.0,"Nothing is more apt for this than the tagline of my page which says The joy of seeing culinary masterpieces is heavenly bliss. Despite Being a hardcore meat Lover, Delhi Highway is a Vegetarian Restaurant that I really loved.  Located in Indiranagar, the hotel hub or food Paradise of Bangalore, Delhi highway has established itself in par with the competition . For few bloggers even little things matter to make a significant impact on the review while others ignore minute details and yet all of us who have been here, the delights crafted by the chef have harmonised all our opinions into praise with no regrets whatsoever. The excellent variety puts you in a dilemma for choice. Dedicated to all my followers who who had asked me what my favourite veg restaurant was and requested me to publish more articles more about the ones with only a green dot symbol. This Place has more sophisticated and elevated versions of the popular local food found in numerous eateries on the highways of Delhi. .....  Food- Lets begin with the splendid starters. Stuffed cone shape Masala Papad  is served to munch on while we wait. Tomato and fresh basil Shorba follows to build up appetite. The Bhalla Papdi chaat was superb as it was an explosion of sweet, sour, tangy and chilly taste. The fired Naram Dil Kebab and Dahi ke kebab were fantastic. Both marination and filling was exemplary.  Cheese Aloo Tandoori was outstanding. The generous covering of cheese made the grilled potato better. Nice Plating.  Tandoori Baby Kulchas is incredible. Stuffed with mozzarella, it is soft and delicious that melts in your mouth. The garlic and herb butter accompanying also take credit in making it brilliant. Easily one of the best Mini Breads Ive ever had.  Highly Recommended. Main Course was served on an amazing Thali which has different flavours to excite any palate. Pindi chana was splendid. The first bite immersed me into imagining that I was actually eating in the capital City or somewhere in North India.  Thoroughly Relished the extraordinary Dal Makhani. Paneer Lababdar was exceptionally good. Ghee Rice was remarkable. A  special mention of Sizzling Matar Kulche for the uniqueness and audacity due to the boldness of spice. Kadai Pasta was phenomenal. A Perfect fusion dish having the Indian Tadka.  For dessert, Hot and crispy Jebali with  Thick and creamy Rabri topped with almonds was exquisite. However some items such as Broccoli & Pesto Tikki and Kabuli Kebab were more like a spoiler and I didn't care for it much. Achari Paneer Tikka can be improved.  The mocktail beverages can also be ......... (7/10)  Ambience- Appealing glass exteriors for those who judge a book by its cover. The name is quite prominent making it easy to spot. Grand Entrance.

4.5,U cannot miss this majestic look of the restaurant from outside and surely gives u the royalty feels once inside !  Ambience is soothing. Really works for a family dinner . We ordered a triple orange to drink- 3/5 nothing special about it.. for starters we got tandoori rolls. Presentation was superb. This fusion dish was spot on. It had a mozzarella stuffing. Cant say no to that! For mains we ordered a standard paneer tikka masala and dal makhani with kulcha. The curry ws exceptionally good. Sweet and spicy with soft panner chunks flavored to perfection! And the dal makhani got no words to describe it ! The smooth consistency and that buttery taste was too good ! The fusion menu is a must try here! They have quite a few interesting dishes! A shout out to the friendly staff too !
4.0,"Located on 12th main, I near popular joints like Mamagoto and Keventers,  this is a great option for those who are looking for a vegetarian restaurant with great ambience.  We had masala papad, golgappe and spinach soup to get started. The soup was great. The golgappe were served in a fun way, with the pani in shot glasses. The filling had sprouts and not potatoes. It was good.  We also tried their sizzling matar kulche, chole bhature (they don't warn you that this is enough for 2 people;) ), kadhai vegetable, ragada pattice, rotis and kaali dal.  The food is good, service is prompt and the items arrive at the right pace. We were too full for desserts but we'll probably visit again for that.  It was packed on a Wednesday evening and I can see why. Give it a shot"
4.5,"In the heart of Indiranagar -12th Main, amidst of restaurants and pubs serving cuisine right from Italian, African, Vietnamese, Japanese and European lies Delhi Highway who welcomes you with it with its royal darbar ambience. The double high ceiling with beautiful artistic designs on both sides of the wall will instantly make you in love with this place. The place is brightly lit with comfortable sofas and chairs spread across space.  We started our royal journey with the following dishes   Virjin Mojito  Little sweet to my taste, it was nothing extraordinary but was liked by all.  Triple Orange  A mixture of orange and cranberry juice. Can be avoided.  Tamatar Dhaniya Shorbha  Mildly spiced soup with good thickness and consistency.  Masala Papad  Beautifully presented, they were served in shot glasses. A small twist made of topping papad with mint and garlic chutney made it quite interesting to eat  Pani Puri Shots: Not exciting at all. Fusion of panis was served which included Cranberry and Mango. Couldnt have more than one shot.  Naram Dil Kebab  Crisp from outside and finely diced tender paneer inside having a coating of cornflakes from outside, the kebabs were just amazing.  Dahi Seekh kebab  The kebabs were not eaten by me but everyone seems to have enjoyed the dish.  Mozzarella Kulchas  All I can say is WOW about this dish. What an extraordinary preparation this was. Italian style kulchas stuffed with mozzarella and served with herb and garlic butter. I could see most repeat orders of this preparation. Must have dish at Delhi Highway  Cheese Aloo Tandoori  Baby potatoes marinated in curd and grilled in tandoor garnished with grated cheese.  Achari Paneer Tikka  The most loved variation of the popular tikka flavoured with pickling spices. Paneer was again soft and juicy.  Charcoal Mushroom - One more outstanding dish. Mushrooms were prepared in tandoori style with a stuffing of grated paneer and spices making it the most delectable item of the menu.  Broccoli Pesto Tikki  They were very similar to hara bhara kebabs in looks except it had a stuffing of chopped broccoli topped with pesto chutney.  Kadai Pasta: Penne Pasta tossed in a special desi gravy topped with a good number of exotic veggies and olive oil. It was served with garlic naan. The combination was unique and was executed very well  Sizzling Mattar Kulcha  Mildy spiced mutter chole served with fluffy and soft kulches on a bed of cabbage leaves.  The main course served in a heavy copper plate with heavy bowls filled with dry and gravy sabji, dal and salad. The thali had Pindi Chana(Rawalpindi style cooked chickpeas), Paneer Lababdar (Cottage cheese cubes cooked in red tomato gravy), Daal Delhi Highway(black daal cooked overnight on tandoor), Kadai Paneer, Dum Biryani and Jeera rice. Daal Delhi and Pindi Chana were simply outstanding. Daal was perfect in every sense and Chana will surely remind you of your grandmothers secret recipe. Again to our surprise, everyday rice in North India simply blew our mind.The aroma of cumin seeds was fresh and went very well with Dal Makhni. Rich and creamy Punjabi lassi wasserved in kulhad with pista coating on it.  For desserts, we were served Jalebi with rabdi and apricot halwa. The jalebis were simply outstanding. The golden coloured jalebis were made to perfection. Right from the colour, texture, sweetness and shape, everything was bang on. On the other hand, the flavour of apricot was quite strong which was not liked very much by everyone.  The Thali at Delhi Highway is priced at Rs.650 + taxes but trust me its worth the money you spend. The thali Menu is huge and offers you variety of traditional starters to fusion dishes to simply mind boggling main course and desserts. Also, the portions are good enough for you to skip next days breakfast :D  Craving for North Indian Food? Without thinking even for once visit Delhi Highway.  Also, dont forget to order Mozzarella Kulcha, Jalebi and Charcoal Mushrooms  Final Verdict:  Food: 8/10  Ambience: 7/10  Service: 9/10  Value for Money: 8/10  Read More Here - eatreviewrepeat.wordpress.com"
4.0,""" Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident "" - Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam   When i, ascended the stairs only one thought kept playing whispers with me. ""Will this restaurant be any good?"". After having read a mixed bag of reviews, you tend to vacillate between a yes and a no. I, need to give myself a good pat on the back for dismissing those thoughts and deciding to pay a visit,  after all. And Holy Guacamole!! I, just realised what I had been missing all these days.   About Delhi Highway :   Delhi Highway, is a restaurant that focuses on North Indian cuisine and is a pioneer in serving vegetarian dishes only. Nope! You really don't need to taint yourself with prejudice about how, this restaurant isn't for you, if you are a non vegetarian. They serve their dishes with that extra zing. They have fusion dishes as well. Fusion is one territory that either makes it or breaks it. These guys, well.. they nailed it.  Decor : A beautiful splurge of opulence is seen without it being the only thing to keep you entertained. The theme, feels more of a Mughal Durbar, rather than a Delhi Highway restaurant or a dhaba. But hey! I'm loving it.   The turquoise & gold, play up with your senses and instantly prep you up for something good. The ambiance is very relaxed and almost serene, even though the ebb and flow of customers keeps on happening.   Hospitality : Well, when you dine amidst a set up that makes you feel like royalty, why wouldn't the service be anything but sterling? The staff members were just what every hotel or a restaurant needs. They have been manicured to just being shy of perfection. 2 chaps come to my mind, Mr. Dipun and Mr. Pradeep, who were just the best. Loved the way, they took care of every little thing and they way they knew the ingredients in a dish right off the bat   The Grub Story : After all that goodness and beaming with joy, here comes my favourite part. La norriture aka Food   Drinks :   Virgin Mojito (Rs.125/-) : As boring as I am, I love staying close to things I don't need to experiment with. My virgin Mojito was quite a pleasant one, nothing extraordinary but good.   Triple Orange (Rs.120/-) : A medley of flavours, which had a good harmony of orange.   Starters :  Tomato Dhaniya Shorba (Rs.99/-) : Again, it was a fair enough soup. More acidity would've made me enjoy this more.   Charcoal Mushroom (Rs.295/-) : Yep! Now we are talking. Such a great twist. The humble Mushroom was stuffed with grated paneer and allowed to blush in the charcoal tandoor, what happened was love on plate for me. The flavours were so subtle and the juiciness of the mushroom was retained as well. Must have   Dahi ke Kebab (Rs.275/-) : I'm a dahi Kabab fan and Delhi Highway just gave me one of the best I've tried in the city. The subtle nuance of spices and letting the hung curd to hero was a great thing. Loved it. Must have   Naram Dil Kebab (Rs.325/-) : Another Kebab, that I couldn't get enough of. Crunchy from out and soft from within.   Mozzarella Kulchas (Rs. 275/-) : I, just can't. I mean it. There isn't anything like it. Period. Nothing. Nada. Nil. Zilch. What an ingenious plan to make me frequent this place. These Kulchas were out of the world. Nothing could beat it. Small and petite with oozing mozzarella and served with herb & garlic butter, which you were supposed to slather on the kulcha. Result? I'm having dreams of eating it everyday. This is their specialty. Please don't miss it!   Main Course :    Thali : We opted for the Thali and yes, it was delicious mess of love and excellence. It had, daal makhani, Paneer lababdar, Pindi chana, Kadai Paneer, Dum Biryani, jeera rice, Malai Kofta and mini Kulchas. The Thali was superb and was worth every penny.   Makhani Pasta (Rs.375/-) : This too was done beautifully with delightful Makhani sauce and served with Kulchas.   Desserts :   Jalebi Rabdi (Rs. 175/-) : Oh! Tears of joy! Tears of utter joy. The jalebi was done to a nice crisp and served on a bed of thick and rich Rabdi. What more could I want. Worth my love   ______________________________________  Verdict : Despite this being a vegetarian restaurant, I did not find any run of the mill flavours. Yes, the whole Makhani, Kabab- shabab thing was there, but the flavours were exceptional and were well curated. Nothing was overpowering or underwhelming, every dish had a certain goodness to it. Ranks a little low on the VFM meter in the "" a la carte"" section, but it's an absolutely marvellous affair, if you are going for the buffet.   Recommends : Mozzarella Kulcha, Dahi Kabab, Charcoal Mushroom, Pindi Channa, Jeera Rice & Jalebi Rabdi!!  Well deserved 4 stars to this amazing restaurant.   /5                                             theplatememoirs.wordpress.com"
4.5,"Decided to visit this place on Indiranagar with a couple of friends...  Wanted to try a pure vegetarian place and the first thing that came in my mind was this place.. As it's not my first visit to this place I have been here couple of times before  Location : Located on one of the busiest road on Indiranagar 12th main road... Parking is not a issue they do have parking for two wheelers  and four wheelers there valet parking too...  Ambience : This place has a  beautiful ambience. For some reason I feel that this looks like a smaller version of a beautiful palace...  The chairs and the sofa have some royal touch to the seating.. There is dim lighting at the night. Very smooth music  Dishes I tried  Frozen mint mojito : a very regular mojito ...  Triple orange : amazing mocktail with flavours of orange and well presented. And also tried one more mocktail which was amazing..  Tomato dhaniya shorba : super excellent flavour.I love that is totally.. it's was different yet perfect  Cone masala papad : the presentation was cute.. The roasted Papad was kept in a small short class and the pauper does well done with some mint and coriander chutney along with some fresh onions and some hint of lemon..  Pani puri: well presented dish and 6 shot glass with 6 flavours came along with Puris and extra stuffing in a separate bowl...  Bhala papadi chai Everyone who had this just loved it. I had to skip this one.  Naram dil kebab : Well done amzing kebas ... It's crispy from outside and soft from inside..M  Dahi kabab This is one thing I make sure I ordered this on my every visit there will be my favourite I was written about this previously... Very soft and tasty Kabab that's all I can say.. .  Fresh pesto kebab : Never heard a tried this before these compounds were amazing very soft and hard Broccoli and pesto leaf.. was served along with mint chutney  Charcoal mushroom : I love mushrooms I think that's one thing I will never say no to.. these mushrooms were really good. the spice level of the mushroom was amazing well cooked just perfect..  Achari panner tikka : The name says it all.. Pickled flavoured paneer roasted well on Tandoori and served with some fresh veggies and Mint sauce.  again this this was perfect  Kabuli kebab : Amazing kebabs made out of chana and dry fruits..  Cheese aalo Tandoori ..  This was one More started that we ordered.That was baby potatoes Tandoori grilled and loaded with grated cheese and  tasted heavenly..  Tandoori baby kulcha : Tiny kulcha Made in Indian style and stuffed with Mozzarella cheese...  Kadai pasta  This is from thier special fusion menu.. Penne pasta tossed in a traditional Indian gravy... Never though this fusion could be this good..  Veg thali : The consisted of 4 gravy and 1 salad and raithathe vegetable pulao. The pulao fastest very good..  They have 2 separate thali for weekdays and weekends... For a weekday thali  you get around 4 for gravy and for the weekend Thali you get around 6 gravy also the price will vary accordingly  Now coming to Desert We ended our meal with Anjeer Ka Halwa, it a dessert made with fig and tasted good.. we also had the most amazing combination of jalebi rabdi.. i surely can't stop at one.. I also tried the Delhi special lassi...  Overall experience that food was great... Never though being a non vegetarian I will a vegetarian food so much and it was amazing.. I would suggest it's a perfect place to dine in with family or friends...  Live long... Never eat wrong                                             purnisfoodblog.winkl.in"
3.5,"I enjoy different cuisines and that's quite obvious from the amount I eat out and of course review them. But I can be very fussy with certain cuisines and North Indian unfortunately falls into that category. I love certain dishes and if it's not done right I can be very blunt in my reviews and also quite disappointed hence I am selective about the restaurants who offer North Indian cuisine.  One such restaurant I have come across is Delhi Highway. Though I have passed this restaurant numerous times in the last year and visited all other restaurants around it, I really never thought about trying them out.  An opportunity came my way recently when I had to meet some friends who were mainly vegetarian and the meet up was convenient for all in Indira Nagar. It was a weekday dinner and we were all meeting after office hence it was around by the time all of us got together. Being located on the busy 12th Main Road they have valet which is a plus.  The restaurant has a royal and majestic feel which is visible from the outside itself and is quite impressive when you enter with its gold lined walls, marble floors and wood decor which one cannot miss. We decided to occupy the upstairs seating on the divan / bench as we were a big group.  We started our meal with a Frozen Mint Mojito which was soothing especially after a hard day's work and traffic. One of us took the reins on ordering and the Mojito was followed by a tangy and mildly spicy Tomato Dhania Shorba. Since we were catching up after a long time we were quite engrossed in our own conversations when the appetizers were served. Though I do not recollect which order our starters were served I do remember the quirky presentation of the Cone Masala Papad which tasted very good. Among the starters we ordered for Pani Puri, Achari Paneer Tikka, Naram dil Kebab, Bhala Papdi Chat, Charcoal Mushroom and Brocholli Pesto Tikki. While all the starters were good, I especially liked the Achari Paneer Tikka and Naram dil Kebab which I understand is one of their signature dishes. The Pani Puri is more of a fusion version being served with different panis ranging from Cranberry to Mango to the usual flavours. Their chats are all well prepared and served in a jiffy on order. Another dish which we ordered on insistance by our attender was the Mini Kulchas. This was the best dish ordered and tasted heavenly. A note of warning, this is not a dish for the health conscious!  After filling ourselves with loads of starters, I knew I cannot miss their Thali and we ordered ourselves a few thalis, with some of the ladies in the group deciding to share their thalis. Their Thali looks absolutely mouth watering and inspite of being quite full, I managed to have quite a bit of their thali which included Dum Biryani, Ghee Rice, Pindi Chana, Paneer Lababdar, Dal Makhni, Malai Kofta, Kadai Paneer and Raita. While I really liked the thali as a whole, my standout dishes were the dum biryani and Paneer Lababdar.  Though I do not have much of a sweet tooth especially the North Indian variety of sweets, my friends decided to go ahead and order Jalebi with Rabdi and Anjeer Halwa. The jalebi looked sumptuous and I could not stop myself from devouring a few. I did try a spoon of the halwa which I found a bit too sweet for my taste though very rich. Some of us needed something to wash our heavy meal down and lassi came to our rescue. A very well prepared lassi of the right consistency ended our meal on a happy note.  The prices are a bit on the higher side and I am sure that mainly due to the kind of ingredients used and the quality of food served to their patrons.  We had a lot of fun at the get together and I am glad to say that our choice of restaurant and food made it a memorable one. Delhi Highway is one of the few vegetarian restaurants which has left a lasting impression and is a great place for friends as well as family. rjheartnsoul.com"
3.5,"The place defines family time. It's a good place for a family get together or a dinner. The food is tasty but spicy so in case anyone not used to spice, inform them before hand. The service is really fast and good. The must try is the jalebi wd rabri and also the dahi sheekh kebab :)"
4.0,Amazing ambience and yummy food!! Their thali is too good! From the first drink they serve to the items in the thali! Oh my! I must say real good North Indian food!   So If you want to relish some good North Indian food then you know where to head to! Cheers!

5.0,"A fabulous place for some excellent North Indian food and true, authentic Delhi style Kulchas. Visited the place for dinner on a Monday evening, the place was empty and quiet (though people came in a bit later). We ordered the Badam Shorba (a different type of nice taste), Sizzling Platter and Tandoori Fresh Farm for starters  both the dishes were truly amazing and well cooked.  For the main course it was a mix of regular North Indian fare for the elders in the group  again well cooked, delectable taste and not at all heavy on the oil or masalas.  The younger lot choose a variety of fusion food  Sizzling Mutter Kulcha (authentic Delhi street style Kulchas), Fulka Tacos and Mozarella Kulchas  all of them sent our taste buds to high heavens.  The service was extremely helpful  kudos to Biswajeet and Rehman. Keep It up!!!"
4.5,"Have been to many North Indian joints but this one here is a real deal. Packed with flavours and variety of food is just impeccable. From dahi Vada to Pani Puri, from dahi ke kabab till rabdi Jalebi, it just can't get better than this.   Little higher on prices but value for money is spot on. We tried thali which comes with best of almost everything they have to offer. The thali was mean mountain of calories but that's what you have to sacrifice to taste a real good food.  My report card Price  6/10 Taste  8/10 Service  9/10 Ambience  7/10 Value for money  8/10 Will I go back  Will might even come here just for sweets"
2.5,"The service is waaaay too slow. Even if you have been seated and attended to by the waiter with your order, if a larger group sits down much after you, they will be served first. The waiters don't even seem to understand what's being asked of them. A thali which my mum ordered took 45 minutes and about as many reminders to the waiter to arrive in its entirety.  The food is very average. Many of the dishes on the menu are there in lesser expensive restaurants in town. Nothing remarkable in the paneer dishes I ordered, the naan was ok. Definitely not a standout restaurant to me. And the poor service before and during the meal will ensure that i'll never go back.  The two reasons it got as much as a 2.5 rating? It's vegetarian, and one of the nicer waiters returned the pair of glasses I left on the table when I was getting into my car."
4.0,"If you want to have some Hot & spicy Hyderabadi Biryani, Delhi Highway is the restaurant to be at. Good service, high ceilings & royal look makes the overall experience even better."
2.5,"Well went to this place with a lot of expectation but was very disappointed. Though we had reservation done we had to wait as the staff was clueless . Once we got settled we decided to try out their Thali . Its a basic expectation from any hotel to serve water as soon as guest settled in but we were not served water till mid way through our main course that too after requesting them multiple times. The food was just about Ok. The starters were good.The dal in the Thali was just about fine. The aloo gobhi was better of the lot. They serve rice just for namesake in the Thali. Mixed veg and panner tasted the same. After repeated requests the rotis came. The staff seemed to be always in a hurry and never bother to attend to you. After our main course as we wait for the dessert ,one of the guys comes in and hands us over the bill oblivious to the fact that dessert is not served. No coordination among the staff themselves. Then we remind him that desserts are not served which then come in 2 small bowls after like waiting for eternity. Try avoiding the place as they might just spoil your mood with their pathetic service and mediocre food."
4.5,I had visited here for my friend's bday the food was good . With great ambiance. A must visit place for the vegetarians.  Service - 4/5 Food - 5/5 Ambiance - 5/5.
5.0,"I have found the best place to have north indian food in Bangalore and it is - Delhi Highway. Have tried both a la carte and buffet here. And both experiences were amazing, though i liked buffet more. The food is just perfect and each and every dish is delicious! The buffet is very elaborate with multiple courses.  The ambience is also very royal. It looks like a palace with golden and blue colours. The crockery is beautiful and very heavy.  The service it good, and if you reach there with sufficient time in hand, you can enjoy the meal with leisure.  Table booking recommended.  Overall i would love to visit Delhi Highway again and again and again...."
2.5,"We visited Delhi highway because we had heard about their authentic desserts and wanted to try them. So I'll start with that. We ordered the Gulab Jamoon and Shahi Tukhda and asked them to bring it first. It arrived only halfway through our main course. So it was cold by the time we ate it. The jamoon was extremely sweet and had more than a generous amount of dry fruits on it. It was too decadent for my liking. Whereas the Shahi Tukhda was spectacular. One of the best I've had.  For starters, we had the roasted papad that was served stacked on top of each other. So the papad in between onion layers was completely soggy. Pathetic plating and presentation.  For mains, we had the Pav Bhaji. For the prices they charge, they sure do economize with their portions. They gave us pav which was cut in half. When questioned about it, they layer brought another piece. We also had the Methi paratha and Aloo paratha combo which was pretty good.  The staff kept taking away our plates and bowls like they were in such a hurry. It didn't make sense since the restaurant wasn't even full. Half of them do not understand English, so you're forced to converse in Hindi to explain your needs.  All in all, it was an average meal. Seems like they've spent a lot on the lavish interiors and nothing else. Wouldn't recommend the place. I'm sure you'll find much better Indian restaurants at prices that aren't so taxing on your pocket."
3.5,"We want to have good veg dinner and we chose Delhi highway. We opted for veg thali. Starters are good except few kabab items. Service was slow even if there were less ppl in the restaurant. Main course was good, price is bit high compare to other place where they are serving similar cuisine. Ambience wise its awesome."
5.0,"Ambience was very welcoming. Bright lights, good seating arrangement. Perfect and controlled temperature of The AC. Food was delicious. Paneer was so soft it almost melted in my mouth. Perfect blend of spices. Service was very good. Fast and prompt waiters. The waiter was very helpful in suggesting what's good. Worth the money spent. Would highly recommend."
5.0,I went with my family this place so everything  was excellent and  I choose this place and ambiance and all staffs bcz all experience was excellent and food was very tasty so I will planning for next time withmy office staffs.
3.5,Too expensive for a veg food .. need to have more innovation if you want to maintain the price  and survive in the market . Food wise good food but at that price it's a one time
5.0,"Delhi se Dilli tak! 2nd foodgasm I've had in Bangalore was in Delhi Highway. The starters, main course and the desert. Oh God that Jalebi with Rabdi... 10/10 would visit this place again. And with friends and family and colleagues and whoever I can find to have an really awesome meal."
1.0,Pathetic experience  It's just show off from outside Food isn't good at all! Within minutes of order the food is served and not very hot Very expensive for the ambience Charged 100rs extra for rice which I noticed when I came home! Please stop cheating people with jus good interiors Please don't visit this  Vegetarian food is 100 times in many places in Bangalore
4.0,"Best place to gorge on some authentic North Indian food, and you will be satisfied. The prices at decent and the ambience is also really good."
3.5,"Interior is eye catching. Service is excellent, the employees are very polite. Restroom is very clean but small.  Food is good, but price is very hight. The taste isn't up to the mark for the price they change."
2.5,"Impressive structure of the place from outside, but the interiors don't suit the outside (seemed down market when seated in).   Torn menu cards. Excessive staff just walking around loosely all over.   Food makes up for the cons above. Spicy and pretty Delhi like. Though some items seemed stale and just poorly reheated and served. (Delhi aloo tiki chat was one such example).   Better options to try around. But do visit, if you don't get a reservation else where. Not bad on the food taste."
4.5,"ambience - excellent  Food - excellent   Had been here on Sunday .. The place was fully occupied .  The staff was polite enough and we waited for almost an hour ..   For a paneer fan ,  Naram dil kebab and the paneer tikka are just the thing I crave for !   It's spacious and decent enough for a family meal . A must visit place ."
3.5,"Was catching up with a friend for dinner, and we were badly craving for some good old Punjabi food to fill our stomach. We landed up at Horn ok Please which apparently has shut! So we were walking on the Indiranagar road until we finally landed at Delhi Highway. The yellow lights looked so grand and gave me a very royal, palace kind of feel.  Ambience: 4.5/5 We entered and there was a sitting area below and a floor above. It was intricately decorated with a majestic touch and when combined with the pretty yellow lights, it looked extremely stunning. The crowd was also buzzing with families and couples (on a Monday night!) so it was good.  Food: 3.5/5 We were sure of what we wanted to eat, so did not experiment much and passed the buffet which was about 600Rs. We started with Dan Sunehri, a dal with the right amount of spices and tadka; I definitely enjoyed it. Then we called for Jeera Rice, Tandoori roti and Boondi raita to accompany it. They both were decent. Having a craving for something sweet, we ordered the Rabdi Jalebi; the jalebi was extremely delicious, cooked the right amount, with a lovely crunch, and the rabdi was pretty nice too! I would definitely visit again to try out their other items which looked promising.  Staff: 3/5 The staff was courteous but the food came very slow; we were starving!  I want to try out more dishes here and then would give a more full-fledged review.                                             stylepsychic.in"
1.5,"Offer of the Week: Find hair in the food and get 20% off...  Visited the restaurant on 2-jun.  Well yeah. Their so called famous platter had hair in the food. It simply got replaced with a fresh dish again. No apology; no explanation offered; but a 20% off on the bill.  The waiters & order takers don't have a clue on the menu. I ask them what they recommend on a starter or spicy gravy, and the answer is ""this is the menu"".  Roti was just so ordinary; don't know why it is charged so much.  Platter has different varieties of panneer in it. ""Different"" only by colour. But the potatoes tasted really nice. Well that was the only item that actually had a taste. So called spicy, lahori panneer gravy, was just a normal curry in tomato base."
1.5,"Sunday lunch turned out to be very mediocre. Under staffed, the person taking our order was grouchy the whole while. Staff was deaf ear-ed to most of our requests. Food was extremely spicy, specially the starters. We ordered the thali and were disappointed thoroughly. Food was served lukewarm. Biryani was under done. The only saving grace was the rotis. We were not served seconds, though we were told the thali was unlimited. Frankly, we lost the appetite to even try some dishes, halfway through lunch. While we could understand their hardship in carrying food from the ground floor kitchen to us, as we're seated in the 1st floor, but it took them forever to serve the food.  If very hungry n contemplating on trying this place, I'd say please think twice and take the plunge."
3.5,"Being from Delhi, anything named to it always fascinates me and this place lives up to the expectations. This is one of the most crafty and beautiful building in Indiranagar with all Mughal fort like structure and internal ambience. With yellow hue all around and waiters in dress, this place provides a royal dining experience. Ordered dal tadka, Shahi mughali paneer, roti and rice. For beverage ordered virgin mojito and aam Panna. Aam Panna was bad, virgin mojito good. Daal was kind of overspicy and overloaded with masalas, however gave the north indian feel. But Shahi paneer did the deed. Exactly Delhi like regular restaurant taste, Shahi paneer here is a must try. Roti were soft and good, however shocked to see rumali roti priced at 110 bucks. Rice were fresh and good. Service was good and dishes delivered to our tables on time. The place is expensive. Will visit again.                                                                  instagram.com"
4.0,"I heared about this From my fried so today visit here with family ambience is royal and food make us feel we are  at home town. We had tried dahi kebab,dal makhani with butter naan . All were okay. Service is pretty good and staff attitude is good. So like visit again. This place is better for north Indian food as well as for vegetarians."
4.0,Came here after recommendation from lot of them.... dint find anything really special... it's just authentic Delhi food... we were two of us and filled our tummies with only starters most of them were good... will probably have to come back to explore their main course
4.5,"The place opened up fairly recently. Ambience is royal and gives the mughali feel. Staff was courteous. Being a Punjabi, trust my word, the food is worth it. Had dahi kabab, mushrooms, Raj kachori: perfect in every bite. The dal makhni, served in a copper balti exactly like they like to serve up north, was a dream come true and I cried coz I couldn't finish it as I was that full. The Hari chutney, as we like to call it, Amla achar, achari mirch, everything was perfect.  It's definitely a go-to place for vegetarian north indian food."
2.5,"Wanted to visit this place since long, had high expectations I guess.. Looks promising but not a great value for money, liked the decor though.."
4.0,"My family had Friday dinner in Delhi Highway. I'd heard a lot about this place and was my first choice for a dinner place. The name of the restaurant can be quite deceptive because it was a completely different scene when we reached the place.  It was really beautiful from the outside and the ambience inside just kept adding to the wow factor. The royal ambience really brought back fond memories from all my visits to Delhi.   We ordered Charcoal Mushrooms, Tandoori Fresh Farm and Indo Mexican Quesadillas for starters. I'll admit that it was a bit too much and also put in a side note not to order any other starter if you're going for a platter because the quantity is way too much. The mushrooms and vegetables were excellent and they prepare the dishes considering your choice of veggies too (if you request it). The soup (corn and spinach soup) was simply superb. However I wouldn't advice ordering the quesadillas for fans of Mexican food because according to me- paneer, cheese and beans just don't go well together!!  The Ragda patties we ordered were on the spicier side and we had to order dessert in the middle of the meal just to cool our taste buds The gulab jamun was tasty but a little hard. The main course was average and so was the pricing.  This place is a must visit for people who have a thing for paneer dishes. You'll just be surprised at the variety of dishes it offers(I think every dish has paneer). The staff was courteous. My only request of them would be to inform people if they've ordered way too many starters :):) Will definitely visit this place again with a bigger crowd!"
4.0,North Indian cuisine is something to look out for here.. the decor is also amazing.. a little heavy on the pocket but the food and the ambiance justifies the cost. Overall a nice experience :D
4.5,The place is beautiful. The ambience and food is perfectly as I expected. Must try the mozzarella Kulcha. The service is great :) had a great time. Keep up the good work.
3.0,"Delhi Highway in Bangalore..!! Posh looking place..Different menu from a normal veg restaurant..!! Visited the place on it's opening week..that too on a Sunday But pathetic waiters..bad service.. They made us wait for more than 40mins even when 7-8 tables were empty..Probably to give us a feeling that how crowded their place is and there is so much que.. We saw a waiter dipping his finger in the green chutney and licking it..when we asked later for another bowl, he got a bowl from some other table, half eaten, cleaned the corner with tissue and shamelessly served us.. The food was good, different..but the management really need to buckle up..just wearing walkie-talkie doesn't make you a great restaurant..!!"
2.0,Never go for Thalia..bad experience. Service too slow...we ask for things twice then got it...very bad experience....people used to serve as if they r giving free food.
4.5,"I visited yesterday for my team lunch and I must say I was really happy with the taste and the ambience.We ordered the Thali which had so much to offer. There was a welcome drink which was a mint flavored and sweet. They had put the best of kebabs in the platter and all were of different taste. The best part was the dessert which was a simple rice pudding and mung dal halwa. Everything was served in very good portions and they had asked us to repeat if any of these. Though I am non-vegetarian, but I love the vegetarian food which was of such variety. The ala- carte menu also looked very innovative. I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking out for a vegetarian platter to impress someone or even for a perfect family dinner or lunch. The ambience is beautiful and they have tried to build a royal look and it looks fabulous. So anyone looking out for vegetarian food, i would recommend highly. P.S.- They took special orders to cook Jain food. So it's a big thums up!"
3.5,Clean and tidy restaurant and sterling service. Food is good with quality and quantity and can be tried. price is little more. Overall good experience.
4.0,Its a beautifully decorated restaurant.The ambience is that of a small palacial kind of.The Food served is fusion kind of with north indian elements like sizzler chole kulche.Dahi ke kebab is a must try
1.5,"Visited this place yesterday and I must say I was totally disappointed with the overall experience when compared to my first visit, which was about 2 months ago!. The ambience is beautiful and the place looks very fancy, but the food was an utter letdown a.k.a ""Never judge a book by its cover""! To summarize my experience: -ambience was great -service is good -food is not great and does not live up to the expectation. Firstly, while placing the order, the staff said no for a lot of dishes we would have liked to try. So, somehow with great difficulty we managed to order some stuff. A few things I would like to highlight here are   pani Puri- great for a starter! we really liked it and the way it was served was funky!    Chole bature- only main course dish which tasted good!    tandoori rolls chimichuri with salsa - extremely spicy and lacked proper description in the menu, turned out to be a paneer dish, had we known would have avoided it!    buttermilk- very bitter in taste, more like it was made from spoilt/old curd and when we asked them they did not agree.   Jal jeera - very salty and tasted yuck!   Gali parathe wali - absolute disappointment, looks like they bought the readymade ID parota(which also I guess must be old and beyond expiry, since it tasted sour), heated it and just sprinkled dried methi to call it Gali methi paratha  -Menu lacks proper description for all the dishes. Due to this reason, most of the dishes we ordered ended up being paneer dishes! The staff also are not able to explain clearly what each dish is! Please do mention the contents of the dish more clearly rather than using a million adjectives to describe the taste!   Overall experience not that great. Neither would I go back once more nor would I recommend this place to others!"
2.0,"On line order for 750rs for 2 tandoori roti, 1 mix kulcha, 1 biryani and 1 diwani subzi deserve some respect when it comes to packaging.  It looks like as if it was ordered from some road side hawker !  @ management If home delivery is not your forte then please accept it don't go for it till you fix it. Because it is ruining your hard earned name. Order was delayed by almost one and half hour as delivery guy had incorrect address. It ruins the over all experience of weekend dinner.  My advise DON'T OPT FOR HOME DELIVERY !"
5.0,One of the best pure vegetarian restaurant in Bangalore with a royal ambience and courteous staff. All preparations are outstanding. The best thing amongst all was their fresh pickle and mirch they serve on every table. It was really yummy and reminded me my grandma. Aam pana which was pulpy and quite fresh. Palak lasuni paneer was also yummy with really fresh cottage cheese in it. Quantity served for each dish was quite generous and sufficient for 2 people. Good work people.
4.5,"It really reminds me of my North Indian food. Whenever i miss it, I visit here. Staff is very friendly and kind of foodie like me cz they know what they are serving"
3.5,"Been here for my birthday. Great ambience , serving was good , extremely over priced and food wasn't that tasty. They almost forgot to serve a dish and  we had to cancel it"
4.0,"Lavish Treat for Vegetarians!!!   Ambience is Modern yet aesthetic north Indian Experience, Interiors is an epitome of luxurious dining, it gives a feel of a Mughal emperors Dining hall with Ceiling carvings, Lighting and seats  Lots of staff around, But the Service is glitchy. Initially the manager welcomes you with a big smile , and then if you are lucky enough you will be treated Royally, Sadly I was not !!!  I had an experience with a Grouch PAPPU who was in a bad mood, served food with displeasure and handed over the THALI in my hand instead of Serving on the Table.  Suggest to go in for Thali which includes welcome drink, Soup, Masala Papad , Pani puri, Dahi Papdi, Starters , main course & desserts. Enjoyed each course and cant get over it   Aamla pickle is mind blowing rarely available in the restaurants. Paneer is succulent and Fresh, I can say the best paneer I have ever had. Starters are the show stealers Naram Dil kebab is my favorite it melts in mouth, Pulao is just perfectly spiced with veggies cooked to perfection and desserts are incredibly tasty   Not a place to go if you are in a hurry!! Have pleasing north Indian sumptuous meal which will make your day if you are a FOODIE   Ambience  5/5  Service  2.5/5  Food  4.5/5  Value for money  4/5"
4.0,"One of the finest vegetarian restaurant which  serves authentic North Indian food .The place is quite big , spacious with royal interiors . We ordered special thali and each items in the menu was well prepared and delicious .Well on the pricing it is on the higher side  . Service is decent .Will definitely visit again ."
3.5,"We went to Delhi Highway for dinner for my parents wedding anniversary.  It was also the first time for all of us. The ambience, as everyone has mentioned , is great. Music could be better. On the food - we ordered the tomato dhania shorba which was very watery; compensated well with dahi sheekh  kabab which was very tasty. The masala pappads  were nice fresh and crunchy.  On the main course the butter rotis were light and nice. The diwani  handi  was a huge disappointment and the paneer pasanda was passable.  We didn't order desserts. Overall some specific dishes I think are good in taste but not all on the menu. In comparison, Tandoori  Taal  is certainly a more fresh and tastier option if veg and non veg options on the palette are fine."
4.5,Gur authentic North Indian. V good ambience and service.  Their thali lunch is worth it. Good option in Indiranagar for Veg north Indian food.
5.0,"They have wide variety of North Indian Food.. Prices are reasonable, and the ambience is too good. All the staff's are very responsible and humble too."
5.0,"Grand palace like restaurant with great food, lovely ambience and great hospitality. One of the best thali serving joint. A must visit place if you're a thali lover."
3.5,Decent place for north Indian food and Fusion food.  The mocktails are okay -ish. And starters are manageable. Ambience is good. Service is just okay.  I'd not rate this place 5 stars cuz it wasn't the best places I've been to in town.
3.0,"I Zomatoed Delhi Highway before zeroing in on it. I assumed an interesting Delhi highway dhabaesque ambience and was a wee bit surprised when it looked more like Delhi Durbar with its jharokhas (decorative windows) and plush sofa seating.  We had Tandoori Aloo and Papad churi for starters. The Aloo was soft, tangy and tasty but what caught my fancy was the churi which was crushed pappad mixed with salt and chilli powder. It was crisp, tasty, light and easy on the palate.   For main course we had Diwani handi, Aloo Gobhi and Langar waali dal with Tandoori rotis.  What deserves special mention is the Diwani handi. A spiced pot pourri of vegetables and cottage cheese cooked to perfection.   Two interesting USPs of DH would be that it is probably the only Punjabi restaurant serving pure vegetarian food and they serve generous portions probably for the big Indian family.  To elicit a top two rating from me, the food should be distinctive, balanced and leave me wanting to go back there soon. DH lost out on these counts.  So, until next time eat moderately and allow disruption in food. You never know!!!"
4.0,Royal Ambience ! Delhi style Food ! Service ! But all Vegetarian Still Full marks for all these... Making Family Dinner Plan...Do check out this place
4.5,"When I first saw Delhi Highway it went straight on the top of my must try list. Then I realized that is a pure veg restaurant, so it got deprioritized. However, recently we got a chance to visit the place.  Parking: there is no dedicated parking but there is valet. The problem with the valet is that most people would be on the wrong side of the road when coming from Indiranagar and would find it hard to attract the attention of the valet. Best thing would be to take an Uber.  Ambiance: The place has a royal feel with with the double staircase and the all gold and blue facade. It really feels like a palace.  Service: The staff is warm and courteous. The famous Indian Meheman nawazi can be experienced here.  Food: The food here is pure vegetarian, but that is not a limiting factor in the menu and there are tons of options to choose from. We took the Dahi k Kabab, Sizzling Chola Kulcha, Laisooni Palak Paneer, Butter Naan and Rumali Roti. We also wanted to order Pav Bhaji, but the waiter told us that they order it from outside and their vendor was off on that day... now I don't know if he meant they get only the Pav from outside or if they have outsourced the whole dish (I really hope it is the former).  About what we ordered, the Kababs were a bit dry and it felt more like paneer than dahi. Everything else was almost perfect. the Chola came on a sizzler plate with bread like kulchas and Laisooni panner palak had really soft cottage cheese with a generous dose of garlic.  The Naan and Rumali roti was also pretty good with generous amounts of butter on the Naan.   Overall: The experience was nice, however we did over order one dish because the waiter told us that the Chola kulcha would be served as a starter while it was large enough to be a meal for 2. This is a great place specially if you are ever missing true North Indian food."
3.5,"A Perfect Family Place.   This restaurant is on the 12th Main Road in Indiranagar and from outside it looks grand because of its palace style interiors with glass in front. Seriously, it gives you a feeling as if you're looking at a Suraj Barjatya's movie set!   Okay, so jokes apart, here goes the review -  Ambience - I went there for dinner on a Friday evening and it was bit crowded. It is recommended that you book a table if you want to avoid waiting for at least half an hour. The golden  interiors make you feel like you're in a grand place. Nice work done there. They have sofas and chairs for the guests who are waiting, which means you don't have to stand and wait for your table. That's one good thing I guess. Their wall decors, the tables and the uniform of their waiters, everything complements the ""grand"" palace theme of the restaurant  but not sure why the name was given ""Delhi Highway"" and the theme was decided as a Rajasthan Palace for this place.   They play decent music in the background which is not very loud, making it easy for the guests to talk to each other.  Service - Their manager is very courteous and the staff is very decent. Service is very fast.  Food - They have plenty of options in food along with stuffed parathas and some chinese items as well. Their lassi is very tasty but I felt that it is way too overpriced for the quantity that they serve. Jaljeera is okay. We ordered Veg Seekh Kabab for starters and it was good. Their stuffed paratha was tasty. Tomato soup was really good.  So overall the food is not very amazing but they serve really good food and one can plan a visit to this place as far as the food quality and quantity is concerned.  Pricing - It is a bit high on the price but you won't feel that they are overcharging for anything (except lassi) as the ambience, service and food everything is good.   If you're a Tandoori Taal lover and confused between Delhi Highway and Tandoori Taal, go for T.T. but do have this restaurant in your list for the next time  But if you're someone who prefers pure vegetarian restaurant only, then this one tops the list giving a sophisticated experience at the end of the day (of course Gramin is the best pure veg restaurant I have been to till now but its ambience cannot be compared with this one!)"
3.0,"Visited Delhi Highway yesterday night, Thankfully peaceful ride all the way in the mild rain . Ordered corn and spinach soup along with sizzling platter. Soup tasted like coconut gravy. the platter , good quantity , but was very spicy. the dilli mashoor aloo tikki chat was comparatively enjoyable.  In the main course , the diwani handi and shahi paneer was quantitative and made up for earlier misses, especially Diwani Handi. The service is very indifferent. Guys , wake up. you may be getting crowds. but poor service is a big letdown."
1.5,"My experience at Delhi highway was bad  The welcome drink was in a tiny glass , two sips & it's over ,the soup was very sharp , full of chillies  The snacks were ok but when asked for more , did not get it  Then came the main food , total disaster , very few items , only four , plain curd ,badly cut salad , two sweets , both tasteless & very little quantity , on the whole it's a avoid place , not worth the money"
3.5,This place has a very different ambience. Can't say if I loved it or hated it . It's very open and spacey . Yet the number of people waiting outside made it very crowded .  Food was ok . Nothing special . But I'd visit this place again if I'm looking for a once a month place . Price is on the higher side but with the correct order one may be able to save money as well. They desperately need to train their staff for a better experience.  Jai Hind
4.0,"We planned a sudden visit to this restaurant on a Saturday evening for dinner, we went bit early so it wasn't crowded. The Place , the decor and a good decent north food were nice. We got Charcoal Mushroom as starters & Indo mexcian Quesadillas for main course both were YUM YUM. Thou the price are little high. A good place to visit and try good food."
4.0,"For all those who crib for North Indian food in Bangalore, this place is not less than heaven. Firstly their ambience is quite pretty and gives you the feel of luxury dining. Secondly their food is super yum irrespective of what you order. From starters to dessert it is a blissful package all the way be the taste or the presentation or the service. Strongly recommend especially if you wanna treat your parents:))"
4.0,"Not located on the highway but at a very good location in Indiranagar......  This restaurant has a very good mughlai ambience....the glasses the cutlery all made of copper which gives a very good look and feel of shahi meal. The service was also good with very humble staff.  The menu has many varieties of vegetarian dishes which includes authentic pubjabi foods and some fusion dishes also. The menu also provides a good choice of deserts and mocktails. Unfortunately thalli was not available during dinner but combos were available.  In starters we ordered fried masala papad,  Dahi kebab and shahi veg kebab. The hero was the Dahi kebabs it was soft inside with a nice masala of veggies and yoghurt and it was rightly fried from outside. In main course we ordered the Indian breads ( tandoor roti and butter naans ) ,paneer lahori, pindi chana and the diwani handi.  All curries were good but the pindi chana and the diwani handi were too good. The diwani handi was a very good dish with right blend of veggies and paneer   with a palak gravy.  Overall a very good dinner experience with the food and ambience."
4.0,"It is hard to find a pure vegetarian punjabi restaurant. so when we found this place, it was our obvious choice for this weekend. And tell you what, it did not disappoint me at all. They serve melt in the mouth paneer . Paneer lababdaar was good. Rajma was surprisingly very tasty ( I have been trying rajma chawal everywhere in Bangalore but couldn't find any better than this). We skipped dessert and instead went for our milkshake nearby.  Next visit happened a few days back and this time we tried their fusion food. I must say it did not disappoint me at all. Their mozzarella kulcho is indeed tasty and something I never had before ever.. jalebi rabari is must try."
5.0,"Delhi Highway is undoubtedly one of the best veg restaurants in Bangalore. The ambience at the restaurant is commendable . The restaurant is made in such a way that it radiates royalty as soon as you step in. Now let's get to the most important aspect ; The food! The food at Delhi Highway is unlike any other in the city . Providing an ample size menu boasting of mouthwatering fusion dishes as well as typical desi ones . We started our course with the Naram File Kebabs , which were literally the best kebabs we have ever had . This is coming from a non vegetarian by the way, so you can imagine how good they were .  This was followed by the pani Puri shots which were a delightful yet interesting snack . We then had the Makai Sarso with Buffalo Cheese . The Sarso ka Sag was amazing with ample spice and tingled our taste buds in the best way possible.  The Paneer Tikka and the Kadia Pasta was also worthy of a try . The latter was a commendable effort at fusion food , which is quite the craze these days. Finally , we ended our meal with Paneer Lababdar and some Mozzarella Kulchas . It was a satisfying end to our fantastic experience at this restaurant . The price point of this restaurant is quite high but satisfactory for the quality of food . I would recommend you get a reservation . You will most probably not end up getting a seat if you decide to go there last minute .  All - in - all, a must visit !!!"
3.5,"Located bang on the 12th main road, Delhi Highway is hard to go unnoticed when in Indiranagar. They have humongous set up and can accommodate quite a good number of guests.   I was here for dinner and hence ate ala carte. Although I have heard that they have good Thali buffets. I found the ala carte menu bit overpriced. The food was tasty but it was nothing out of the world (Since it cost me a bomb, I am entitled to expect heavenly food on my plate). Anyways the ambience is good and specially at night it looks really fancy and blingy.  We had a starter platter, and everything on it was delicious. There was Tandoori Gobhi, Paneer Tikka, Dahi Kabab, etc. They had few yummy condiments on every table (Like they have pickles on every table).  For main course we had Paneer Kulcha, Naan, Laccha Paratha, Palak Lehsuni Paneer and Malai kofta. Like I said, food was good but the price along with the taxes was too much.  But overall a good experience.   P.S. Rating is subject to change, after I try the buffet."
4.0,"This restaurant was a wonderful experience.... the place is much bigger than what you see in pictures .  The food was delicious .  We went ahead and ordered a thali .  After all - that's what eating is all about :)  Not too over priced , the thali had quite a spread.   The slight disappointment was that , the second serving came a little too late . But I guess , their paneer tikka was worth waiting for ."
3.5,"Went there for a Valentine's day dinner as my wifes a vegetarian. Food was fine, but maybe due to crowd, the service was poor. The starters were good, the main course decent but dessert should improve. I had to wait half hour for an extra jalebi!. Overall, my experience was good but not great."
3.5,After visiting the Delhi Highway restaurant in mumbai I was expecting a similar good dinner at this indira nagar outlet..but it was far away from my previous experience! First of all..this place is a chaos..no place to park and the valet is super confused and busy..lucily we had our table reserved else we saw people arguing at the reception desk! And once you settle down the place is so noisy that you can either forget about chatting with your family or you can scream on top of your voice! Coming to the food..we asked for masala papad and mocktails before we could decide on the meal..the masala papad had only onions and 1 or 2 chunks of tomato thrown in..mocktails were highly sugary and very watery. Paneer tikka platter was good and so were the pani puris. Tomato shorba was perfectly spicy and tasty. The paneer paratha they serve is amazing and a must have is their paneer cooked in delhi style. So the food is definitely good but the overall experience will not leave a lasting impression.
1.0,First of all the landline no on zomato is totally wrong. The staff are also unaware about it  They claim their phone is idle then how come we didn't receive your call..  The@y wanted us to prove that it's their uploading fault.. after giving them proof they are like what do we do.. we don't know.. not hotel fault. . You should have tried calling proper number.. Now wait for an hour...  sick...   Total dissapointment  Just walked out of that place..
4.0,"Went here during our journey to explore new places every weekend. The theme of the restaurant is quite fascinating. We loved the ambiance. Coming to the main point, i.e. food, food was good. In fact, I got to eat the best Dal Makhani, so far I could find in Bangalore. The price is on higher side but the food is good."
4.5,"The best thing about this place is ambience.It is having a great Mughal era look.The music played adds beauty to the look of the place.Yeah it's a  place for taking your date on a lunch.  Pros: 1)The theme , ambience 2)Music played ,takes you back to delhi mughal era 3)Service is good  Cons: 1)Food is okay . Charges are high"
5.0,"We have been there a couple of times. Their matar kulcha is a must try, along with paratha combo ( methi, aloo, gobhi- all were great) In main course- do try the langarwali dal along with paneer lababdar  We tried the fixed menu thali once- tamatar dhaniya shorba and starters were great. I loved it that they don't serve too huge portions in the first time while serving the thali Dishes I didn't like too much - Chole Bhature( they need their Chole be have a black texture, and there is very less salt in bhatura), also Tomato soup was just ok"
5.0,One of the finest restaurants North Indian Food restaurant. Had a very good experience including food taste and service. Only problem is that is a vegetarian restaurant
5.0,One is the best place for buff and specially the manager -Saroj Pradhan and his co maksadul is really amazing the way they service is really and makes you feel homely !! And the food is so fresh and clean and music is so soothing !!
4.0,"The restaurant has a royal interior and good, spaced out seating. The service is good but slow. However, their incredibly delicous makes up for it. Delhi Highway is a heaven for vegetarians in town and I rate it a must try. I hogged on their Badam Shorba (Soup), Gali Parathe Wali Combo, #SheerMalRoti and #PaneerLababdaar for the main course and #JalebiRabdi for dessert. It was all delicious, expect for the Rabdi."
3.0,"Alert-this is a veg restaurant with no liquor.stuffed mushrooms n dahi kebab delicious. Dal makhani was average.Give their gali take parathe a pass.. special methi paratha,not quite special n mooli paratha too spicy for my liking n chole needs to be cooked until tender. The waiters need to be told that main course should be served after appetisers are finished and not in parallell!"
4.5,Had been here for lunch once with family. And what a lunch it was! Royal! We ordered special thali which was on Sunday and the variety was so much.  Be it starters like Pani Puri or main food like naan and dal Makhani and sweet dish like jalebi was just delicious. even their sweet lassi was to die for!  Will love this visit again and make my tummy happy
4.5,The restaurant looks so royal even from the outside. It is huge and spaced out. The paneer and biryani were damn good. The mix veg kulcha and tandoori roti were too soft. The staff was polite and quick! Loved this place totally.
4.5,"This place offers a great variety of North Indian (Veg only) food options, specially the desi version of their pastas are awesome. The watermelon Mojito was pretty looking and great to taste too. Service was quick and pricing is decent. Would recommend this place if you looking for a veg Indian dinning experience at the heart of Indiranagar.  Cheers!"
2.5,"Went here for lunch on a Sunday. We decided to go for the thali lunch which would cost you an all inclusive of Rs.750 + per head. Which I thought was wayyyyy tooo high for vegetarian food.  The next thing which I think should be brought to notice was the ergonomics of the furniture...either the chair was too high or the table too low...I'm not quite sure but it was uncomfortable...you would be bent over your food during the 1 hour plus time spent there. This position will put pressure over your stomach & intestines and make you very uncomfortable. Choose the tables with the sofa seating. The interiors of the place was nice and I liked the plates and cutlery...very rustic.  Now coming to the food...honestly I'm not a fan. There is a lot of variety but in terms of taste and flavour, nothing was memorable except the gulab jamun. Most times I found the food to be too salty which easily overshadows any flavour the chef meant to put across. This was a big turn off. I would rather have preferred a discreet spread packed with flavour, something I would crave for in the future. I definetly would not be visiting this place again.  I must mention the extremely promt and polite service. They don't rush you like most buffet places. You would be allowed to take your time finishing each course and waiters would politely ask you for seconds which is served to you almost immediately.  Overall...go for the ambience and tick a place off your list. Food wasn't that great for me and overpriced."
3.5,On a rainy Tuesday evening visited this place. The valet guy was well equipped with his umbrella to escort us out of the car.  A good menu spread. The guy taking our order was at times unable to comprehend what we where asking him. Nevertheless we went through with placing our order. The Chaat was good but found the puri's not upto the mark in the chaat. The paneer starter was amazing. Main course we had a mix vegetables which was so so. DAL was amazing. Good ambience. Will revisit this palace again to try out the Thali.
1.0,Very lousy food and service. First they get all the dishes very mild. On commenting about it the next dishes are dipped and rolled in full spice and made unbearable to eat. Need to improve a lot otherwise they will have to shut shop.
3.5,It's a nice place to have a weekend lunch with your family. I was satisfied with the food they provide but could have been better. The rotis were good.
4.0,I visited it for lunch. We ordered the Golgappas as starters. They came with various chutney fillings (very colourful) which were good. The Chhola Bhatura were not very oily and hit the spot. The tandoori rolls were really nice (melt in the mouth). The lassi was good but the helping could have been more. The gobhi parathas we ordered left something to be desired. Overall the food was average and the ambience was good. The staff was courteous and prompt. We had brought a birthday cake for one of us which they brought as told and packed away at end properly. The valet service was a help.  Prices are a tad higher than expected in my opinion for what's on offer. The restaurant is a welcome addition to dining options in Indiranagar
4.0,"Go there if you are like really really really hungry . Because their thali is huge and delicious too. Love the ambience, the staff is decent in behaviour. And food tastes so good reminds me of home. High recommendation!"
4.5,"Delhi Highway is a vegetarian restaurant serving North Indian cuisine. The food is tasty, not spicy and well presented. Staff is friendly. Cost reasonable. Ambience is great. Great place to go for a family dinner."
4.0,Went with office colleagues. Nice ambience. Pure veg.. Easy location. on main raod on 12th main. We opted thali.. Gole gappe was not up to mark.. others were good but did not satisfy with Gulab Jamoon. Overall Good food.. Paneer Dil kabab (veg) was excellent.
4.5,"One of the very few North Indian places that are purely vegetarian, this one does justice to the North Indian food. We ordered a mushroom and a paneer starter. They were both great to taste and the mushroom starter was spicy and a perfect blend of all the traditional North Indian masalas and the paneer starter was extremely soft and melted in the mouth like a dream.  We had mushroom soup which was pretty average. The rotis were thicker than I'd like and the paneer tikka was a good, filling subzi but could've been a little more spicy. The biryani was a great quantity and wasn't as perfect as the kind you get up North but wasn't entirely disappointing either."
3.0,"Hair in the dish we ordered, zeera in water tumbler, dirty sofa..bad service..the only saver was shahi paneer which was yummy..the ambience is average"
4.5,"At last visited this place (Delhi Highway, Indiranagar) with a few friends. First floor is the place to sit unless you have joint pains and need the bathroom (which is only at the ground level) mid-meal. They have a set platter which is tempting considering you can taste many things (and avoid making ""tough"" decisions from the menu). My friends chose the fixed menu and I chose Makai ki roti and Sarson ka saag. I enjoyed my one item immensely and others relished some of the items offered to them! Regardless of whether you are used to Delhi food or not, do spend a little time on the online menu, read reviews and talk to friends. That way you will know what to eat and cherish the experience much more. Al-a -carte may be a little more expensive for those who want to eat to bursting point but for most people one item is enough (both in terms of prices and portions)."
3.5,"Went with friends for lunch and ordered veg thali. Starters were good and main course was tasty as well.   Got all kinds of starters like stuffed papad, pani puri, dahi puri, veg sheek kabab, tandoori paneer, patties, etc. For main course they served roti/naan, veg biryani, three subzis, dal, raitha. Two sweets for dessert and lassi. There was some jazzy looking blue coloured welcome drink as well.  The place was raided by kitty party gang of 20 odd people and they made such a noise that we did not really enjoy our lunch.  Staff is absolutely raw and not groomed well. My rating is not taking into account the noise pollution of kitty party and purely based on food, ambience and service only"
5.0,Awesome food. Paneer just melts in ur mouth. Loved everything that we ordered. Little costly place but worth the money.. best was the jalebi served with Rabdi..
4.5,Had been for lunch. Very good ambience and tasty food.over weekends this place Will be full and service is bit slow.but overall very good food and Ambience. On menu you have couple of must try food which is recommended and also you have option for  unlimited Thali option.
3.5,"They are good at ambience, plenty of space and decoration you can see there. Feels customer centric when come to the space price 3/5 food 3/5 service 3/5"
4.5,Such an awesome experience!! A sudden plan. Reservation is must on weekends.. yummiest North Indian food.. service is super.. Must visit place.. Price is little high but acceptable for such a class food ..
3.5,"We had Thali here. Food was tasty. Menu was the usual Thali items - soup, chats, kababs, kulcha, sabji, dal, Biriyani. Service was really good, the staffs were polite. Price is on a higher end for variety served. Ambience was good - interiors designed like Delhi fort. Overall a good place for full veg North Indian food."
4.5,"Excellent food, great ambience, very courteous staff. They have very different starters. liked their corn flakes based starter in particular. Can go back for sure."
4.5,"Hello, This is a place where you will find authentic north Indian food. I loved the ambience. I had ordered mozerella kulcha which were coin shaped and stuffed with yummy mouth watering cheese. The cheese balls and lassi was also very good to eat. The price is little high but yes I thoroughly enjoyed my time here."
3.5,"Delhi highway serves  a desi  indian cuisine .The restaurant is like a palace with two floors . They thalis are best preferred which serves you all categories of indian food in a small quantity.if going for alacart it's quite expensive .The food taste good .As it's a big place , not much of waiting"
3.5,"I went here with family to celebrate an occasion, on a Monday evening. Just to b sure,I made reservations,luckily d place was empty. Superb decor,special mention about how well behaved n courteous d staff was. Food was fabulous,esp Achari Paneer Tikka(we ended up re-ordering it), Karahi Veg was yummy,Dal Sunheri went perfectly with our Rice(my dad really loved d dal),Tomato Shorba was Ok,Masala Papad was fresh n tasty, Cheese Aloo Tandoori were good too. Pani Puri was presented well(almost every place does this now),it was yummy.I enjoyed d Fulka Tacos. Obviously it's an expensive place,go here if u wanna make an Occasion more special!!!"
3.0,"A deacent place for north indian vegetarian food in the middle of Indiranagar. I would have given it 3.5 if they had a restroom, unfortunately i couldnt find one here.   The rotis and rice is good, kamun is heavy. I am not a big fan of their salad though."
4.0,The good place to dine with family especially for vegetarians!!  The food is great and the service is fine and fast enough.. ambient lighting and impressive interiors.. will visiting again!!
3.0,"The place looks super expensive, but isn't a dig to your pocket. Service is okayish, food could have been better. Can definitely give a try if you are craving for some Indian food !"
3.5,"The place has good ambience. Food is not the best.. flavours were normal , what made it worse was the food we received was cold! Dissapointed overall!!"
4.5,First of all I want to clear it out that it's a pure vegetarian restaurant so all pure veggies can visit this restaurant without any hesitation.   When it comes to the location it is being placed in the one of the posh areas of Bengaluru i.e Indiranagar. Ambience wise if we look I will give it 5 star. It has one of those Arabian theme in the background which usually makes the visitors feel like a royal place.   Now we comes to Starters CHARCOAL MUSHROOM is the one everyone should try. When it comes to spicy meter it very well distributed all over with a cheese filled in between the mushrooms   Now we comes to Main course I personally ordered MUSHROOM HARA PYAZ (although I love mushrooms) it was good but It could have been better.Rumali roti is the one which everyone should try.. It's very good   The one thing which attracted me was the Pani puri. They served panipuri which different types of Water. It was something innovative and personally loved that.   When it comes to Dessert.. MOONG DAL KA HALWA is the one which made me to visit Delhi highway again.Made with a pure ghee and taste wise it was awesome 10/10..too good  and all lassi lovers can try DELHI SPECIAL LASSI it was good and it was served in desi shahi mutka that attracted me.. I would give 8/10.   So overall my experience was good.. Although it is slightly expensive but it's worth going !!
4.5,"Good food and ambience. Enjoyed the Lassi. Gol Guppa presentation is nice. Garlic naan is a hit. Service was quick and though it was busy at Sunday lunch time, we got a table as we were early."
3.0,"I was driving along 12th Main in Indiranagar to another restaurant when I happened to see this and decided to try it out for dinner. The facade looked nice and though we walked in without a reservation on a Saturday evening, got a table after a 5 minute wait.   What stands out at first glance are the prices of a few items and especially the chats that at around Rs. 250 are grossly overpriced. Still decided to order one to see what's special at this price. It took some effort to get someone to our table to take an order of the chat. The staff did not appear very organised and were not very responsive. The quantity of the chat was a little more than other places and while the taste was good, it was nothing extraordinary to justify the price.   For the mains, decided to go with Lahori Paneer, Tandoori Roti and Mirchi Paratha.  While the dish was priced pretty much in line with the rates around the area, the roti and paratha was expensive at Rs. 70 and Rs. 125 respectively.  The Lahori paneer and Mirchi paratha were good  but the roti arrived cold. Ordering a follow on roti was a major task first with finding someone to take the order and then the long wait with multiple follow ups while the paneer dish was going cold.   On the while while the food was good, the service was bad. The high prices cannot be justified."
2.5,"North Indians should avoid this place unless the nostalgia of dal makhni takes over. Still there are other places that offer it more deliciously. If you really feel like coming here, stick to the basics parantha, daals. Their starters are good, especially the dahi seekh kebab. Avoid the fusion section unless you have rolls of tissues to soak up the oil spills that accompany the dishes. The chairs, lighting is bright for senior citizens to read the menu clearly. Only a few steps to enter, did not see wheelchair access."
4.5,"Not a big veggi! But this place is simply super. Nice ambience, good service and tasty food. Rajma Chawal combo was tasty a kind of place that can be visited again just to try the various dishes on offer"
5.0,I just went today delhi highway fine dine restaurant. There is excellent service with very good ambiance even food test is very good (staffs very helpfully specially mr Dipun )who as taking care of my table i really like him service & again I will coming with my friends soon  keep maintain same quality thank you
4.5,Nice ambience with gud food.... Been here on New year day wit cousins for lunch....As it was new yr day they gav us special menu n restricted to limited items... Luv the food so much.... superb starters... Garlic naan n Romali roti r yumm.....Paneer gravy n veg kadai were yumm... Golguppa shots r superb...
4.0,"A very royal, very Dilli, and very rich spacious feel to this only veg restaurant. A new entrant in the very highly competitive Indiranagar area where there is a new place opening every month and one shutting down too every month. If one needs to survive or sustain in this dog eats dog neighbourhood one better be very good to last. Delhi Highway has lasted 6 months and have held their own very well. If they continue to do what they are good at they will surely last.  The food is rich so one needs to be a tad careful in ordering the dishes if one has gone for dinner. Ideal time for this kind of rich food is lunch time.   The ambience: spacious and well done up. 4/5 Food Quality and taste: for North Indian/mughlai food cuisine, I would say one of the best in town, if not the best. Loved their paneer.  No complaints at all with any of their starters or main course dishes. Must go back to try more of their stuff. 4.5 / 5  Quantity: quite generous, in true Dili style. 4.5/ 5 Service: no complaints but average. Maybe because the day we visited it was a busy Saturday evening. Could be better for sure. 3.5/ 5  All in all, a thumbs up."
3.5,One of the new restaurants serving indian cuisine in Indiranagar with a very mughal kind of a look in terms of ambience. Good quality and quantity of food served but a bit overpriced may be because of the prime location. I ordered for a portion of paneer lahori  and to my surprise the paneer was super soft while the naan was average  Food - 3/5 Ambience - 4/5
3.0,"Foodelicious highway style is the quote for this restaurant, enjoying the mouthwatering food amidst this setting of subtle Haveli style arch's and overhead lanterns, feels royal. Reminds us of the food served in Rajasthan, but unlike Rajasthan or the highways in Delhi, or as the restaurants claims, the feeling you get when you eat the simple dhal roti in the highways of Delhi is something we will miss here. Food is served in unique manner like Gol Gappe Shots, I could never have enough of that, the pani was perfectly blend with mint and spices, dahi bhalla papdi is also served with grated beetroot which added a raw flavour on top. The broccoli and pesto kabab's were rich in broccoli grated and neatly blending with pesto sauce, salt to balance the taste, chipotle paneer tikka and corn kebabs were equally mouthwatering. The fusion section with quesadilla Indian stuffings, the mushrooms with cheese tikka, Makhani Pasta and many more dishes makes this restaurants menu quite innovative and exactly the way this Generation's taste buds prefer. The welcome drink is another treat with a fresh fruit juice with tobasco chilli, tastes subtle n spicy at the same time. While fusion food transports you into exotic food palate, the main course was simply mediocre, the dhal lababdar, bhindi masala and shahi paneer all tasted mediocre and we're infused with butter and oil. I for one did not feel the individual gravy's taste, as to what I hoped for. Overall the restaurant tasted exotic with few and mediocre as to others, having said that. It is still a treat with the ambiance and food."
3.5,"Nicely lit, royalish feel, lively place. Decent food, standard portion (more than standard in case of gravies), slightly overpriced though. Nice staff, quite hospitable.  You need to book table in advance when you're planning to visit here, otherwise it's a long queue here specially on weekends.  Ambiance- they are 2 storied set up, on ground floor, the reception desk and couple of seats. Here is the look is more of ordinary and you might feel disappointed because of the huge entry they have. But then there are round stairs leading to first floor,  and that's where the place is known for.   Food - starters are good. Pani puri presentation is good with multi taste water, however only tangy and canberry water tastes good, rest all are complete waste. Dahi masala papdi is good. Mozeralla cheese kulcha are a must have. Rest of the things were average, average when compared to price they charged. Need improvement. Jalebi rabdi - don't try rabdi here, it taste like melted kulfi.  Service - service is nice. However staff gets confused while serving to a big group. Priyanka Jain Rahul Godha Sandeep Jain"
4.0,"On the highway to success Huge Royal feel kind of place! With the dash of gorgeous luxe decor, Dilli food the twist of veggies was delicious. The starters were served too fast but the main course took too long, so I had to cancel my other orders."
4.0,"Located in the heart of Bangalore, Indranagar.  Recently been to BLR and looking for north Indian food. My mates suggested me to go Delhi highway. And I can say that it was a wise decision.  They are good at ambience, plenty of space and decoration you can see there. Feels customer centric when come to the space utilization.  We ordered chole bhature and sarso ka saag with make ki roti. Before having an bite my finger were crossed and expecting north Indian taste and they are able to match our expectation. Delicious bhature with Chile and saag. Makki ki roti was crispy as it was mixed with flour but good in taste.  Overall good experience and recommendable..."
4.5,"This place was a pleasant surprise... not very expensive, large quantities and very tasty.  Paneer was decent but the bhindi was outstanding. Service was good. Ambience was good.  Vegetarian only and no alcohol may be something ppl don't prefer but good North Indian food definitely deserves a 4 star rating.  Adding more to this after tasting their thali. Definitely worth going back for. Fantastic pani puri, lassi and dal."
3.5,well quite a huge and royal feel kind of place! we ordered thalis and in thali grilled paneer was waste. hara bhara kebab was ok and dahi kebab was average. in main course biryani was amazing so the kesar kheer and paneer sabji as well. overall ok place for pure vegetarian and 1st timers but not going back :)
4.5,"Visited it last night for a frns Bday party! Excellent place , had nice ambience , courteous staff, food was awesome had naramdil kababs, sher mal roti ( their signature ) etc...!! yummy altogether. Nice place n icing on the cake its fully VEG!"
4.5,"This is an excellent place for vegetarian food.  We tried paneer paratha, cheesy aloo, one mushroom starter, baby tandoori kulchas, jalebi-rabdi  etc. Everything tasted great. The decor of the place is also very regal and well done.  Totally found nothing to complain about, worth another visit for sure!"
5.0,"I am a non vegetarian and I never felt vegetarian food can be this delicious. I went out with my peers to this place for my birthday treat, we settled to have the thali. The starters were really good and the paneer was so soft and all the vegetables in the starters and the food was fresh. The taste of each dish was exquisite, I really enjoyed the meal and must visit place for veg lovers"
4.5,Visited this place on a Tuesday evening for dinner with close friends. This place is located on 12th main Indiranagar inbetween mother cluckers and hangover. We started off with dhai sheekh Kababs which was very different and awesome. The malai kofta was great too. The staff were very courteous and responsive the ambience is awesome too. Over all the food and the feel was great and hence would definitely visit this place again.
3.0,"A refreshing ambience... Spacious and royal. However the food is very disappointing. The starters, the desert lack the fine balance of good Indian cuisine. The service could also use a touch of improvement. Over all not a great experience but a one time try."
5.0,A really delightful restaurant serving some of the most delicious food. It is fully vegetarian place and has a diverse array of foods. We originally wanted to go for ala carte but settled for thali. The thali was really great and we enjoyed it.
4.0,Loved the food... their sarson ka saag with Makki roti totally satiated our craving for hearty Punjabi food.. their vegetable sizzler also was good. The pav baaji was pretty average though and can be skipped surely. The staff were courteous and service was timely. The decor was nice too.
3.5,Ambiance 4.5 Service 4 Price 4 Taste 3.5  Walked into this restaurant with my family on my parents anniversary!!  The welcome and the service is too good!!  The starters were served too fast and tasted pretty good! Main course took too long!! And tasted average!!
2.0,"Been here twice! Ambience is really good.On our first  visit  we ordered thaali most of the items were good .Though felt price was more. Again visited  yesterday ,we were quite early around 7pm. Luckily only one table was free rest were booked in advance. We ordered Masala papad , Veg Seekh Kabab, which was spicy and average , Roti , Kulcha and Panneer gravy made out of tomatoes and onions which was tasteless. Ordered Dum biryani which was very very spicy , couldn't even complete quarter of the bowl!!!! Very very disappointed! Totally not worth the price. Will never visit again!!"
4.5,"Amazing food and great interior decor! We ordered the thali on a weekday and the following were the highlights-  Price - they have an unlimited thali for 499 which is just amazing!  Dishes- must try is their paneer, chaats, jilebi and rabdi!  Their customer service was extremely good, they were very nice and brought in extra sweets from the thali for my mom who wasn't doing a thali."
4.0,"Have to begin by complimenting the good work on the interiors at this place. Looks like they've spent quite a bit to deck it up and make it look rich and grandeur. With the high rents in the location it'll be interesting to see how long they'll survive here! Been here a few times, and it's always a good experience. Food is 4/5, not something incredible but pretty nice. Service was good but highest marks for ambiance. Must try the chole bathura, it was very good. Overall a good place to visit 1-2 times, nothing amazing that keeps you coming back."
5.0,"True Delhi food with a dash of gorgeous luxe decor.  Yes, everyone notices the gorgeous interiors of this place from outside. When I went inside, it felt nothing other than a luxury. From the flooring to walling to chair upholstery, it was all regal. I am not much of an ambiance person, but this place took me in an awe.  We had gone there for dinner. I tried their Achari Paneer starter. The paneer is the best you can get in Bangalore. It was soft, spongy, and slightly creamy. I think it matched the standards of Delhi paneer. Then we ordered a paneerparantha and aloo parantha. Both of them were made in proper Delhi style, though I felt the filling could have been slightly more. Special mention to the filling of the alooparantha; generally potato fillings in breads tend to have a slight irritating texture but this one was smooth and easy. It actually showed the high quality of ingredients this place used. They also served dal makhni,raita, and chole with it. Raita was really good and the dahi wasn't sour and was perfectly cold. Their chole were slightly dry to my taste (they were without gravy) but the balance of flavors was great. A big standing ovation to their Dal Makhni. It was the best Dal Makhani I have ever had. It was creamy and had this thick, rich texture. I think they just nailed it. The service of this place is great.  Overall, I am waiting to revisit this place again."
4.5,"Authentic north Indian food .Paneer tikka was awesome .Parathas were served with dal makhan,raita and chhole.Even pickles were too good.Decent price ,good family setting."
3.5,"A one time visit. My review goes as below:  Location: Very accessible & identifiable location in midst of the most happening place of Bangalore i.e. Indiranagar.  Food: A traditional with modern plating giving a fusion based look. We have Tomator Shorba which was more like your home made rasam, but tasted good. Then we had 'Dahi Sheek Kabab' which was good & also the 'Gol Gappa' which was a fusion inform of a shots, the meeta & khatta were good, but don't try with the mango & cranberry juice. In the main course we tried Channa Bhature which was not authentic & bad. & Gali Parathe Waali Combo which was good. Then we moved on to Birani & chose Hyderabadi Biryani which was good.  Beverages: We tried Seventh Heaven alone, which was good.  Ambiance: The traditional mohalla types with a modern twist which was attractive & good.  Music: Might not be playing or was not audible  Reservation: I was a walk-in, but they were a little adamant to share a suitable seating.  Service: A little slow, we had to keep asking for water, the accompaniments katoris, spoons, forks, salads & more.  An overall good visit & will it bring me back, not sure."
1.5,"I saw this place couple of time. But last weekend I planned for this place. On Sunday evening I had to wait for an hour to get the table. It food started with some sides like Chatni and amla. It just reminded me my home. Amla's were delicious in taste. Then we ordered Tomato basil shorba and cream of tomato soups. Both of them were ok. They provided only two table cloth and when we asked they told that it's over. I understand that it can happen with that much rush. Then we order their ""must to try"" paneer lababdar and dal Delhi highway. Taste were quite flat. Whole service was slow and this is something you guys need to work on. Overall experience is far below expectation."
3.5,"Went here in a Sunday afternoon for lunch with family. The place was full and we had to wait for almost 35-40 mins. After which we finally got a table for 8. It's almost rare for a pure vegetarian hotel to be this full so I was pretty impressed.  Ambience:  It's open and airy at the entrance. As you enter there's seating in front of you and two staircases on either side that lead to the top. Everything adds a very darbar feeling to the place. The interior makes you feel like you're at one of the old palaces. The crowd talking and food coming from literally everywhere was a feeling from a movie.   Food: They have a decent variety of food items. They have a special thaali that literally is the Thaali with the biggest variety of items I've come across. They started with a Pudina drink and then served the tomato Basil soup. The soup was spicy but kinda had a kick to it. Then they constantly kept serving starters. All of which were pretty good. The thaali is too filling for one person to finish. We also happened to order the Gol guppa  which they served with a variety of drinks to have with, like a cranberry juice, orange juice and the usual meetha and theekha paani. The Biryani was average.   Service :  The staff here are really nice. The service time was a tad bit slow but I think they're doing a great job. PS: they have valet. Yay.   The Thaali on a weekend costs up to 780 bucks and it was slightly on the more expensive side but definitely worth a shot."
4.0,"We loved the place. Food was brilliant especially the paneer tikka. The outside of the restaurant makes you feel that its a premium reataurant which it is except the prices are very reasonable considering the food portions. Though, would urge the management to better educate the waiters and serving staff with more professionalism so that the overall experience is enhanced. Though, overall a great place. Cheers!"
4.0,"This place is located just a little ahead of Hangover in Indiranagar.  This is one place which you would never miss when you pass by it. It's got a majestic entrance with big glass walls and it simply looks royal due to the infused mughlai durbaari touch.  There are two levels of seating and I would suggest to take the one above. The decor is very neat. I liked the entire ceiling work and that royal touch which takes you back to the Mughal ages.  Coming to food, well the food was indeed excellent. The starters were good and you must not miss out on the veg platter as well as their tikkas. It's simply delicious.  In the main course we had ordered 3 curries and all of them were extremely well prepared and delicious. The quantity was good and we ate to our heart's content. The service was also quite prompt.  The Desserts can be given a miss as there's nothing very extraordinary or something that you can't have outside.  I will definitely visit this place again and would recommend everyone to visit the place as well."
4.5,"It's a tough decision to have an all Veg Restaurant in Bangalore , have been here thrice and they delight me Everytime. Extra soft Paneer!!! Do order the Dal Makhani and Garlic Naan.   May look a bit expensive at first but the quantity and hospitality makes up for it."
1.0,"The word is pathetic. To start of with food. Horrible is an understatement. The biggest problem is the service. Very slow. When we were asked to give review, we honestly said that the food isn't good and service is too slow. The waiter was furious and he thew the bill on our table and said these words "" you are not a guest. You get lost"". The worst experience ever.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."
3.0,"Firstly Delhihighway has a Great ambience and secondly service is good. Food should get better in taste to match its cost,ambience and service."
3.5,"Visited the place for office lunch, they did take quite sometime however the food was good considering it being a vegetarian place.  The interiors are nicely done. One time visit restaurant."
4.0,"It was tough to decide between a 3.5 and 4 for this place, but the ambience and their signature dal tips the scale in their favour. While you walk in, you almost feel as though you are in some palace in Rajasthan! The restaurant is done up pretty well, beautiful white walls with dim yellow lights. Speaking of the food, being a place that claims to serve Delhi food, the paneer platter was a must order and it did not disappoint. The tamatar shorba could have had more flavour but that wasn't a downer as well. For main course we ordered their signature dal-loved loved loved. Also one mixed vegetable with assorted bread. It was all delicious. Will definitely go back to try out more dishes, but from what I've had so far, for Indian cuisine lovers, this is a must visit place. FYI-they also serve chaat!"
3.5,"The food is a bit expensive for a vegetarian fare. I didn't know it was  pure vegetarian food. I got to know that after seeing the menu. I ordered 2 appetisers and what I had was good though, however I don't think it's worth the price. 850 rs. For veg starters!!! I just had the starters and then went to some other restaurant to have the main course."
1.5,"Pathetic service and arrogant staff, the manager(Charles) doesn't even know how to talk to customers. Food is also average. Waste of time and money. wont recommend. A mood spoiler it was."
3.5,"The Find: Hunt for North Indian food.   The Ambience: Grandeur. Very exquisite and fine. We had opted for take away but it would have been wonderful to sit and have food there. They had beautifully carved walls with small gates engraved on them, a nice ceiling and finely laid tables.  The Food: Dal Delhi Highway: It had such a tempting description in menu that i had high hopes but it turned out to be a pretty ordinary. It was decent but the richness and the aroma of ghee/butter was missing.  Paneer Lababdar: This was a disappointment. The salt content was high, ruining the taste. Paneer lababdar is supposed to have a rich creamy tomato gravy, the restaurant clearly didn't do justice to the dish.  Kulchas & Tandoori Rotis: These were good. Kulchas very soft and great.   Service: Very kind and welcoming.  Overall Experience: Good eat once in a while but heavy on pocket. The meal for two cost 1200/- and for average eat the cost is not justifiable."
4.5,I went to there for lunch.  The food is really good and worth the price.  The ambience is also very good.  The service provided was excellent.   We ordered Thali there which was very filling and perfect for its cost.
4.5,Food was absolutely on point and portions were massive. A starter a dal and a roti more than enough for two. Fab service as well. Well worth it!
4.5,"Centrally located at the 12th main road on indranagar bangalore , a majestic entrance welcome you with complete beige shade showing the royalness of the ambience.Floored with Italian marble and wooden decor around the walls makes the ambience a must visit place. Started with the Hara Bhara kabab and Naram dil Kabab added with papad churi ,the starters were perfect for the beginning of a well spent evening.                                                                 ...Read full post on secondhandbmw.wordpress.com"
5.0,"One of my new favorite places in the newer bunch of restaurants. This place is just about a year old.  Service is fantastic. Extremely efficient despite the crowd.  Tried the Assorted Tandoori Fresh Farm starter. Had an entire Broccoli and some amazingly seasoned fresh vegetables.  The Malai Kofta was one of the best I've had so far in the city. The restaurant is a bit pricey but I liked the entire experience. For once, we had a table where both the distance from the table and height of the chair as compared to the table was perfect.  Would recommend this place for sure.   Note: Please mention your spice levels well in advance to these guys when you're ordering. I had to return at least 2 - 3 dishes and ask them to make it milder for me. It was really hard on the palette"
3.0,This place delivers food to my company cafeteria in the form of box meals.  The cost or taste is not as expected or upto the mark. People urge for better improvement and hence a very brief review to have them deliver good quality and tasty food!                                                                 noorinfoodistan.wordpress.com
1.0,"Horrible service.  This place is only charging for their ambience. Once you order anything it takes ages for the order to reach the table. The waiters and managers are mostly clueless. Moreover,  the food taste is not worth the price."
4.0,Prices are on the higher side but the taste is phenomenal!!..making this a must visit for veggies. Dal makhni is a def worth it. Suitable for family gatherings. Ambience is classy.Worth visiting for sure.
4.5,"Could very well satiate my long-drawn craving for proper dilli food, with added benefits of a great ambience and warm, personalised service. A must-visit for all north-indian cuisine, fine dining lovers. The decor is inspired from the royal mughal era. Food - every item that we ordered was a delight for the palate and to the eyes - from pav bhaji to matar kulcha, chhole bhature and pani poori, rich gravies and soft naans in main course, and shahi tukda and kulfis in desserts. We liked it so well that we wanted to revisit the place the very next day. An assured yum-treat for the vegetarians"
1.0,Horrible food and over charged for the quantity supplied. Ambience is good and nothing beyond it. Be Careful while giving vehicle for parking.
3.5,With so baby places to eat North Indian food in Indira Nagar... Delhi highway was our spot this time... might I say the place was packed...you need reservations if you don't want to wait on weekends !!! Decor is good !!!  On the other hand food is quite a disappointment!! We tried all different things like pasta with a twist...we did not like it...the standard dishes were good.. Food - 3.5 Service - 3.5 Ambience- 3.5 Value for money - 3
4.5,"When you enter into Delhi Highway it gives you feel of north India... Pretty nice ambience , service and food was nice. I felt some items were overpriced but taste was good."
3.5,"Visited the place a few weeks back. We were looking for a lunch option and decided impulsively to stop here.  First reaction on decor was TACKY. No real theme I could relate to between decor and furniture.  We ordered the specials instead of thali or a la carte. The choke bhature, matar kulcha and paratha chole.  Surprise surprise the food had good taste. Esp the chole having the ajwain tadka did give it a good twist.  Slightly heavy and oily and heavy for my pallete but it still worked.  I thought the thali was a bit over priced.  Definitely a return visit will happen by me here just for food  DOWN SIDE. THEY INCLUDE 10% SERVICE CHARGE IN YOUR BILL. WHICH MEANS YOU ARE TIPPING THEM COR SERVICE WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT!!!"
4.0,"If you want some delicious Delhi food,  this is the place for you but meat lovers stay away. Delhi highway serves some really yummy typical Delhi vegetarian food. Staff service is really decent. Prices are a bit expensive but the ambience just wins over everything. Definitely worth trying."
3.5,This restaurant has an magnificent ambience. However food is not upto the level expected to put up with its ambience. Quality wise food is good.. seems fresh and tastes good. Quantity is small portions not worth paying the huge amount the charge. Staff are friendly.
1.5,"A magnificent palace-like decor and ambience is all that this place has to offer. The food is pathetic. No taste. Definitely not Delhi food! The dahi ke seekh kababs were extremely salty and nothing else. Pani puri, below average. Mix veg kulcha was OK, butter paneer, well, we've had better ones!"
4.0,"Went there for a friend's birthday who loves vegetarian food.  Was pretty full for a weekday dinner,  we managed to get seats for our group and ordered for Dahi seekh Kabab, Tandoori Chipotle mushroom and lahori Kabab. All of them tasted so good,  a special mention for the mushrooms.  For main course we had ordered sunahari dal, paneer Delhi style and Diwani handi. The dal and the paneer tasted like authentic Northindian food and brilliant. Among the breads, veg kulcha was brilliant.  The ambience was very good,  with nice decor giving a royal feel and very prompt service and friendly staff @DelhiHighway"
3.5,"It is situated in an area which is quite popular for pubs and cafes so a fully vegan restaurant came as a surprise. I expected it to have a dhaba theme but had royal mughal architecture.  I would give full marks for the ambiance it has to offer. Food on offering is not the best of what i have experienced in Bangalore. Ordered Paneer lahori which was delicious, Malai kofta was pretty bad. I liked the lassi served in ""Kulhad"".  The service is not the quickest and prices are a little bit on the higher side."
3.0,Ambiance is too good and impressive.  You get a grand feeling when you enter this place.  Food on the other side was average.  The soup served was cold.  Had to send it back.  The starting was a big let down.  The tandoori baby kulcha was good but could be better if served with something on the side rather than chutney.  Tried a few more snack item.  It was average according to a fine dining standard. May be will give there North Indian a try.  Service was good.
2.0,"Really impressive ambience ... ordered the unlimited veg thali .. We got  welcome drinks , dahi puri chaat , pani puri .. followed by Corn Palak soup .. and panner and few other starters .. all of which were pretty good ... For the main course we were given paneer butter masala , palak veg , daal , mix veg along with roti and firni lassi and Kheer for desserts ... The paneer butter masala had the exact same taste as the ones we get at mast kalandar .. the biryani literally had no taste and when it was brought to the notice of the management they just said no one eats spicy food .. The food was literally bland .. I believe the ala carte is much better here .. the buffet is a big no-no unless they revamp their offerings .."
4.0,This place looks absolutely amazing from the outside. The interiors are ok compared to the entrance. Seating is not very comfortable but better than a dhaba. The food is good decent variety and portions. Must try place.
1.0,Food is OK.I am very disappointed with staff less staff members compared to size and crowd in the restaurant.Food came late have to wait long time for order to arrive.  If there is option for minus rating.I will probably go for it.
4.0,"""No matter how much you have, it's not enough""... This is a new restaurant which has probably out beaten many older ones in the category, here's why: 1) Absolutely stunning and beautiful appearance - interior and exterior! A ""Darbaar"" feeling.. 2) No doubt about the quality and finesse of food.. Must try - Daal makhani (also served with any paratha combo) They have a range of Chaats as well and also few continental dishes in Indian style - I tried ""Makhni Pasta"" which was great indeed. 3) Service was pretty decent and the place was crowded.. not very pricy..  Great start but to keep it going, the food quality needs to be maintained!  Best Wishes, Swati 3)"
1.0,Service was horrible. We had to recite the order twice as the server forgot my order. Ambience was terrible with service personnel putting down silverware multiple times on the floor. The person who took the order should be sent to saravaana bhavan or some place like that as he has no knowledge on the menu. And finally the food taste and quality was awful. We ordered jeera rice and we got it where the jeera is fully burnt. Terrible experience. Will never go again..nor recommend.
1.0,"Absolutely rude treatment at Delhi Highway. They refused to take my reservation stating I would get a table at 9.45 pm. I showed up with my guest and was treated poorly, with the gentleman at the front saying ""It's not our problem you did not reserve.""   I guess they'll never get my business."
5.0,Awesome food... nice ambience... a must try! Restaurant  people are polite. Loved the way they present the food. Not too expensive. Well maintained. Kudos!
3.5,"Standing tall opposite to Phobidden Fruit, this place looks very royal!  Ambiance: Grand stairs on both the sides with a very mughal architecture and nicely worked walls. Don't go by the name because this is very far from Delhi's highway dhabas. Seating space is spread across two floors with comfy chairs and couches. An ideal place for a family dinner.  Food: The dahi kebabs are absolutely a delicious start to your meal. Tastes best with green chutney. Slight crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, made out of hung curd. The garlic naan tastes very tasty! The malai kofta has a bright yellow thick curry, and has a very rich taste and is not very spicy. The Shahid Tukda is served in a sweet ras-malai kind gravy. The perfect Diwali dessert.  Adding from my second visit, the panipuri looks really good. 6 shots of different types of water topped with golgappe.  Service: The staff is very polite and quick. The prices are a little bit on the higher side but the food and ambiance make up for it. Another visit? For a fancy veg dinner, yes!"
2.0,"The place seems to be extremely overrated. The tamatar dhaniya shorba and paneer based starters were just ok and virgin mojito was horrible, perhaps it's the only place that makes mojito with water instead fizzy sprite. The tasty dal makhni helped it secure a rating of 2"
4.0,"We were here last evening,everyone really enjoyed food and service.very few restaurants are vegetarians  in bangalore so keep it up .see you'll soon . thanks"
3.0,"A newly opened one (have been seeing it since its construction stage)! Thought of treating my tastebuds with a bit of Delhi delight.  Well.. being honest... The ambience and the location is just perfect.. The idea of recreating the Delhi Durbar kind of ambience was a great idea matching to the title (and one pull factor for the restaurant)  The service was just average. Nothing much to comment on. They were cold and just normal way of dealing people.  The main part... the food.. probably for me it was not tasting so great, just the normal biriyani that we could eat from anywhere outside. The soup that we had, shorba was still better and piping hot.  In short... i would recommend foodies not to go with a high zeal and expectation, so that you dont get disappointed. Like me..  Anish Nair  BR"
4.0,"Landed here for dinner and was very impressed with how grand the decor of the place is. Honestly, when I heard of this place the first thing which came to my mind was yet another old highway dhaba themed restaurant serving buttery food but was proved wrong. The management has taken care that the ambiance is neither to overwhelming neither too basic. In short, the place has a very delicate and classy ambiance.  Coming to the food we started of with charcoal paneer. One of the specials of the place and honestly was blown away. Soft mushroom stuffed with paneer and spiced to perfection and grilled just right. Easily one of the best mushroom dishes I have had.  For the main course we had the paneer lahsooni and butter nan. The paneer lahsooni was really flavourful and spiced to the limit. If you don't like too much spice in your food then you might not like it but for the rest it's just a big party on your taste buds.  We also ordered for some lemon ice tea which was pretty refreshing. All in all a good place for some great food. Only con would be that though the service is attentive it can be a bit more prompt.Cheers!!"
4.0,"Place stands out for the way they have designed the entire thing. So, appearance wise it's a straight hit. If you love the North Indian cuisine, it's definitely worth a shot. Service is good, taste and served amount is also good. The prices are on a higher side but for the experience you get out of it, it's not a bad deal."
3.0,"I wonder why so many thali places just becomes a one-time thing. Anyway, the service is slow so be patient. Food is not all that great but its enough to please you otherwise.   Overall, go there once, admire the decor and once you've finished your meal, don't look back."
4.0,"Ambience is great lyk royal palace. Dahi Kebab although not great. They served complimentary drink ""Lassi"" very yummy. But Main course also would have been upto d mark if breads served hot n covered. Overall nyc place to dine out."
3.5,"Nice taste, Huge quantity in serving main course, but pretty Bad service. This is a pure veg place, with decent taste of north indian food being served. There is always waiting list here, so be prepared."
3.0,"Vegetarian north Indian, difficult to find a good one in blr. N sadly this too is not really great. The mushrooms as starters were decent but the signature dal was OK but wouldn't go back for it."
3.5,"A complete vegetarian restaurant which was the surprise as most of the North Indian restaurant also have Non-veg menu as well except few places where we have Thali options like Rajdhani, NH-8. Food was good - 3.5, service is okay - 3 , little expensive -3.5. They have Jain menu as well, good place to go with family."
4.5,"A complete vegetarian place, probably a delight for the vegetarians where they need not worry about what is coming on the plate. I am a non vegetarian and went to the place as a part of office team lunch. The place is decorated well and has a north indian look to it. The food was delicious and I did not miss non vegetarian dishes. I liked the diwani handi along with the roti and the veg pulao. The paneer dishes were nice. The service can be faster. The menu can be tweaked to include an assorted roti basket.  Update:  Second visit.  Had the thali this time and it was yummy. I enjoyed everything on the plate. Of all the vegetarian places I had the misfortune of going (being pure non vegetarian) I actually enjoyed it and dont consider it to be an unfortunate excursion."
2.5,The food quality was insipid.  The service was slow. The only saving grace was the ambience which gave you a feel of grand Delhi atmosphere.
4.5,"Went to this place with family for lunch after a long time,as it was a holiday on 11.10,we had to wait for quite some time.Beautiful ambiance with wonderful food,Naram Dil Kabab is a must try but the only complaint i have is on the service,it's pathetically slow and chaotic,we had to 30 min after we finished the starters,even though the main course was ordered at the same time.If they pick it up on service part,they can easily be in top 3."
4.0,"The search for vegetarian food can sometimes could be quite challenging.  And then you sometimes wonder if there would be something interesting in a given area.  Then you also start to wonder if they would be combination of Veg and Non-Veg or purely Veg.  Later, you start to wonder how would the ambiance of the place be and the of course the pricing.  Well, this is exactly what I had thought in my mind before coming across Delhi Highway.  I think all the question I had in my mind seem to have been answered this restaurant which is located in the heart of Indranagar.  An area which is quite popular for pubs, cafes and restaurants.  I got an opportunity to taste the food that is served at the restaurant and must say that I was quite amazed with the quality.  And there surely was no doubt about the variety as well.  Let me share my experience.  Ambiance  The name might suggest that it is a dhaba kind of restaurant.  But then when you look at the entrance and the interiors, you will be simply amazed.    Entrance is a huge place which resembles the entrance of a palace.  It might be hard to believe, it actually is.  The seats inside give a feeling like you are sitting in some historic palace with those wonderful chairs.  There is an antique sofa and chair at the entrance which looks cool.  Infact, everyone would like take a picture or selfie sitting on it.  Chandelier can see at the entrance hallway.  And there is some wonderful artwork around the same.  The seats are well spread out and it lets you relax and move around.  Seats on the first floor look all the more special and give a feeling like you are getting inside Deewane Khaas (English  Entry for special guests).  I surely cant share more info in words.  But yes, the place surely is special.  Location  Let me start to give directions from Domlur flyover heading towards the Old Airport Road.  Drive along until you find the Sony Signal.  That would be the cross-over for 12th main on Indranagar.  Take left turn there and drive along.  Delhi Highway appears to the right side.  There is no chance to the miss the place as it has got a grand entrance.  Food  The place is known very much for the buffet option which has plenty of items that are served.  Let me share my experience on the food I had along with my other foodie friends.  There are quite a few items that I tried and its rightful for me to actually list them out and share my thoughts on the same.  Tomato Dhaniya Shorba  IT surely is one of the best soup that I have had in a long and it tasted yummy.  The presentation was also quite wonderful and I very much enjoyed it.  Chaat  There were 2 chats that were served which included  Dahi Paapdi Chaat and Gol Gappe.    Gol Gappe was served in the cutest manner possible where in the puri was loaded with stuffing.  And the puri was kept on a small glass that had pani.  The idea was to pour the pani into the puri with stuffing and eat them off.  Dahi Paapdi Chaat was another starter that was served quite well. There were cut vegetable pieces on top of the chaat, also methi chutney and curds were added.  Taste of the chaat was quite good.  The best part was also that it is served in smaller portion which lets you enjoy the dish and may be ask for additional if needed.  Masala Paapad  A special papad that had rolled masala papad and stuffing inside it.  It was well place inside a small glass to be able to pick up and eat.  Starters  There are plenty of starter options here.	  Pesto Paneer Tikka  I must say that it was super yummy and for sure the combination of Paneer and pesto did wonders.  I think it surely is one of the best tikka I have eaten in a while.  Veg Sheek Kebab  Another wonderful dish which surely cant be explained in words.  It was presented in such a lovely manner that you would immediately want to gulp 1-2 of them.  It is must try at this place.  Lahori Kebab  A dish that surely reminds you for the kebab that you get in Punjab region.  An item that seems to have been prepared by someone who is seasoned.  Navram DIl Kebab Starter that for sure makes your happy when you take it.    Main Course  There are plenty of options that again served in a thali.  But you can always ask for more portions of the dishes that are there.  Some of the items that are served as thali includes  Paneer Lababdaar, Dal Delhi Highway, Diwani Handi, Bhindi Masala and Jeera Aloo Masala.  Each and every dish had great taste which would just transport you to different world.    I enjoyed the flavour of each and every dish along with the breads.  They served the Tandoori Roti/Naan which were quite soft and tasted good without the curries.  Rice  Hyderabadi Biryani was served which I thought was the weakest link. The masala was pretty good but yes it could have been better.    Deserts  Jelabi & Rabadi  This is a sweet that is known to one and all.  Rabdi is something that is made of milk extracts.  The taste was simply awesome. To add to the flavours, saffron is also added on top of it.  There were other options as well which included  Kesariya Kheer and Moongdal Halwa.  Drinks  Delhi Special Lassi  A well-made Lassi can easily sooth you and make you feel a lot relaxed.  It can act as a good lubricant while eating food as well.  The taste was pretty decent, maybe it did not have much of the churn.  But the idea of serving on Khullad was pretty good.  Overall Experience  I very much enjoyed having food at this restaurant and felt happy that after a long time there is Vegetarian North Indian restaurant.  It surely will be liked by many folks in the locality and I would recommend this place to one & all.  The ambiance is something that will be liked and service for sure is pretty good.  I hope the same consistency is maintained during my future visits.  M current rating for this place is 4.0/5. But it surely is very close to be rated higher.    My rating in other departments.  Food  4.0/5  Service  4.0/5  Ambiance  4.25/5  Drinks  4.0/5  Food for 2 considering will come up to anywhere between INR 1000-1500 which is quite effective price wise for the experience.                                             fodyssey.com"
1.0,"On a Wednesday evening, unhoped for and uncommonly, there is no one at the reception to verify my reservation, I was all over the place in search for someone to assist me, finally when I do find him, appallingly(surprisingly) and unexpectedly it is revealed to me that there is no reservation.  Not only is there a extensive wait but also the wait seems to never cease to come to an end.  Moving on to the food:  I. Appetisers a. Paneer Tikka - Average  b. Naram dil kebab - Average  II. Main course a. Paneer paratha - below average b. Black dal - poor, very poor (not close to any black dal that I have ever tried also that there was poor use of ingredients, less salt)  c. Diwani handi (green) - average  Design is brilliant. Ambience - Noisy as well as there are waiters running around causing nuisance, which is quite irritating.   Manager does not have any decency or courtesy to respond to their foodies as well as the waiters who are always in a hassle don't take the orders completely and rush us while we are ordering.  I would personally not recommend this restaurant because instead of having a delightful evening, it would lead to you having a unpleasant experience."

1.0,Worst restaurant ever visited first of all they gave the table after 1 hour of the booked time and then ordered the kabab platter for starter where they  never mentioned that mashroms will be served there it was written only paneer and kababs. which was also undercooked and was served in hurry  because lots of people wait down for there turns and then we order Dal makahni and Mali kofta which  was not so bad but we order mix stuff kulcha and was served with matar stuff kulcha and when I confronted with the manager he just said sorry and reversed the charges and  then he offered me to send the kulcha again for which I said No because by then the mood was completely off and it was completely waste of time be aware before you go there on busy days
3.0,We went there on monday Evening....First of all table Reservation is highly recommended... About food... Mojito's were awesome... starters were good and main course were ok...ok... One staff member is very arrogant... I think he is cashier ... Over all ok...ok experience... Ambience is gud
2.5,"The staff who attends to calls are the worst i hv seen by far ! Kept trying to reach them n none responded ! Next day they picked the call and while i am speaking they pass the phone to their colleagues without even informing ...The last person Charles so called Manager was so arrogant that he is not bothered to listen and says this - what do you want tel me now !! I if you want a reservation i dont have till 10 pm ! So rude !  Coming to the food its average, service is very bad and ambience is good !  While inwas dining there i could only hear fellow customers from all tables on my left and right jus so frustrated with the service that everyone has only one thing to say - call yoir manager n the manager turns out to be Charles the worst of the lot ! Others are atleast smiling n ready to listen...bad experience"
5.0,"Awesome place with great north indian food. The thali is grand and would require quite an appetite to finish. The plating is awesome and every dish served is full of flavour. Be it the pani puri, chats, tikkis, or the soup. The tikkis n kebabs were great. Coming to main thali all the dishes were prepared to perfection and had the authentic north indian taste. My taste buds were craving for more n more of the kheer and halwa. Hospitality is good.Better to book the place in advance as it gets crowded over the weekend."
4.0,new place and staff are very enthuastic. goid choice for a veg north indian meal. desert are execllent (try the fig halwa). would loke to visit with family
1.0,"1. Worst service and time management. 2. Kept us waiting even tough seats were available. 3. Staff are very less in number. 4 coming to food we ordered mix tikka, which was ultimately horrible. 5. Followed up by dal makhani, pindi chole and tandoori roti which was below avg."
2.0,A huge disappointment in terms of overall service... food was good but we had to wait for approx. 45 min each between ordering the food to starters and from starters to main course... very slow customer response and moreover their card swiping machine was also not functional... not expected this from delhi highway.. so to summarize:  Ambience: good Staff and service: very slow and poor Food: good Overall will not visit again... not value for money...
1.0,"Glorified fine dining, such a disappointment. We had to wait for 20 minutes for chaat to get servered after 15 minutes of waiting when tables were seen empty. We ordered Bombay Ragda patties and was most horrible experience to our tastebuds. No Aroma, no taste at all. The patties was served cold and stuffed with bread that was not even cooked / fried well. The presentation of dish was bad and no chutneys were served as part of the dish. Chef must go and eat Ragda Patties in Mumbai. Being a Mumbaikar and grown up with Ragda Patties this dish for me was a clear disappointment. We returned the dish after eating a spoonful.  We gathered courage and ordered veg kadai with wheat roties. This too seem like a mixure of chopped carrots, peas and beans with some gravy with few strands of onions. Rather than cooking this appeared to be a quick mix of boiled veggies with readymade multipurpose gravy. The wheat roties were too not hot but just about warm.  Althoygh the ambiance and decor is lavish and staff is totally confused and lacked order. When i refused to pay service charges due to bad service there was an argument. I was told that this is fine dining and service charges are to ve paid. I showed them their menu to point out there is no mention of compulsory service charge and I am in my rights for not paying for something I had a bad experience. Their systems dont print any bill without service charge thus they took my payment without service charge but gave me a bill mentioning service charge.  A never to return restaurant for sure. My advise don't waste your money on this joint. Oh, I forget to tell this is a pure veg restaurant, and the delhi name is not to be fooled with any non veg delicacies delhi is known for...there is no sign outside that states this is pure veg..."
4.0,"Good place, tastefully done and definitely comes close to authentic North Indian food.   Must have : dahi kebab and stuffed mushrooms.   Disclaimer: it's a pure vegetarian place"
2.5,"Unhappy with the place. The staff here lacks brains and doesn't have any logic. They book places on basis of number of days. And that place is not given to anyone. We reached there at 8 and we asked them to give us a table on the first floor , which was reserved for 9 or 10 people, who were going to arrive at 9 or so. They gave us various stupid reasons to not give us the place that we wanted. Sanitation and service is poor. Food in terms of quality is too good but the quantity holds back the attraction due the price of each dish. Wouldn't recommend people to visit here on a weekend."
3.5,Ambience is veryy good. Pure veg restaurant. Ordered one starter malai kabab and paneer Delhi style. Taste was also good but still felt it was overpriced. Been to tandoori taal also in same area that has exactly same dishes n taste and lesser price.
4.0,"Easily located .  The ambience is so beautiful . Outstanding ambience .  Generous staff.  Loved the way they presented the buffet menu.  The food is good. Starters were great .

4.5,"Delhi Highway is the latest entrant to the Indira Nagar, 12th Main area which already boasts of a sea of popular cafes, bistros, pubs of Bangalore. Its a fine dinepure vegetarian restaurant offering both ala carte as well as unlimited thali options.

I wouldn't have complained if they had stated clearly outside that this is a PURE VEG restaurant. This is where my review ends.... No way I am going to waste my time reviewing a veg restqurant"
4.5,"A new addition on the busy street of 12th main road in Indiranagar, we get a gem in Bangalore itself now. After successfully running in Mumbai and Chennai, Bangaloreans have just got lucky. A fine dining restaurant, with a royal Mughlai ambiance with Golden and blue interiors and brilliant hanging Chandeliers, the place stands out, totally!  You can cater your tastebuds with a great variety of Vegetarian options in the menu, be it A la Carte or Thali. The moment you enter, the aroma of the food will tempt you so badly. I was here one weekend with great friends and we opted for a Thali.  We started off with the Apple mojito as the welcome drink. Lemon and Apple with Soda topped with mint and appe cubes. A refreshing drink which tasted amazing.  Time for Soup to increase the apetite, we were served Tomato Shorba, tangy with coriander leaves, a perfect desi soup i call it.  I must tell you, the presentation of food with the creativity won my heart, I am sure you would love it too. Time for Masala Papad, a rolled papad with the filling of onion, tomatoes and coriander served in a glass. it was a cute presentation.  Hailing from Delhi, my love for chat has no boundaries. the Dahi bhalla and Gol gappe were totally outstanding. For me, it was difficult to try Golgappas anywhere as i did not liked the taste. I am glad my Golggappa cravings will be addressed now. The Golgappas are served with the spicy water in a shot glass with a Golgappa at the top. The Dahi bhalla was tangy, thick and tasted amazing.  Starters were a hatke combination of Punjabi and mexican, a combination hard to believe, but turned out to be lip smacking. We were served a huge variety of starters and i loved each and every one of them honestly. First one being the Charcoal mushroom, stuffed with chese filling ad grilled in tandoor till perfection. The taste was delectable. We then had Naram Dil k kabab along with the Dahi kabab, Basil pesto tikki, Atta tacos and Indo mexican quesedillas. The loved the Fulka tacos, the filling was great and paneer was in a great quantity,too. Quesedillas tasted perfect. I couldnt think it would turn out to be this delicious though.  After good food, we were almost full, but we still had room for min course and we didnt want to miss out on anything here.In the thali, we had curries of Paneer Delhi style, Pindi channa masala, Dal , Methi matar malai and corn palak sabzi along with hyderabadi biriyani. Among the indian breads were tandoori stuffed kulchas as well and that was one yummy thing.  Desserts delighted us with Jalebi with Rabdi which tasted superbly tasty. The rabdi here was creamy, thick and went along with the jalebis. Hot gulab jamuns were cherry on the cake literally and i couldn't stop munching. The lassi was creamy thick and above awesome.  The tummy was way more full and tastebuds satisfied to the core. The staff is well trained, it really helps and they were keen to serve and explain the dishes to us. It is truly commendable. The service was quick and that impressed us pretty much.  This is one place which made me happier than ever with the amazingly yummilicious North indian food with all options in Veg. The price wont burn a hole in your pocket. It costs 499++ on Weekdays and 650 on Weekends which is a great deal.  My weekend was made. Do try this for an amazing veg feast guys!                                             foodgasmdiaries.wordpress.com"
3.0,Nice ambience and great service :) We were seated upstairs but needed a change of table and the manager was very considerate !! Liked their paneer platter but was disappointed with tomato soup and biryani
1.0,"Horrible staff and manager! Guess,  they forget the basics of hospitality.  Recently made this mistake of trying the Delhi cuisine at the restaurant.  The food is just average but the manager has attitude way above average. They missed hospitality completely like they don't care you eat or not.  The actual Delhi Highway has better mannered and better tasting food!  Never coming back and wouldn't recommend.."
2.0,Not worth the money spend. Food quality and service needs drastic improvement.  Aloo Tikki chat was not close to what it should be. Paneer Lahori was more salty than spicy as mentioned by the server.
4.0,Beautiful building. Good ambiance. The food is good. The thali is very reasonable than la cart . Lots to eat and good taste. The service is good too.
4.5,"Delhi highway after successfully running in Chennai and Mumbai has entered namma Bengaluru and is located in the prime locality of Indiranagar. The ambiance is majestic with rich interiors giving a royal feeling.

3.5,"A fine dining vegetarian-only restaurant with North Indian cuisine. Because it's pure veg, it is only a one-time try for me and possibly many other non-vegetarians. However the quality of food is excellent. The naram dil kabab was great and the best part of the meal was the plating of the pani puri (see image). The food, however, is very overpriced for it being vegetarian."
4.0,"Good place to have proper North Indian food. The food is very delicious and is served nicely. Ambience is great with good instrumental music. If you want to have good vegetarian food, should definitely try this place. The only reason I've cut 1 rating is because of their highly overpriced rotis/naans, I mean Rs. 125+taxes for 1 Garlic Naan is too much."
3.5,"An apt fine dining restaurant for North Indian food lovers and are pure vegetarians!!!A must visit place!!  Update post second my visit:  Our first visit, we got to order their popular North Indian thali which included unlimited starters, main course and desserts which was tasty and pocket friendly too.. My second recent visit was for dinner and they don't have thali menu for the dinner. We went with Alacarte and was not too impressed with their veg kadhai which was full of carrots and no other veggies!!! This time we enjoyed only the golgappas..Also felt it was quite heavy on my pockets for the Alacarte offering!!Post my second visit I would rate this place somewhere between 3.5-4.0."
2.5,"Food was good, service was pathetic. Had to look for waiters for half of the time. Also took lot of time to prepare food. Not at all worth the money considering the other options available nearby."
4.5,"Delhi Highway is the latest entrant to the Indira Nagar 12th main road area which already boasts of a sea of popular cafes, bistros, pubs of Bangalore. Its a fine dinepure vegetarian restaurant offering both ala carte as well as unlimited thali options.   The place is spread across two floors and each floor is designed splendidly giving a royal aesthetic pleasure to the eyes. The interiors of the place present you with a fine class of decor with every minute detail been taken care to give a feeling similar to the ones of pristine imperial families of the North India. Bright colors to go with luxurious excellent wood finish seating and a beautiful chandelier at the entrance sums up the the ambiance of the place.  We also had a chance to meet the owner/founder of the Delhi Highway chain of restaurants and we came to know that this is their 11th outlet in India after successful ventures in Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi.The attire of the servers can be compared to those of the royal servants of the king.The music mainly bollywood slow numbers was easy on the ears and not high on the decibel scale. I was even humming along while finishing up my thali.  I was here along with my foodie friends and other food bloggers for a special tasting session. Our lunch session started with the drinks and soups to be followed by theyummy starters and delicious thalis to end with the desserts.  Apple Mojito : This amazing welcome drink was the perfect start to the Lunch. It was refreshing in taste with the apple and lemon infused mocktail sprinkledon the top with mint leaves. Served in conical mock tail glasses, this drink was all perfect in taste and flavors till the last drop.  Tomato dhaniya shorba : The hot,thick tomato soup was flavored with dhaniya and pepper. Very well balanced in taste.  Masala Papad : Papads made in conical shapes and filled in the inside with spicy mint chutney and finely chopped onions and tomatoes.  Dahi bhalla chat : A popular snack of North India and sweet and tangy in taste. The crispy papdis and bhalla dipped in fresh curd with dressing of green chutney, pomegranate seeds,channa dal and finely sliced beet root.  Gol gapppe : The usual pani puri or gol gappe served with a twist as the tangy mint pani was served in tequila glasses. Fillings inside puri could have been made better.   The starters served was kinda fusion of Indian and Mexican cuisine with quesedillas and tacos along with our own favorite tikkis and kebabs.  Charcoal Mushroom : Marinated button mushrooms,stuffed with cottage cheese and grilled over charcoal in a tandoor.  Naram Dil kebab : The most popular one among the starters and my personal favorite. Fine cottage cheese balls coated with corn flakes from outside and deep fried to make it crispy yet so soft from the inside that it melts with the first bite in mouth. Served with white sauce kinda dip.  Dahi seekh kebab : Another excellent appetizer from the royal houses. Deep fried seekhs made in rhombical figures made from the mixture of cottage cheese, boiled potatoes,spinach and mixed with curd and garnished with mint,dhaniya leaves. Excellent preparation with delectable taste.  Brocolli and pesto tikki : Tikkis made from finely mixed veggies and broccoli.   Whole wheat fulka tacos : Wheat tacos filled with tomato salsa, kidney beans, cottage cheese, guacomole and topped with finely grated cheese and parsley. Served with mayoand guacomole as dips. The mexican fusion went well with the Indian appetizers.  Indo Mexican Quesedillas : Served with 3 types of dips, another appetizing dish from the Indo-Mexican fusion cuisine.  After filling up my tummy with all those tantalizing starters, I asked myself ""Can I survive the main course ?"" Hell yeah ...the reply I got back. Soon followed the scrumptious thalis beautifully designed with the mains dishes for the lunch. The thali had bowls of Paneer Delhi style, Pindi channa, Dal Delhi Highway , Methi matarmalai and corn palak as the curries along with hyderabadi biriyani and tandoori stuffed kulchas. Also present in the thali was the finger licking delicious rice kheer and raita to go with the biriyani. Each of the dishes compliemnted well to the complete thali and was best in taste and flavor. The masala stufffed kulchaserved as the best pairing with the dal makhni and pindi chole. Again the veg biryani was an absolute delight with the aromas and perfectly cooked long grain basmati rice.  The thali was served with the rich sweet lassi in kulhads topped with flavored dry fruits.For the desserts we had the all time popular irrestibile jalebis with rabdi, the best dessert pairing in Indian cuisine.  Service was top notch and the servers were well trained and co-operative.The place usually remains crowded in the weekends so an early reservation is must. Even the pricing is a real competitive one with the thali priced as Rs 499/- without taxes(weekdays) and Sat and Sun  Rs 650/- without taxes which ain't bad at all.Overall I felt this as one of those places where a hard core non vegetarian guy like me can think of paying one or two visits to try out their delicious offerings.  I would definitely recommend this place for any day veg dining.My rating for the place cannot be anything less than 4.5                                             fudvoyage.wordpress.com"
4.0,Delhi Highway is one amongst the 4 amazing restaurants in that area ! A newly opened place and looks like a palace from the outside. The interiors are too good and I personally loved the seating ! Gives one a feel of the authentic nawabi restaurant :) It's a pure vegetarian restaurant and the food tasted decent :) The service was quite fast ! Decently priced restaurant and a must visit place
4.0,"Delhi Highway is the new add-on to the posh 12th Main in Indiranagar. An establishment arrived recently to the Silicon city after seeing a grand success at Chennai outlet. The Delhi Highway is one of the finest and pure vegetarian restaurants in the Vicinity. Being a Vegetarian, I hardly see fine dining ones throughout the city. Perhaps, The Delhi highway filled the gap with the presence.  The restaurant Ambiance is Royal, Bright and luxury with appealing chandeliers and the overall dcor gives a feel of Modern old Delhi. The dining area extended to ground and first floors! I would definitely prefer to sit in the first floor.  I was at Delhi Highway for the weekend lunch and opted for the Thali.  My lunch started with Mint Apple Mojito (Virgin)  The drink was so refreshing and I never knew the combination of Apple & Mint before. There is a balance of both sweet & sour in the drink.  A mouthwatering Tamatar Dhaniya Shorba arrived on our table right after the Mojito; it was hot, tangy and pungent. I would call it as perfect Shorba with balanced level of spices.  In starters there were Masala Papad, Dahi Bhalla, Gol Gappa, Indo Mexican Quesadillas, Whole Wheat Phulka Tacos, Broccoli and Pesto, Charcoal Mushroom, Dahi Sheekh Kebab, Naram Dil Kebab  These starters are influenced by Italian and Mexican flavors. Thats why; we could see broccoli, pesto, quesadillas and tacos. It would be definitely wrong, if one can say Delhi Highway is an authentic north Indian restaurant. I am sure; this place would be a game changer in Bangalore. The Thali extended to Delhi style Paneer, Dal Delhi Highway, Pindi Channa, Corn Palak, Methi Matar Malai, Hyderabad Biryani, Rice, Jalebi, Rabdi, Gulab Jamoon and Lassi.  The dishes taste completely unique from the traditional & authentic kinds, which is much needed for the people who want to try something different. They do have Ala-Carte menu of regular and exotic fare!  Its an apt place for special occasions to go with families and friends!                                             bangaloreepicure.com"
2.5,"Has got to be one of my worst experiences in Bangalore as far as dining experience and ambiance goes. To stay on point, I'll borrow the list format -  1. Terrible receptionist taking reservation as if he's on a pity-trip for you 2. Very bad ambiance with kids creating a ruckus and chaos everywhere, if you're looking for a peaceful dinner, this is NOT the place 3. Terribly dirty chairs post prior guest's dinner session, morsels of food stuck on the chair cushions 4. Bad staff shouting at each other, actively fighting in the private area about some discussion, throwing towels on the table while setting it up 5. Billing error with an extra platter added, only reverted when we noticed the error upon checking  Overall, the restaurant has got an amazing infrastructure but it's the people who've clearly gotten it all wrong. Cannot NOT recommend enough."

1.0,"Called to make a reservation today for 8pm for 3 pax, and the voice on the other side asks if I'll be there at exact 8, for which I say that I cannot predict traffic but will be there by 8.15 max, and so the voice on the other side offers to make a reservation at 7.45 saying that people say 8.15 and end up coming at 8.30-8.45, with a great sense of arrogance in his voice. Making me feel like they're doing me a favour by giving me a reservation, I ask him to cancel my reservation.  It's a new restaurant in town, and I sincerely wish the best for them. But they've certainly lost me as a customer, and I'm not surely recommending this place for their sheer arrogance. If they can be so arrogant on the phone, I can only wonder how the service would be in reality."
3.5,Had been here for Friends b'day.. Interiors were damn good and looked royal. Food was not that great compared to prices they charge. Service was also not that good. I think they have decided the price on menu card based on interiors and not based on service they provide and food.
5.0,"Awesome food, ambience and service. If you love north Indian food and are vegetarian, visit here is a must.  Great detailing in interiors - richness and quality of decor, colour scheme, lighting and the feeling of lots of space in the 2 floors. They have an open space on the lower floor as you enter and that gives the feeling of space and lack of clutter.  My friend kept calling it 'Delhi Darbar' but that's because you think of the rich Darbar look rather than a highway dhaba when you are inside.  The food is mouth watering, fresh, light, spicy and that suits most of us. We opted for the thaali as it looked very interesting and covered all that we wanted to try and it ended up a very good choice."
4.5,"Delhi highway after successfully running in Chennai and Mumbai has entered namma Bengaluru and is located in the prime locality of Indiranagar. The ambiance is majestic with rich interiors giving a royal feeling. The place has two floored seating nowhere compromising to the minute of the minute detailing wrt to its interiors and is also done in such a way that it can accommodate even a large group of guests on the first floor.

The thali is priced from Mon to Fri  Rs 499/- without taxes                   and Sat and Sun  Rs 650/- without taxes Starters were served on the table starting with Apple Mojito as welcome drink, this simple drink is definitely refreshing and the crushed chunks of apple which has absorbed the mojito liquid is an absolute bliss. Tamatar Dhaniya Shorba soup was nice and had perfect consistency. Masala papad is served in a glass with cone shaped papad filled with finely chopped onions and tomatoes and mint chutney. Dahi Balla tasted so good and specially the colorful garnishing doesn't let you stop just for one. Pani puri is served with pani in a cylindrical glass containing pani and filled puri is kept on top of it, the presentation itself makes it wonderful. Starters included Charcoal mushroom, Broccoli and pesto, Dhai sheekh kebab and The naram dill kebab. Grilled over charcoal, charcoal Mushroon is my personal favourite. Broccoli and pesto is more like the in house version of Hara bara Kebab but here the tikki had green vegetables including Broccoli finely pasted and the tikki has pesto sauce on top of it. The naram dill kebab is a cheesy delight which has corn flakes coating and is served with afgani sauce. Besides, there was two fusion dishes which gets a thumps up from my side. Indo Mexican Quesadillas which are tortillas filled with baked beans,paneer,bell peppers and cheese.Whole Wheat Fulka Tacos, which is an innovative Taco with fulka as base. Main course has Paneer delhi style, Dal Delhi Highway, Pindi Chana, Corn Palak, MethiMatar Malai, Hyderabad Biryani and Salad which is served in a Large Thali plate along with Kulcha. Dal Delhi highway aka Dal Makhani is a the highlight of the section. Corn Palak has the contractive colors of green palak and yellow corn and was a treat to eyes and tummy. Even after the sumptuous meal there is always space for desserts. Jalebi with Rabdi , crispy Jalebis with Rabdi added on top had perfect sweetness and also overloaded dry fruit pieces. Gulab Jamoon which is served with Kesar for decorative purposes was soft, juicy though a bit bigger in size i literally gobbled up a few as it isn't possible for any iron will to stop at one. Lassi with dry fruits is also included in the thali. The best part is from Apple mojito to Lassi everything is unlimited. Service is very friendly and the staff were very co-operative. They also have valet parking which burdens the task of finding parking in the busy street. I would definitely recommend this place for a luxurious Veg Dining experience.                                             myhungertales.wordpress.com"
4.0,Food 5..  The Dal is out of the world.. Best i have had in Bangalore.. Competes with the famous delhi dals..  Paneer platter was impressive too..   Ambience 4.. Too spacious.. We could sense the high rentals reflecting in the pricing of the food.. (specially the breads)   Service 3 It looks like some kids circus .. All trying to figure out what to do.. In Indiranagar service has to be top notch and upmarket..

2.0,"The Staff don't have a clue about what is happening, the two senior staff who seem to know a lot are at the hostess desk handling calls and escorting guests making the floor staff run like headless chickens !! They don't know the menu, the pani Puri was good but had cranberry juice, we asked him what is this he said just add it in the Puri and eat !! While we understand the fusion drift we wanted to understand the reason behind it !! Was it a substitute for sweet chutney?? Was it just there for fun ?? Was it there for eye appeal?? The dum aloo was good ! But the attitude shown was so much that we did not care much !! The selection of bread was good !! Decent place but when we go out to a restaurant we expect decent service, the wait staff have no knowledge and the food comes it's dumped on the table and he goes away !! It's ok if you don't want to serve but at least place it with appropriately !! Your food is good do something about your overall guest experience !!"

3.0,"It has very traditional ambience. A good place to go with family. Food wise we had lots of expectations but food is average and the taste is no different from other restaurants. We started with tomato basil soup and papad churi. Soup was little sour and papad churi was just crushed papad, we expected it to be chatpata. For the main course we ordered sizzling mutter kulcha and aloo paratha combo. Kulcha was good but sizzling mutter felt like it's just boiled without any spices. Aloo paratha had no taste but the sides which were daal makhani and chole tasted awesome. Overall taste does not meet the restaurant name:)"
4.0,"This place is a Veg only gem in Indiranagar and is quite easy to spot... Was here for lunch on a weekend... First thing that would blow your mind are the royal interiors and bright lighting...  Coming to the food , Started off with apple mojito and tomato dhaniya shorba... The apple addition in the regular mojito was simple yet impressive attempt which created a positive first impression. The shorba was well prepared with a perfect balance of the tomato and the dhaniya flavor. Next we were served with masala papad, This one was rolled with the fillings and chutney inside and served in a glass, The innovative method of packaging was refreshing when it comes to the plain old way of serving it,  Before the starters arrived we were even served a couple of chaats, First was the dhai bhalla and then paani puri followed.  Starters were certainly a highlight here, Charcoal mushroom, Broccoli and pesto, dhai sheekh kebab and the naram dill kebab were served. My personal favorite was the charcoal mushroom others did not fall short either. There were a couple of starters served with a Mexican twist. One of them was the whole wheat phulka tacos and the the other being Indo-Mexican quesadillas both of which were well done retaining the Indian essence.  Unfortunately, I had to leave in the middle of my meal due to an emergency.. Planning to visit this place again soon to experience the complete meal peacefully :)                                             voiceofmytastebuds.com"

1.5,Hahaha! It's a veg only place! That was enough for me to avoid it like the plague but like most things Delhi this is 5/5 on pomp and show!  Zomato suggests it's a 1000 for 2 kind of place! If u can get thru starters and a beverage for that I ll rate this place 5! CRAP in Capital case! I don't talk like this about any new place but I give this place 6 months!
3.5,"To start of with, its an exclusive veg restaurant... I'd like to say that they've made no comprise with their interiors...beautifully done...anybody would fall in love with it...the entrance in grand, its got ground and level 1 seating arrengments with stairs from both the sides to go upstairs after you enter...Went there yesterday to celebrate a friends birthday...we were gang of 10...had to wait for more than half n hour before we could get seats and that showed that the place was popular...so finally we got our seats and browed through the menu and ordered quickly cuz we all were hungry.. ;) Started of with cream of tomato which was very ordinary and a let down..and then came paneer tikka platter, the paneer was fresh and very soft and tasted and nice...after that the food started flowing one by one, cheese aloo tandoori which was ok, tandoori fresh farm was good, kadai pasta (very indian way) just like the name suggests and for change it was nice..then came naram dil kebab which was again ok followed by dahi kebab, charcoal mushroom all were above average. The rockstar item of the night was mozzarella kulcha and dal delhi highway (recommend). The next item that came was malai kofta which was pretty ordinary in tatse. Now lets come to the bread section naan was good so was mozzarella kulcha like said earlier...tandoori roti and sheer maal was just okay.. For drinks we ordered jumping monkey (really bad), watermelon mojito (nice and refreshing), peach ice tea (taste of the tea was missing cuz peach syrup was too much in it...fresh lime soda like always, always safe..haha..so now lets come to end of the course...desert... Ordered jalebi malai and shahi tukda...the oil in which jalebi was fried was not good at all but the rabri tasted nice...and shahi tukda was also very ordinary the fried bread was very thin and the cream was too much...the shaahi ness was missing from shahi tukda...over all the food experience was average...and I would never go their personally, cuz there was nothing extraordinary that would pull me their...I also felt that the prices was very high...the taste of the food does not compliment the price at all...if I go by price non of the dishes were worth it...

4.0,"I gave a visit to this restaurant with my friends. Initially, I was bit disappointed with the restaurant after having a look at the menu as the restaurant claims to be a pure vegetarian resturant. However, the food is really amazing. We ordered Dahi Ke Kebab in starters and Lahori Paneer & Malai Kofta in main course. Every dish was mouth watering.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and would surely love to give another visit."

2.5,"Gave this restaurant a second chance after a disappointing first visit. Well, it was still a disappointing fare.  The ambiance is decent. Food and service as good/ bad as a Shanthisagar. At Rs 787 for a Thali, one expects a lot more. The spread is impressive, alas the same can't be said about the taste! Don't think I'll give this place a 3rd chance anytime soon. At a similar pricepoint, Rasovara UB City offers a far, far better experience!"
4.0,Pretty much new and equally refreshing. The quantity in the Thali is lesser than usual which is a huge plus. I am sure all of us at some point in time would have felt the need to be judicious with food. The quantity is just right so that no food is wasted. It really takes courage to follow this method in times of unlimited and so much food that the usual Thali players serve. Kudos for this !
4.5,"The name of this place should be renamed to Delhi Palace simply because from outside itself, the place looks like Palace and if you have any doubts about the same, then they are cleared as soon as you enter the place. I Visited this place last weekend with my wife and in-laws ! We started our meal with ordering for couple of soups and starters. In soup we ordered for Tomato Shorbha and Corn & Spinach soup. Both of them were really good. In starters we ordered for Paneer Platter and Pesto kebab. Both the dishes were delicious !  In main course we ordered for Dal Delhi Highway (Dal Makhani) which was bad, Paneer Lababdaar which was amazing and Diwani Handi which was good too. In breads we ordered for Tandoori Roti and Onion Kulcha. The kulcha wasn't that great as it contained too much oil and was dripping out of it. We also ordered for their special dish Sizzling Matar Kulche and it was very delicious in taste ! The service was good but can be improved a bit more !"
5.0,"The name is little misleading as one might expect a dhaba type menu. But this is a North Indian vegetarian cuisine. I have been here to meet my foodie friends and love it's location in the quite posh neighbourhood. The interiors are nice and the menu has good variety.  When come to food we started with welcome drink Apple Mojito and Tomatar dhaniyo shorba with masala papad. Tomatar shorba which was not sweet, and tasted unlike most restaurant soups, very close to home made. Masala papad served cigar style( slightly messy to eat, but a nice try at innovative masala papad ) . Then the chats dhahi bhalla and golguppe.  Then, the starters charcoal mushroon, Barccoli pesto, Naram dil Kebab and many more. Charcoal mushroom perfectly stuffed with cottage cheese and spices. You must try charcoal mushroom.I like the desserts very much. Especially Jilebi - Rabri it was very tasty and a fitting end to a good meal. At last  lassi to finish it off in Delhi style.

3.5,"Newbie in town with the royal fine dining in the heart of Namma Benguluru. Delhi highway with its Majestic exteriors is a new heartthrob to dine in Indiranagar with its Delhi cuisine and more a North indian cuisine place. Located at 12th main, Delhi Highway is offering Royal Thali, the main attraction in here.                                                                 ...Read full post on sakhiravoordiaries.wordpress.com"
3.5,"Newbie in town.  In the heart of Bangalore.. Delhi Highway traveled all over and came in here to feed vegetarian delicacies of Delhi and North Indian cuisine in 12th Main and Indiranagar.  They have Majestic Exteriors and Royal interiors with decent service. Service was slow and had delicacies enough time to taste ( as was Invited) their delicacies.  Its more like a North Indian cuisine. I was there around 1:20pm and tasted all the varieties as all were vegetarian.  We started with the Apple Mojito with a little more than usual mint flavor but I loved though.  Then came the Shoba Tamatar Dhaniya was WOW.  Then the chats as we know Delhi are famous for these.   Dahi Bhalla, Gol Guppe, Presentations made them more attractive.   Then, the starters Charcoal Mushrooms were out of world, Indo Mexican fusion food like Indo Mexican Quesadillas, Whole Wheat Fulka tacos and Broccoli pesto were ok ok, Dahi sheek Kebab and Naram Dil Kebab were good.  Then came the Royal Thali with Paneer Delhi style, Dal Delhi Highway, Pindi Chana, Corn Palak, Methi Matar Malai, and Hyderabadi Biryani served with the Tandoor Mini Kulcha, stuffed with Onion Paneer.  Then finally time for time for Desserts, Jalebi Rabdi, famous Gulab Jamoon and Lassi..!!  Was a nice time with foodies and came out with a nice feel of taste  My Ratings:  Ambiance and Service: 5/5  Food : 3.8/5  Taste : 3.8/5  Price:  decent for a Fine dine.  All the above items include The Royal thali which costs   Weekdays: 499/-+taxes  Weekends: 650/-+taxes                                             sakhiravoor.wordpress.com"
1.0,"This is the first time visited Delhi highway after recommended by our close friend. I would like to narrate the experience. We entered the Restaurant around 10.45pm after we were asked to seat the captain came to take the order , before we could order he was in such a hurry to close the Resturant , then why did they ask to to be seated if they were closing .... Now that every dish we wanted to order he stated this is the time to close , last order , last order ..,,, he did not give us the time to think and we needed to order the speciality dishes of the Resturant. We had to order in such a hurry, the pani Puri, assorted paneer tikka platter , paneer Vege , Roti , Hyderabadi biryani, Delhi dal , aloo Tikki, Indian style pasta which was a shock of the life after repeating and telling him with out mushroom the chef ended up adding mushrooms in the pasta.   Now we stated to get the order one by one and the service was pathetic. The food served was not well cooked. We hardly ate any portions and we left the food over . After few min the bill was given and the next shock was they are openly cheating public on the vat collection as they are suppose to absorb the vat component but the manager was so rude to us as he had no explanation to give us. This was rude of this guy. The other customers were also asking for explaining but no reply from the manager or management.   I want to say the overall experience was bad and that the Restaurant is not up to the expected mark and hyped. I would never recommend any one to go there for food. The service and food is pathetic. Now that I was shocked is that after repeated requests they served mushrooms to us in the dish. The most disgusting part of the experience. Pls be careful if next time if u order food u will have to check before u start to eat.   For sure this is the last visit to this restaurant. Not worth the price also what they are charging as the quality is pathetic for sure.   Ramanand Agarwal"
3.0,"The vegetarian fare tingled my taste buds.  Was happy to see choice available for Veg only restaurant.  Though the restaurant has been opened more than a month ago,  the staff is not yet settled in.  The service needs a serious rethinking.  Got my orders delivered to me twice! That too after multiple follow up and coaxing.  The staff on the ground was apologetic,  assuming the problem lies with the management than the actual foot soldiers.  Would like to go back if the service improves."
1.0,"We visited this restaurant last week, we ordered Punjabi Thali and sorry to say it was really pathetic as someone has rightly mentioned in reviews there is nothing like Punjabi here. For thali worth of 650 rupees these guys serve beetroot halawa and the worst part of this restaurant is their service extremely slow and poor.  If they would have served this thali for 200 bucks I would have definitely recommended but for 650 not at all worth, don't waste ur money, stay away don't get attracted by attractive ambience."
4.0,excellent ambience!!! the food is tasty too but very slow in serving the food on the table and takes much tym to get our food after being ordered except this overall good place for family dinners and its a pure vegetarian resturant
1.0,"ONE OF THE WORST RESTAURANT, EVER SEEN. THEY TRY TO CHEAT THE CUSTOMER. WE HAD BEEN TO THIS RESTAURANT ON 15TH AUGUST AROUND 8.45 PM, PLACED ORDER FOR STARTER & MAIN COURSE. IN SPITE OF  SEVERAL REMINDERS, HE BOUGHT THE STARTER AFTER 45 MIN, IT WAS COLD AS IF HE HAS BEEN BOUGHT FROM THE FREEZER . BOUGHT TO THE NOTICE TO THE MANAGER & GM THEY R NOT BOTHERED ABOUT THE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK. THIS RESTAURANT IS ONLY FOR SHOW OFF, FOOD QUALITY IS VERY VERY BAD. WE REQUEST THE CUSTOMER NOT TO GO AND WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR NOT WORTH. A SMALL RESTAURANT IS FOR BETTER."
1.0,"Please don't get your hopes high with the name ""Delhi"". There is nothing which will remind you of Delhi here. Except for the ambience everything else about this new joint in Indira Nagar is below average. We ordered cream of mushroom soup and dahi seekh kabab and with this we got to know how bad the food was. We didn't even dare to order main course. The cream of mushroom soup had an uncanny sour taste. I have never had such pathetic mushroom soup before. The dahi seekh kabab were cold and tasteless. I wonder if they were serving me the left over from yesterday. And not to forget the poor service. One of them didn't even know what was there on the menu. He had no idea whatsoever. The staff looked detached and the overall service was quite bad. I don't think I will be visiting this place again."
1.0,Ambience is good but the food quality is bad. Found a hair in garlic naan. Tomato ketchup was not available. Had to ask multiple times for water. Overall experience was bad.
4.0,"Delicious and heavy food, living to the expectations of Delhi side cuisine. Service can be improved a bit. Had the Sunday thali over there. Slightly overpriced, but the food is so filling and yummy that overprice tends to get sidelined."
4.5,"Awesome food at Delhi Highway. Must try the dahi kebab and dal out here. Would surely want to visit this place next time, and try some more dishes on the menu."
4.0,"Loved the place!! Good food, great ambience. We ordered paneer tikka, masala papad,dahi ke kebab,mozarella cheese kulcha,panner labadaar,black dal and biryani. Biryani was ok. Others were worth the try!! We ordered even going dal halwa.."
3.0,"Good Ambience - Average food.  Any new place brings a sense of excitement which drives me towards this place. As an ambience this place would be rated 4.5/5 , it gives you that soothing atmosphere of a good highway type Dhaba.   Food : 3/5  It is only a vegetarian restaurant and does not serve liquor.  The menu has lot of options which sets your expectations remarkably high about the the Delhi cuisine but unfortunately the quality of the food was not even close and comparable to north indian Food. We explored chaats ( pani puri, Tikki chat ) along with spinach and corn soup.  The tikki should have been piping hot instead they were pre made and  served room temperature with curd and chutneys, the soup has sour taste and pani puri  were too costly for the portion served.  we also tried mozzarella paratha which were not cheesy enough to tickle your taste buds  The service was slow and the stewards were new and were less experienced in terms of the type of cuisine. Overall the restaurant needs lot to prove in the current competition and the coming times would tell which side of the coin would the place be ."
3.5,"A good place, good ambience and service. Loved the mozzarella kulcha. A very good place for fusion food. The chaats here were a disappointment. But otherwise had a good time."
4.0,Food - very good food. Desserts were very average but all other items were well made. We were a large group taking a la carte so we tasted many dishes.  Service - service is slow and a bit uncoordinated. People having set menu had to remind staff of dishes missed out. We had to even ask them to serve water after 15 mins or so of taking the table and also refill water. Staff were however courteous.  Place - place is not as exotic as shown in the photos but quite good. Best part is that the place is pure veg.
2.0,Good News for all you Vegetarians. Yes it's a pure vegetarian restaurant. So all you non vegetarians should be aware.  The taste of the food was nothing extraordinary. However if you're looking for food which is very simple and bland this place is just for you .  Something to alert all you foodies about is the price. I honestly don't think paying 79/- for a samosa is worth it . It's an extremely expensive food joint.  Ambiance is marvelous.  I had channa Bhatura which was 300/- and I would love to pay that much for it if it was lipsmacking.  The staff is extremely polite however the service is slow.
2.0,Good ambience but service and food quality not as gr8 as expected from an authentic Delhi restaurant. They need to work and improve on their service qualities.
5.0,If there is heaven in earth.. It's surely delhi higway.. A must visit place.. Why the hell am I 13 days late.. Should have visited this place on the very first day.. The food is just too amazing.. Best place of indira nagar...
4.0,We visited this newly open dine-in on a Friday eve. If you're looking for a decent family dine place. This is where you should head the next time.  The entrance is unmingled from my prospective and would request you'ol to dine on first floor.  The soups are decently made ( I think they should add more variety to it) and starters were nicely cooked and good to eat (we liked kabuli kabab the most from what we ordered).  Food portions are decent and food served is delicious.  Thumbs up for the place.
5.0,A restaurant with good ambience but with pathetic service.  Confusion among the staff..  service is too bad. Have to wait for 20 mins to serve the food and then  almost 30 mins for roti to come. Food was good but service was bad
5.0,"Nice place to go to. Do try the dahi ke kebab and the dal here.. The quality of food and the ambience is good. And most of all, it is light on your pocket!"
4.5,This is a must visit place for those who love north Indian food.Very good ambiance and interior. Paneer Lababdar and dal Delhi highway are must try!
4.0,"Great good, amazing ambience and for.more details please check facebook , twitter and instagram for a detailed review on the same venue showcasing their unique dishes."
2.5,"restaurant ambience looks extremely amazing. Serve full oily masala papad after main course. Extremely Disappointed with the food timely service. Confusion in between the employees for service. Dal Makhani a lil different than other restaurant, but have tasted better in Namma Bengaluru. Lassi didn't turn up not even with the bill. !!!!"
5.0,"Finally a good north Indian restaurant in indiranagar !!! A perfect place for a Sunday lunch. Tried their thali and it was simply superb. Starters like naram Dil kabab, makki kabab and paneer tikka was nice and a must try and the main course was good enough with a decent spread in your thali. Lassi with malai was the awesome way to end the buffet."
5.0,"Amazing place to be at wid ur friends or family.And for all foodies must order items ""malai kofta"" and ""palak lehsuni paneer"". PS: Loved the ambience too"
5.0,One place to b for vegetarians! If you are bored of usual South Indian vegetarian and want to try something authentic then Delhi highway should top your option bucket!
5.0,Visited this place yesterday. A pure veg North indian resutrant !! Rare to find one these days :) the dahi ke sekh kebab and dal makhnai were super delicious !! Ambience is that like a darbaar !! Loved it. Would visit again :)
4.5,Finally a fantastic North Indian restaurant in Indiranagar! This is one of the best Dal Makhni that we have had in the city. The kebabs are great too!
5.0,Happy to be the first one to review Delhi highway Bengaluru! Have been to the Mumbai outlet and this one looks like they have gone a step ahead and made it look fab!  The ambience undoubtedly is awesome and quite unique and classy.   Had been to this place with office colleagues and had a thali again.. This one was diff than what we had in Mumbai but definitely it was nothing less than awesome. It's a perfect place for food connoisseurs who love to relish on good vegetarian North Indian food.. Which again is difficult to find in South esp when it comes to places that serve thalis or buffet..everything looks perfect right from ambience to the food presentation and taste.   A must try!
