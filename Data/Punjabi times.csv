3.0,"This restaurant is located at the top floor of the building. It's got a shady darker ambience about it. I have been here twice. One was during New Year time which expectedly made the service very slow. Otherwise in normal days, the service here is okay. Specialised in North Indian food. You should be having a typical North Indian meal here which includes Naan, Kulcha, Dal Makhani and Paneer sabzis. Try Lassi too. The place has live music which is kind of not very exciting"
1.0,"We went for a Team Lunch today, and the food, especially Veg was pathetic. The starters were ordinary, the gravies were bland, and the pastries were very sweet.  The only things I found tasty were - Chole, Sarson Ka Saag, Gulab Jamun, Paan Kulfi."
3.0,The ambience is cool. Looks different. The food was okay. Had higher expectations particularly because of the price point. Only the butter chicken was good. An overall about average experience.
1.0,Very Bad Experience at this restaurant  Order the food and it took them an hour to serve the food. The food was way below average. They made us wait for an hour unapologetically for a very below average food. The murgh curry which we ordered was pretty bad.  The worst part is they charge a 7.5% service charge over and above the menu rates for the bad service and food.   Very bad Friday evening dinning experience we had at this place.
4.0,"Been there yesterday with family, overall a good experience, very nice ambience with nice setup of punjabi theme, punjabi alphabets, bangle, maps of punjab made with katoris, well running water, phulkari based menu. Overall a good ambience with live music and singer singing nice songs When it comes to food, we ordered railway murg and paneer started which had stuffing along with lahori shikanji and fresh lime soda, overall a great start with starters  Maincourse we ordered dal makhni which can be made better and malai kofta which was quiet sweet. I mean little more than it should be . All in all a great experience, a time well spent at a cozy corner table with music and starters  Ambience -4/5 Food - 3.5/5 Staff - 3/5 Location 4/5 Price: Slightly over priced"
5.0,"Beautiful and unique ambience. The lighting is peaceful. The idea to use bangle wrapper over the light is unique.  Service is decent and staff is courteous. Food is tasty and worth for the money spent.  I tried their, Aam panna Tandoori khumb te bhutte Amristari masala papad Chil mil subji Mix roti, rumali roti and pulka Badami Rabdi  The food is tasty and rotis are soft. Aam panna could make one crave for more.   Tip: chil mil subji is a Must try. Its properly made with mixture of beans, kaju, chole which made it yummy. Do try it."
1.0,"I visited this place with my friends on this Sunday( 5th May). We reached there around 3 o clock and ordered food. First of all the food was Okish, but that was not our point of disappointment, it was the service which was pathetic. When we ordered jeera rice during mid meal, the waiter informed us that the kitchen was closed. So we were like OK, please get us the steamed rice then ( which I am sure is readily available), but the waiter was adamant that kitchen was closed. We understand that kitchen might be closed some time, but if any customer is having food then at least he/ she should be informed about the 'last order'. Highly disappointed with the service. Dear management please make a note of this."
5.0,"I would highly suggest their weekday lunch buffet both for vegetarians and non-vegetarians!  Punjabi Times for me is their buffet - great food, good combination of dishes and at a really good price. I also really liked the service, fast and efficient.  One should not miss this place.."
5.0,Dal Makhni Butter chicken and some naan - life is good!!  The staff was very cordial and responsive.  The food truly is lip smacking.  Visit this place if you already havent.  We will visit soon!!!   Yummy food in my tummy..
5.0,"One of my favorite places for chicken tikka and rogan gosh!!  Also I have tried few vegetarian dishes and they too were equally tasty, but I am a non-veggie so I stick to chicken.  If you crave for non veg food you should definitely try this place.  Dal makhni was so flavourful and naan was soft and tasted yum!  Good place to eat good food!"
2.0,"Food is just not authentic in taste. Beginning from starters and then main course, nothing delighted the taste palatte. It may be good for people who don't know the North Indian taste and that's why such high ratings of 4.1. But if you are looking for authentic tasting Punjabi food this place is not recommended. The recommended Dal makhani didn't have any shred of makhan in it. Though service was good and staff was courteous, but the main objective for which you eat outside was missing from the experience. Not going again."
5.0,"The food was delicious ..  I think, anything you order will be delicious here, I have come here thrice and ordered and tried so many different items - most of them were just delicious.  Staff are polite too.  A lovely experience and a must visit for all.."
5.0,I have had both non-veg and veg dishes here so I can comment on the overall quality and taste of the food. While non-vegetarians will like this place for obvious reasons but vegetarians also do have an amazing array of delicious dishes in their plate too...  I am a big fan of their sarso ka saag and dal Makhni add some butter chicken to that list and you have a winner meal.
4.0,This is a place for all North Indian food lovers. The menu has a lot of variety. My person favourite of all is the daal makhani here. Thats a must try. Though I ordered Rabri which was not up to the mark. It didnt tasted fresh.
5.0,"Authentic north Indian food.  The ambiance is really nice, feels very warm and seating is comfortable too.  We did try quite a few items from the menu both, veg and non-veg and liked the food a lot.  A definite go to place in Bellandur for punjabi food experience."
4.0,The starters platter was value for money and it tasted too good. The customised singing part is a bonus. Overall experience was definitely good.
5.0,I have placed orders and also dined here and both of my experience has been a good one!!  Bellandur really lacks good restaurants and in such a situation I am glad that we have Punjabi Times!  Ambiance is very warm and also coming here on a weekend you definitely need to book a table.  Starters were really good and so was desserts..
5.0,A delight for all north indian lovers is this place called Punjabi Times!!  They never fail to impress and satisfy their customers.   I came here 2 weeks ago with my closest friends and I had the best time ever.. The environment is so soothing and nice.  Presentation is good.  Options in food are plenty. I really like coming here..
4.0,The buffet was too good and having all type of dishes in the menu. Went with the team and it was just awesome. Rate wise also economical and the staffs were too kind . Loved the food and also the songs were awesome.
5.0,"So, when thinking of a place to take your parent to who love eating like you do, it becomes trickier. Finally I decided to dine at this place because honestly, bellandur ain't indiranagar. Considering punjabi times is a north indian place, it was right up my alley. The ambiance is decent. Also, the staff are polite and efficient too. We indeed had a good dinner here."
5.0,"Good experience and very good quality of food..............  Portion of food was also excellent ...........  We tried a lot of vegetarians dishes and really like it, they food was cooked to perfection...  Also I have to mention that the service too was so good, really amicable bunch of staff. Would come back soon to gorge on some yummy north Indian food..."
5.0,"Just the aroma of the food here will make you hungry...  Punjabi Times is a wonderful place for eating.. The hospitality, the ambiance, the service, the food is worth every penny!  You will savor each bite.. My experience here has always been  good.  Recommend this place for people who love eating.."
4.0,"It's in bellundur on top floor* the restaurant has a good view* the decor is reasonably good, coming to food if you love punjabi food this is the place. Must visit"
4.0,Been here I think gazillion times. Tried lots of different items. Last night I went there with my wife for a quick dinner. We ordered Paneer butter masala. It was pretty good. With butter naan and it was the best naan i have had in a long time. Ordered tandoori roti as well which was okay as usual. But nothing as compared to naan:p So the bottom line is you should definitely try this place.
5.0,"I love north Indian food, if you ask me which is my favorite cuisine i'll say north Indian. I love dal makhni and naan, best combo ever made. Naturally, I am drawn to places like punjabi times. The ambiance is decent but the food is marvelous. Really liked the food and the experience."
1.0,For most pathetic buffet experience please visit the place. The service is so beautiful that they don't serve you water unless you Order Aquafina. At any given time my house party would have have more options than this buffet.They didn't clean table for 20 mins even though we asked mutliple times
5.0,"You can go to Punjabi Times with family, extended family, friends and colleagues!!  The place has a great ambiance really earthy and warm.  Food, good place for vegetarians as well, their dal makhni is very very delicious..  Highly recommended restaurant in Bellandur.."
5.0,The service is great and the ambiance is amazing.  The food is awesome with a good variety. There is enough for vegetarians and non vegetarians both.   My most favorite vegetarian dish has to be dal makhni!!!  The overall dining experience was great and it is a must visit place if you're looking for some good quality Punjabi food.
5.0,I am a huge fan of Punjabi Times..  Been visiting this place for months now.. very close to my place and the one place that services some amazing punjabi food..  The buffet here is my fav...  For the price it comes at such value for money place...  Would highly recommend everyone.
3.0,"|| Sunday Dinner ||  Went there last night in a group of 5 people for quick dinner.  Ambience/Music: The ambience is nice. Gives a full Punjabi touch. The special part here is the live music. The singer is awesome and I loved his music. I just wish the lights were a bit bright.  Staff/Service: The staff is extremely nice and polite. Quick in their service.  Food: In food we ordered Chicken Tikka Alisan, Veg Seekh Kabab in starters. Liked the chicken starter but the veg starter was just okay. In main course we ordered Butter Naan, Chicken Rara and Chicken Tikka Lababdar along with Lassi, Coke and Jaljeera. I wish the chickens were a bit more tasty. I did not like the main course here much. Though starters and lassi were good.  #PhoneCameraFoodLife #ChickenTikkaLababdar #ButterNaan #ChickenTikka #ChickenRara #VegSeekhKabab"
5.0,As I sit down to write this review I can't help but think about the amazing experience I had recently at Punjabi times with my family.  The ambiance is very good.  The options in the menu are plenty and also the service is good.   The food was heavenly.  Can't wait to come here again..
1.0,"Don't know why this place is given 4.1 rating. The moment we enter this place there was some weird smell which was unbearable. Then we started with the starter 'khaas bhunne bhutte', there was just oil and no spices, it was tasteless. We told him about this and by the time he replaced that with another one, our main course was about to finish. We ordered paneer tikka masala that too was not good and Naan was overcooked. It was not at all a good experience for us. I would not like to visit this place ever again."
2.0,"The place is not worth of 4.1 rating. We went for a Team Lunch and have below thought about this joint.  Food: Food is not more than Average. With a very less food options. (In the same price you will get better options in in restaurants near by)  Ambience: Not at all classy / Very Shady. Music was pathetic and the AC does not work as they are under renovation (It is not a good time to go)  Service : A series of NO & WE CANNOT were there from the very beginning of the party. We went with our client and asked them specifically to present the food well. We kept on asking for a refill but they were too lazy to act on the request. Hence we stopped asking and went on to the dessert section. At the end they came up with lots of starter. Guys were not very keen to serve.  Overall, i would give a 2.9 to 3 for this place and never recommend for a corporate party. Yes it is good for people who want to get sloshed and eat Punjabi style.. and can bare Yo Yo Honey Singh..."
5.0,A north Indian restaurant with a good dining experience.  I like the fact that they serve authentic North Indian food without any gimmicks. Just simple and flavorful.  Be it a family get together or celebration of a special occassion..you will not feel disappointed with your choice. Highly recommend !!
1.0,"If you want to go just for name go , otherwise zero taste ,had been three times and always had very bad experience, unsupported stafff , saying again just name nothing else"
5.0,"Every non-vegetarian should come and eat here..  Butter chicken  Chicken kebab  Rogan josh.  The list is just never ending, the food here certainly is finger licking good.   I am glad I discovered this place, have been to their other outlet as well.   Recommended, can definitely come with friends or families !"
5.0,"The food is too hygenic and good quality too.   Style of serving is very nice.   Staff is very polite and humble !!  The food is so finger licking delicious!!  Overall I must say, great ambience, great food and courteous staff.you can spend great time here."
5.0,My all time favourite. Try makai ki roti sarso da saag and crispy baby corn. Ambience below average but food is good. A family restaurant and you may opt this when you want just a tummy full food and not a lavish pub-kind-an-ambience.
5.0,Good place - great service. Portions are generous too!!  Come enjoy the ambiance place your order and sit back and relax to the good music playing in the background...  Trust me once they serve the food you will not be able to stop eating.  Great place for north Indian food...
5.0,Had a wonderful time here. The service was excellent and the food too was excellent.  Definitely seeing myself become a regular here.  A must visit for people who enjoy having Punjabi Cuisine. The food was really yummy and in good portions.  We will come soon!!!
4.0,"This place was an absolute delight!  Firstly I came here for lunch and then with my friends for dinner.. The food was yum, both veg and non-veg starters were yummy..  Ideal place to take your parents as well.  Highly recommended."
5.0,"Considering the no of restaurants in Bangalore, you are way too spoilt for choices.  Also, sometimes you should go back to few places like Punjabi Times which reminds you that you should be visiting this place often.  I like the ambiance, interiors are done really nice.  Also, food A+++++++  We have tried veg and non-veg dishes and both impressed us equally."
5.0,"Ambience is great. They have amazing live music and voice of the singer creates a different vibe that soaks you in. Friendly staff and decent speed service. Coming to food, I had veg food which was good. They gave us some pan ice-cream kindof thing at the end. My evening was well spent, thanks to the restaurant and staff!"
2.0,"Had heard a lot about the food here before going. However, I found the quantity to be really less. We had ordered a paneer dish, which was bland. That's not what I expected when I came to a Punjabi place. Compared to so many North Indian restaurants here, I was disappointed."
5.0,Service 4/5 Taste 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Love their spreads on buffet Amazing place Superb service  Would surely recommend this place Their butter chicken is something to die for
4.0,Food is too good. Palak papri chat is one of its kind. A perfect place to have North Indian food and live music is a cherry to the cake ! Would highly recommend the place !
5.0,"Nice place with desi interiors.  Authetic punjabi food. Taste is super.  All the dishes we had ordered were super yummy, had such a fantastic lunch here. If you are a hard core non-vegetarian or a vegetarian who loves paneer and dal you'll have a good time here.  To sum all this up I had a great time here. Keep it up !!"
4.0,"I went to punjabi times on a Sunday evening...it was a nice experience as the food,restaurant ambience everything was great,they also provide live singing.only the prices are little high but it is worth it."
5.0,"The food is one of a kind and best in quality and taste.  A good dining experience with your family.   When you are craving for yummy north Indian food and you have tried almost all the places in Bangalore and you still come back here, you know the food is really good.  Staying in Bellandur this place is one of the perks for sure.  If you haven't visited here then give it a try, it's a paradise for foodies"
5.0,"I have come here on several occasions and my experience has been very good.  Lately I came here with my family of 5 and we had a good time. The staff greeted us politely, the ambiance was good and the seating was comfortable.  Food, we stuck to veg dishes and loved it - the dal makhni - I can eat everyday.   I highly recommend this place to everyone."
5.0,The ambience was absolutely amazing.  The staff was polite and courteous.   I visited Punjabi Times with my friend for dinner 2 nights ago.   The food is very delicious with the right mix of spices.   This place is a delight for all the north Indian food lovers in Bangalore.
5.0,Amazing place for North Indian food.  We ordered naan served with Paneer Lababdar and fresh vegetable Raita.  Everything was so delicious that we end up ordering more.   This places deserves many visits. Do visit here to enjoy food.
5.0,All the punjabi dishes one can crave for can be found here.  The place has done up the ambiance really really well. Makes you feel like you are in punjab.  Good place for families and friends and colleagues basically anyone who enjoys good food with good company will come here. The staff are very courteous and also good at suggesting amazing items.
5.0,Great ambiance..  I really like the starters and the desserts.. Variety is also good.. For vegetarians they have some really good options and also dishes like dal makhni are my favorite here..  Quantity and quality both are good.  Would visit again for sure.
3.0,"I visited this place and found that the food was ok - neither good nor bad. However, one of the challenges was the quality of service. It has a lot of scope for improvement. The place was running almost full and the staff looked very confused. There was a long wait before anybody would attend your table and sometime it took forever to get the food to the table. A nice place, in general, but definitely there is scope for improvement on services."
2.0,We had been here on Friday for lunch with office collugue s. First thing we felt was we had a bad smell once we entered the restraurent. Food we ordered all veggie starter which had no salt or nor nor some spice to it. We ordered tandoori platter which was avg taste. They took very long time to serve which has no much taste. Only Punjabi biryani was good for which I gave 2starts. I wont recommend people if your going for ala kart menu.
5.0,"Awesome Food. Chicken, Mutton and every dish we ordered was mouth melting stuff. Went with family and friends. Will give full rates for everything."
5.0,"One of the best place in Bellandur Punjabi Times for specially food .Visited to this place many times and whenever I have ordered food it just amazing. Monday to Friday they served lunch buffet,the verity of food was absolutely great . Ambience is good totally punjabi tradition I really loved this place . Apart from food the service was good ,staff are so friendly with customers if I can say James and Manoj and others staffs are very helpful whenever we ask something immediately they will get to table ,nice experience for me to visit to this place . And I have noticed they have done many corporate get together parties, I think this is one of the best place to do family get together also.  Finally I personally suggest to all my friends if you guys are really prefer completely Indian and Punjabi food Pls be visit to this place you will get different experience:) Overall experience for me  !!"
5.0,oh my god this place has to be my favourite.  Its a place that serves punjabi food with punjabi ambience ..  Food is delicious.  Staff are polite and good with their work.  I would love to visit this place again and again and again and forever
4.0,Good ambience with nice lovely music. The rotis and the desserts at the place were good. But everything else including the service needs to get up a notch. Decent experience overall.
5.0,"The live singers here who sing are amazing. I come here for the experience for sure.  The food is fabulous and also the ambiance.  Cannot not mention the service as well, very well trained staff who are polite too.  Thali is definitely something I would opt for if I am coming here..  You will never be disappointed here."
5.0,Excellent North Indian food flavor! There is explosion of taste in your mouth with every bite! Service was great.  Ambiance was also good!!!  Great in taste and sufficient quantity was served.  Overall experience was good!!!!
5.0,I came here with my family for Saturday lunch and it was amazing.  Hint of punjabiness in every snack and dish they prepare. As we all know that Punjab and punjabis are known for their hospitality. They also did not disappoint us with their hospitality.   Service is exceptional.  All in all a good experience.
2.0,The ambiance of the place is nothing exceptional. The food was almost bad and the time taken for service was too long. Terrible. Only the murgh makhni among the dishes ordered was worth having. Would surely not recommmend this place.
3.0,"I am not sure why it was given 4.1 star. We went for a lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. The moment we entered this place it was smelling weird. We asked the staff and they just sprayed another pungent room freshner. After getting settled down we ordered for soup both veg and non-veg. It was not warm and felt like water only. The starters like bhendi kurkure, and non veg platter was good though. But again the main course was unsatisfactory. The garlic naan was good but the chicken curry had lots of tomatoes. The mutton curry was good. Last we had the desserts which was served after a huge gap."
1.0,"Today I went to Punjabi Times for lunch with my wife kid and friend who was down from US. I ordered Paneer Lahori, Rara Chicken, Dal Makhni, Butter Naan and Tandoori Roti... To my utter belief and shock the food was horrendous, cold and tasteless. In the first place it took almost 35-40mins to get the ordered food and that too cold. There was just no taste in any of the dishes. My friend who was down from US just didn't eat anything. Also the restaurant was smelling quite weird... Smelt like public toilet as we entered. This was not the first time I have been there but I guess this was the most horrible, horrific and terrible experience. Gave a piece of mind to management as well but they didn't seem to have anything to say or acknowledge the fact that the customer had a bad experience. I guess the management and the staff has changed and this looks like Punjabi Times going to have a tough time as the competition is picking up really quick. There are many more Punjabi, mughlai and and Indian food serving places in and around the area coming up which are far better, so choose your option carefully."
4.0,I went there yesterday (20.01.2019) for dinner and the food was just above average. We ordered tawa murgh in NV and for veg we requested a gravy based vegetable for which the waiter suggested us Paneer tikka masala which was totally dry. The ambience is awesome with live singer which I guess is only on weekend. Sweet lassi and masala pappad were good. We also ordered tomato shorba which was pathetic. I have been there 2-3 times earlier but the quality has deteriorated this time. The food deserves 3 star but 1 extra star for the singer.
5.0,"I visit this place for the sake of delicious khumb de bhutte. The service is quick and polite here. The ambience is musical, doesn't feel noisy. The roof is creatively designed with bangles."
1.0,The starters were ok. But main course was very bad. Service was also not good. Only the singer was good who was singing Kishor Kumars song.
1.0,"We ordered almost 12 items for 15-18 guys. Starters were okay. Most of the dishes like butter chicken . Paneer makhani , they literally make it sweet. Sweet means sweet which they gave disclaimer so that we cant dare to order . Rest of the dishes were so pathetic and the prices are more than a continental restuarant. Extra Chatni was served after the starters were over. Water was given very late. Dal tadka (lol it didnt have tadka). Dal makhani was bland. Rogan josh. All chicken gravies were very very basic stuff and did not match up to their rates. Lahori murg.makhan wala paneer etc. Nothing was mouth watering.on top of that they added two dishes extra in bill worth 560. So we didnt dare to order sweet dishes. Lol."
1.0,To be honest worst music ever in a Punjabi restaurant no Punjabi music so dull environment and everyone looks damn sleepy!!!! :( Time and money wasted!!!!! :(
2.0,Ambience was ok but too noisy as we sat next to singer was singing songs. Food was somewhat ok because Rara Paneer I did not find it worth to catch my taste
2.0,Expensive for the test and the quality. I would not recommend. However you will get good services because hardly there will be some people eating in such a big restaurant hall. ;)  The street food in front of Marathahalli is better compare to taste and price.
2.0,"Poor Service, We ordered Sarson ka saag, Makke di roti. Sarson ka saag was not at all authentic.  They have a Live Music which was good. Ambience is old."
1.0,The service is horrible here. We had to wait for an hour to get our food. Meanwhile no waiter was even attending or looking at out table to avoid any questions. Sarso ka saag had no flavor or spices at all. Makki ki roti was not properly cooked. Very bad in terms of service and food. Only good point was live music.
5.0,"Friday lunch buffet had good options for both veg and non veg dishes. Specially liked crispy bread crumb fish fry starter and chicken Tikka. Veg cheese roll and baby corn fry were also well made. They had chat counter, lassi and jaljeera drinks additional to regular menu which we liked. Sweets were of good quality. Only negative factor was slow service, it was a long wait to get roti/kulcha basket, may be sudden rush was a reason for it."
5.0,"The live music was so good! It was all old calming hindi songs, the food was good but not very spicy even after requesting. The service and ambience 5/5. A great place for families and people to go and enjoy the comfort homely food, along with the music."
5.0,"I tend to find best Punjabi food in every Location I go and thus my choice for this restaurant. So we ordered the following here: 1. Non Veg Punjabi Thali 2. Veg Punjabi Thali  Non-Veg Thali had: Mutton Gravy, Chicken Gravy, Dal Tadka, Dry chicken, masala salad, raita, gulab jamun, papad, chicken biryani and 2 tandoori rotis.  Veg thali had: Shahi Paneer, Dal Tadka, Jeera Aloo, Raita, Masala salad, gulab jamun, cheese balls, veg pulao, papad and 2 tandoori rotis.  - were served with - Soup and Paan ice cream too."
4.0,"authentic punjabi cusines with some delightful chartbuster dishes on the menu..... and so delicios food...ambiance is really nice... especially butter chiken,sarso da saag and gosh are so tastey....!"
3.0,We ordered Kakori Kabab and Bhatti Da Murg along with aam ka panna & shikanji which was good.. However the last dish was Tandoori Macchi which was not fresh and the taste was awful.
1.0,"They are charging service tax 7.5% extra plus normal GST 5%. Extra servixe charge is not mentioned in Zomato and service charge is not mandatory at all. After lots of arguments, they didnt exclude the service charge."
3.0,Ambience is good and with live music it's awesome . But when it comes to food they are lagging behind .. Waiting long hours for your food in table with empty stomach is just irritating. They even not care to put on butter in butter rotis .. Veg items are tasteless. Non-veg we could consider as average. Thandai is quite good ..worth a try .
4.0,Punjabi Times is a cozy rooftop restaurant in bellandur. This places ambience impresses me the most! You can find most of the authentic punjabi cuisine items in the menu and they taste all good. I had tried paneer tikka masala and cheesy chilli naan which was really good.
5.0,A refreshingly simple buffet place with great choices in the menu and very courteous staff. Food is very tasty. I've had the tastiest Chicken and Mushroom soup here. Their prawn and fish offerings are also too good.
5.0,"Excellent ambience, loved the life singer. Good service. Should try their cocktails .definitely worth a visit .don't forget to try their sarso ka saag, murg bhatinda and cheesy chilli naan."
1.0,"One of the worst experience till date in terms of food. Ordered murg galauti kabab they heated and gave the frozen packed version. Chicken gravy was tasteless and saltless. Asked for ketchup for the kids but got hot and spicy sauce , on asking again they gave the same hot n spicy sauce by adding sugar.  Decent service."
3.0,Nice place but too loud music Always overcrowded with people No offers on beer and on other drinks by the time u order the price goes up  Ok ok place
1.0,We had ordered few Prawn and chicken starters. Chicken was okay okay but Prawn was too bad to eat. I would not suggest it to any food lover.
1.0,I ordered few of the starters and biryani. I didn't like any of those. Not sure it was my bad luck to order all the items which I didn't like.
3.0,"Punjabi times is pretty easy to locate. The interiors of the restaurant is pretty neat with a few installations here and there. The staff is friendly and the service is great. The food is priced a little on the higher side, but the quantity justifies it. And the taste is fairly good. The only draw back I felt was that the place was really mind numbingly loud. They had karaoke where people came in and sang songs which was actually irritating."
2.0,"Worst hygiene, pathetic food, no tested.....no flavar.....sweet chicken and not frish.... Waste of money, only positive thing about these place is the good service and friendly staff...."
4.0,Typical Punjabi food with good taste. The parking arrangement is very good here. professional staff. We took the standard Tandoori chicken followed by rice and daal.
4.0,Many times I have visited this place. Bit pricey. Can enjoy good dinner. Railway Gobhi and bhindi kurkure are my favorite starters.Parata and veg biriyani is good here.
4.0,The food looked and tasted authentic punjabi. Good for your money's worth. Everything that we ordered was really good. The service is okay but it is manageable.
1.0,"Hygiene is worst,ordered Rajma, got insect in it. do not order from this restaurant you will get insect and Cockroach in the food, did not maintain good hygiene and don't go by its name they are not Punjabi"
4.0,Read the reviews on zomato and visited punjabi times and it was worth it..people looking for wide range of North dishes then you must try this for sure..they include both veg and non veg and must give a try for chilly chicken for sure..would rate the food 4/5 and ambience 3/5..
5.0,The staff is very cordial and kind. The food is awesome and all my family members like eating here.. Awesome food. . Good ambience. . Lovely service with the staff. . . Will definitely be back soon. . ..
5.0,"Fantastic food!!The staff was very warm and despite overflowing customers they managed to tend to each table and provide very good service. The flavors in the dish were very well brought out in both their veg and non vegetarian dishes. If you're craving good indian food, this place is a must visit...A great experience after all."
4.0,"Located in the hush hush area, its a nice place to have punjabi cuisine as far as this city goes! Also provides live music and the staff is also really helpful!"
5.0,"If you are a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian, you'll have a great time here.Never seen such good quality for vegetarians, I came here to eat chicken tikka and mutton but I really enjoyed Dalk makhni as well.  Overall, its a good place to dine in at such affordable rates in Bellandur with such great quality. Looking forward to come again !!"
4.0,"I had been here for a Team lunch. We were really skeptical about this place initially but our speculations changed after a great lunch at this place.  Buffet - 4/5 Ambiance - 4.5 Service - 3.5/5  My review is purely based on the Buffet  This place gives good quality food for both Veg and Non-Vegetarian Folks. If you are on a fast and cannot eat Non-Veg you will definitely not regret being a Veggie for the day as they have a wide variety of Veg dishes too.  There is a Chat counter, Butter Milk counter, Dessert Counter, Live Parota Counter and a Complimentary Beverage (Alcohol or Mocktail).  Makke di Roti, Sarson da Saag, Aloo Parota, Fish Fry, Dhai Puri, Crispy Baby Corn etc are some dishes I liked the most.  Place worth visiting more than once."
4.0,"Good service and good food,taste is authentic. Friendly staff. No rush in weekdays for lunch. Good room decor. Both veg and non veg buffet is good."
5.0,It impresses me a lot when authentic North Indian dishes are served at their best in a South Indian City. If you are willing to enjoy such taste and ambience this is the place you should look forward to. I came across this place when I was covering other restaurants in the same area and it was in my list since long and finally on a Sunday evening I decided to satisfy my cravings for authentic North Indian food. So let's get to the point and here we go....  Butter milk - it was fresh and spices were proper Sarson da saag - it was properly cooked and no bitterness at all Makkai roti - consistency was good Tawa paneer sizzler - it was good but not exceptional Amritsari kulcha - stuffing was ok but no salt at all.  After this what diverted my mind was the dessert section and i just wanted to try moong dal and gajar halwa both. After this what happened was unexpected. I never thought both of these dishes will be so delicious that I'll not be able to control. Funny but true!!! After that ordered gulab jamun and I must say that it was better than what the biggest sweet outlets serve. Finally ordered paan kulfi / shahi paan which was nothing but kulfi which was stuffed with paan. Something unique and never tasted before. It was so good that I wanted to take away hundreds of possible.  If we talk about the ambience it's creative and you get the feel of Punjabi culture. They have decorated the place well with the help of Bangles which was something new. They have live Retro Hindi music which you can enjoy and yes this restaurant do serve liquor which is hard to see in such theme based ones. Staff was polite and attentive. They made sure that we enjoy our dinner and have a great dining experience throughout. Keep it up guys !! You deserve a 5*.
2.0,"My God this place had a pathetic service, the food takes forever to come out of the kitchen, the staff disappears after taking the order. The only thing that came fast to my table was the bill.Coming to the food, the small Tandoori platter had 4 different types of kebab, the chicken kebabs in it were very chewy, fish kebab was dry like Thar desert and had no taste whatsoever. Mutton livery fry was good well seasoned and tender. firangi sabzi was also well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Lassi and Thandai were good. However I was told the lassi will be served in a matka, but it came in a glass. The desert came to my table 25 minutes after ordering. The Rabri was slightly sour, moong dal halwah on the other hand was good, but not worth it, specially after a wait of 25 minutes."
1.0,I ordered starter which was good n then ordered makke di roti n sarso saag which was pathetic...they served fermented one for roti n saag was too bad.N then ordered chicken curry which was again too bad to have.Finally ordered moong daal halwa n it was tasting as if guy has prepared raw moong n mixed water n boiled n served...overall it was very bad experience.Service is very slow.Overall staffs are humble.
4.0,"Ambience - The place has a true punjabi village feel to it. As soon as you enter, there is a whiff of punjabi masalas and your eyes will fall on the waiting space that has a swing kind of seating. The walls have huge dhols tugging out, there are colourful bangles used for decoration and a map of punjab made of copper looking bowls.   Location - on the service road of ORR. It is a crowded road but they do have parking so not a lot to complain.   Food - Great!  We had MURG TIKKA LABABDAAR and it was quite good.   Missi roti & multigrain roti were good and a relief from the usual naan & tandoori rotis!  Very tasty chaach as a side drink.   Service - good & prompt!   Price - pretty reasonable."
1.0,"This order is actually for a home delivery made through Zomato.. It was indeed one of the worst chicken gravy I had..after checking the ratings , I thought of ordering Lahori Murg from the restaurant..the chicken was not cooked properly and tasted raw..the gravy was a spicy tomato gravy, the recipe of which seemed like tomato salt water and red chilli powder and nothing else..N it costed almost rs350. Thanks for spoiling our dinner late night and we were not left with any option but to eat Maggie :)"
5.0,"Food quality is excellent and service also.Reasonable and affordable.Anything I have ordered from the menu in all my 4 visits, the food has been extremely tasty!I have always ended up licking my finger.Good ambiance too. A good dining place indeed."
1.0,Ordered makhnai paneer got tomato gravy with paneer dipped in it pathetic taste i highly recommend you not to order from here very disappointed...
5.0,"Excellent food , and service and great ambience !!! Food is authentic Punjab!! If you are in Bellandur should try it at least once. The service given is also appreciable."
4.0,"This is apunjabi themed restaurant situated Varthur Hobli Outer Ring Road,Bellandur. Ambience provides the feel of Punjab. We opted for buffet than Ala-carte,which includes starters,main course meal and desserts. Even though 100% authentic punjabi taste is not met, it is better compared to other restaurants who boasts about the authenticity. They provide nice valet parking facility. Staffs are courteous and service is up to the mark."
5.0,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff, and excellent service! Got a seat next to the window and had a nice view as it was on the 3rd floor. Loved the food, ambience, music, and service."
5.0,"The ambience of the place is great and the servers are extremely helpful. This place has hands down the best Makhni Dal in Bangalore, I have had so far at this price point. You can eat here without burning a hole in your pocket, have come here four times now and so far really good experiences.."
4.0,So far from home  so thought to have some northern food ..... Its too good and yummy   Love to visit again and again  Service is good  But the food was awesome
3.0,In this Area this is one of the better Punjabi places to eat. The delivery takes a long time and often there's a small item missing. Would have given 4 stars otherwise .
5.0,"Arguably one of the few places that can justify the tag of being a Punjabi place. Delicious succulent food. Flavours of biryani, butter chicken, ; authentic. Definitely going to try more on their menu. It's good to see such places when being a Punjabi place is clichd and not up to mark at all in this city."
5.0,Went here with friends. It was an awesome experience.  The ambience is also very nice.. It was just perfect and the service was also bang on. We ordered chicken tikka paneer tikka dal makhni and all the dishes were so yum. The staff was courteous and friendly. They were proactive in service and very professional. Surely recommend this place .
3.0,"We were hungry and want to have paranthas, so we went to this place. Though the paranthas were tasted like home made especially the peas and aloo. But paneer parantha was not upto the mark :-(. The starters like 'Seekh kabab' and 'chatpata paneer' were good. Next part is service. Service is quite slow. It took alot of time to get the food in our tummy. Waiters are polite though. This place is quite overprized. Overall, the experience is Ok Ok.  Ratings- Service: 3* Food:3.5* Price:3* Overall experience:3.5*"
3.0,"I visited punjabi times recently in search of awesome punjabi food and i would say my experience was mixed. We ordered pranthas and seek kababa and chatpata paneer. Everything was having a taste of home , totally home made but price was way more. Service was very slow but overall i enjoyed my food."
1.0,"Ordered Lahori chicken, seems like chef hold little more animosity towards Pakistan. Chicken was raw, gravy was watery, had weird raw capsicum pieces for no reason. I appreciate your patriotism but kindly refrain demonstrating it in your culinary skills. Tldr; Exorbitant price, bad food."
1.0,Have been there for Birthday treat (LUNCH) on 8th August . Service is pathetic. Starters were getting over and the management was just taking the situation light making patrons wait with empty plates. There were other groups complaining on food not being sufficient and served in timely manner. We were left with less choice as many had to return to office. Ambience is good ... Staff not courteous as if they were supplying food on charity. Food is ok. Will never recommend this place.
1.0,Pathetic biriyani. Red color rice with stale chicken piece
4.0,"Everything is awesome about this place. The ambience, food and the music. Ambience Remains Earthy rustic. The USP of this place for me will always be the Live Music"
4.0,"A very nice place to go for a family dinner/lunch. Perfect for the mood when you just want to have some good North Indian food. I especially like the butter chicken here. Staff is wonderful. Courteous, helpful, all you could ask for.  Thank you  Will be back soooooon"
5.0,"I had a lovely end to a beautiful weekend with dinner at Punjabi Times. The live music is so good. The decor is pleasing and inviting and the staff is very attentive. The food was good and my craving for great Punjabi cuisine was satisfied beyond my expectations. All in all, I would definitely give this place another try."
1.0,pathetic food. They don't even know what Amritsari Macchi is. Mutton dry fry comes with bones. worst kebabs I have ever had
1.0,Too bad.
1.0,I ordered 2 iteamas but delivery boy only one give lost my money 210 -/ Zomato is mistake
4.0,"Live music with old Hindi songs, make this ideal restaurant for song lovers.  Food was good, we chose wrongly some of the dish but other dish were good.  Nice ambience too.  Service was okay."
4.0,"Went here with my family on a weekday afternoon. The set up is really good. The interiors are in accordance with Punjabi theme. Absolutely loved the service. The staffs were extremely courteous and looked after us regularly. They were also dressed traditionally. Once you sit down, you will be in love with the atmosphere they create. Coming to the food, we ordered several dishes. All were superb and it is worth every penny."
1.0,"I am writing this review as I have been waiting for my food for the past 30 Mins. Heads up guys .. if you see more than 15 people in the restaurant, run away and find another place to eat."
5.0,"Authentic Punjabi cuisine with some delightful chart buster dishes on the menu. A fairly decent place with fine seating arrangement and some delicious food. Ambiance is really nice. The dishes are really authentic like butter chicken, sarso da saag and rogan gosh!  I have visited this place twice already now!"
4.0,good but needs to see
4.0,The food is decent
5.0,"If you craving some hardcore North Indian food, this is your place to be... With interiors done up so well, the dining experience is wonderful. One of the really good places in Bellandur. Also, the music is good. You definitely enjoy your meal here. Have been coming here for months and never had a bad experience. Cheers.."
1.0,Butter nann was satly and panner lahori was not has expected over all the quality has come down..

5.0,"When you crave something nice and you land here, the expectations are so high and Punjabi Times did fulfill those expectations. The food is lip smacking delicious. Good variety as well.  Kindly do visit this place for its prompt and courteous service & ofcourse for its food, you won't be disappointed. :)"
5.0,good
4.0,Awesome desi tadka to the lunch plan! This place takes you to the rich & glorious land of Punjab by its ambience and desi vibe! Even though the food doesnt have the 100% authentic punjabi cuisine flavour but its still leaves you content and is far better than a lot of restaurants promising to deliver that. They make your dining planning absolutely hassle free by providing a nice spacious valet parking facility. Complimentary beer with the buffet just sets the mood high!
5.0,"On my visit there was a singer, who had a really good voice which was such a bonus of eating here. Ambiance- 5/5, loved it.. Service - Very good polite staff. Food - no words, I have tried so many dishes and every single one of them was tasty. A real good place to find some amazing punjabi khana..."
3.0,"The name is Punjabi Times, the menu has alot of punjabi dishes. But the service is totally not. The waiters dont understand punjabi, the serving and the dinning style is not at all related to Punjab. Some of the food items are not even related to the taste of Punjabi food culture. Lets take phirni for example, it was hard to differentiate phirni and kheer while phirni is a very yummy desert in Punjab."
1.0,worst service they are not giving spoon and also zomato person talking in kanada I don't understand ...
5.0,"I suggested this place to my friends as we were meeting after a long time! That was the best decision I made that week. We came for dinner.  First thing we all liked was the ambiance. Very well done on the interiors... Secondly, the food was absolutely finger licking delicious.. I couldn't get enough of the food. We all left Punjabi Times with a big smile on our faces."
1.0,ordered sir boneless chicken received it with bone....it was very disappointing..
5.0,I went to this place on Friday as I had received a lot of positive reviews from my friends. And surely the place didn't disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious and finger licking good.. The staff is really courteous and friendly.  I would really love to visit this place again
2.0,"Really surprised that it has 3.5+ rating on Zomato. Pathetic service and tasteless food. We ordered two starters and they were decent. But extremely slow service and tasteless Dal Makhni ( one of the worst ) were enough to spoil the dinner. On top of it, given onions which were rotten. disappointed."
3.0,"You can take punjabi out of punjab, but you can't take take punjab out of punjabi.  Expats had visited our office so we decided to give an experience about punjabi culture and food.  We went Punjabi Times for team lunch. Its situated in Varthur Hobli Outer Ring Road,Bellandur and its just opposite to Citrus Hotel.  It's a punjabi themed restaurant. They have placed dummy of punjab traditional musical instruments and posted pictures of famous punjabi bollywood actors and singers.  They also places old persian old water wheel used for irrigation in Punjab. They tried their best to give visitor a glance of punjab.  We opted for buffet than Ala-carte,which includes starters,main course meal and desserts.  They have pani-puri counter and wagon for punjabi traditional food .   I had taken Panner Chatpatta Tikka, Sarsoon ka Sag, Punjabi Chole, Egg Curry and Makki Di Rotti in breads.  I was very excited for Sarsoon Ka Saag and Masala Cholle. It was not as delicious as expected.  Flavours of homemade spices were missing in taste. May be my expectation were too high but this is best you could find in Bangalore.  In deserts they served Pan Kulfi which had given relief to my tongue taste buds.  Overall, We spend good time with team.  My Rating:-   Ambience-    Taste-    Service-   Value for money-"
5.0,"Saturday evening spent well with family. Ample amount of delicious food on the table, good music in the background and good company - what more do you need?? Really good food.  Staffs are very courteous and friendly too. Would love to visit again!!"
3.0,We ordered Lahori murg and tandoori rotis. The rotis seemed hastily packed in foil. They were soft and soggy.   Lahori murg was good to taste. A red tomato based gravy with capsicums and chicken. Good portion size.
3.0,Butter Chicken quality has degraded since my first order. Earlier it used to be very creamy but this time it was more tomato gravy.
5.0,The ambience is good. Food is excellent. Staff is good and nice service. Every thing went perfect. Overall it seems to be a really nice place to have a meal with friends and family...
1.0,ordered biryani... biryani was tasteless... chicken pieces were hard.. spoiled my dinner
5.0,Punjabi Times is a complete paisa vasool place! I have come here so many times and the food has been so consistent... For vegetarians and non-vegetarians this place is a treat. I can't recommend enough. PS: try butter chicken lassi and dal makhni..
5.0,Awsome food and thr music and the ambience.... Loved the place... Want to visit once again... And try other items.. And yea the staffs are good and friendly..
1.0,Food was very blant...
1.0,One word . Terrible . Had to bin it right away . Ordered chicken biryani and chicken tikka biryani . One star is for the polite chap who took the order and delivery .
1.0,"I ordered murgh pathankot , but the taste was not at all good , such that I had to improvise it myself in order to make it tastier , I have had murg pathankot before but this time it was really really disheartening!! And the irony is I have ordered before and did like the quality before but a curry dish going bad is unacceptable , spoils the mood entirely!! We are anyways paying a comparatively higher price hoping quality but then we get disappointed like this."
4.0,Good experience. Have been there once with office colleagues. Good ambience and food. Staff is courteous. Had good time. Quantity was sufficient
5.0,"A restaurant that I have been visiting for months now.. I have always got best service and the best food ever. Waiting time is also not much. Food is served piping hot. Biryani is good. Rogan gosh is good. Butter chicken is good. Also, dal is good.  Overall i had a great time and will surely continue visiting here!"
1.0,subz amritsari was spoilt
5.0,"Amazing place.... If thinking of going out for a nice meal then Punjabi Times is the place for you!! With it's elegant ambience, Courteous staff, Delicious food . What a lovely lunch we had and thankfully no one was complaining about anything..."
3.0,"Visited this place this week for a lunch buffet.   Before going to the details, I can summarise the experience as Average.  Many of the items were served a bit cold. The spread was ok. Taste wise, the chicken wings and boneless pepper chicken were good. The fish was just fine. Many of the veg starters got over pretty fast and had to wait for a long time for them to get it filled back. Mocktails also have nothing much to talk about. The mutton curry was good. The meat was tender and well cooked. Biriyani was a disappointment.  Not many varieties for desserts. However the jamun was above average. Pastries were just fine. They also have a Chat counters, but it is also passable.  I would recommend this place if you have patience and work/stay nearby and do not want to drive. Also if it is an official team lunch as they have space for big groups.  Otherwise, we have plenty of better choices if we focus on the food and ambience aspects."
1.0,"Extremely pathetic experience I had.  After observing some 5star ratings and review thought of visiting this place for weekday lunch . We opted for buffet.  Only 4 items in Veg Starter and 3 in non-veg started.  I only found Amritsari Macchi is good among all starters and main course.   And once the tray in counter get finished, they takes around 20 mins to fill it up.  We asked for butter Nun, service guy told us that today is some problem with butter Nun equipment, donno whether they tell this everyone or only for today.  Chat counters service also pathetic. Asked for Dahi puri around 1pm it came to our table at 1.48pm.   Something more bad I cant write. For buffet only dont visit."
5.0,When looking for authenticity you should come here!! The food is just marvelous. I never knew that this place would really take me by such surprise.. Ambiance staff food service and also the rates made me a happy person. I have taken so many people till date and none of them complained. Cheers!
3.0,Really disappointed with the food here. In a Punjabi restaurant you expect some authentic dishes to be decent at least. Dont ever try shikanji and kadi pakoda here. Kadi was spoiled as well. Rest of the food we ordered was fine.
5.0,"Food is good. It is fairly simple restaurant with a homely feeling. The music is generally of old famous bollywood genre, if you are lucky there is live singing by an artist. You are allowed to make song suggestions, and mostly he does pick it up. North indian cravings quenched here!"
5.0,"Visited this place last Saturday with my family and loved the food here that is why here I am sharing my review. The hospitality was amazing too!!! The rates are fine for a place like this. I would recommend the butter chicken of this place, its one of the best."
4.0,"Starting with ambience..which is fine considering the punjabi style. But i'm not sure only I observed, there is alwaz some sort of smell in dat plc. Food is good, staff is alsp polite."
5.0,Food was really good as always!! The place undoubtedly offers the best North Indian cuisine in the town.  Butter chicken or Dal Makhni or rogan gosh or the thali - Punjabi Times has never disappointed me. The food is worth every penny. Great dining experience in all.
1.0,"An atrocious experience..can not even rate the food as below average...very disappointed as we went there after checking the rating on zomato which say 3.9.......no taste.. no flavor....i would not recommend this place to any one at all..also the quality of food was not good..a "" never forgotten"" experience :-(.. ....would have rated 0 if option given"
5.0,An array of amazing mouth watering dishes makes it a place you come back with new people every time. Such was my first experience that I brought back my friends and family too later on. The thali is such value for money and also the variety in the buffet is good. My vegetarian friends too had a good time relishing the starters and the main course. Amicable staff who are very efficient.
2.0,"Stale paneer used for the dish, dal makhni was too sweet"
5.0,The atmosphere is so nice that you'll really have a great time here with friends or family members or colleagues!! Ambiance makes it a worth while experience. I also have to say that the food is superb. 5 stars for the chefs here. We tried a lot of starters and main course and most of the dishes were delectable. Recommended!
5.0,"A totally marvelous place in Bellandur serving good north Indian food! I first got accustomed to this place thanks to my team who had arranged a team lunch here. The food was soooooo good, barely managed to get some work done after lunch. Had a fabulous time here. The staff too are so wonderful - very polite helpful and also efficient. May I mention the thali was so worth the money!"
5.0,"The name of the place and the ambiance goes hand in hand, the place is done up so well to make the customers feel like they are in Punjab! Good job on that, this outlet attracts a lot of professional crowd like me and my team, who often come here for team lunch. The thoko thali is so good and comparatively reasonable.  The food does stay in your mind and taste buds making you visit this place more often!"
1.0,"5 Naan took close to 2 hrs to deliver. The food was cold, so imagine a Naan being Cold(yes it was hard as leather). Never going to order back!"
5.0,"When you walk into Punjabi times, you get a feel of Punjab, without being in Punjab. Lunch times, evenings and occasions are crowded, so book in advance.  I have been there few times now and have never been disappointed. Overall, I liked this place for the food & service. Must Try ( especially the thali)"
5.0,"A reservation is a must especially on weekends and for dinner!! I really liked the chat counter, everything tasted nice and fresh.. Usually I see a lot of families around here but with this good food me and my team have been eating here for a while now. Nice staff, great food and economical prices.."
4.0,"This is my favorite place to come for North Indian .murgh tikka Lababdar, murgh bhatinda, roti...thinking about these dishes makes my mouth salivate... the service is good very polite and friendly Mr monoj ..would visit for dinner sometime...."
4.0,Good food
5.0,"The ambiance is good with lot of Punjabi style models and painting. You can get some feel of Punjabi with the ambiance ,!!!.  Awesome food I must say, this was the most authentic punjabi/north Indian food I ate in Bangalore. The dishes are tasty and quantity wise good enough. Try this place."
2.0,Starter and biryani was very ok..
5.0,"As their name suggests, best punjabi food in this area to have. Their live music during the evening time is really soothing to ears. Makki ki roti with sarso da saag is a must try during the seaaon."
5.0,"Any one who wants to eat north ka khana in Bangalore then this is one of the better place in Bellandur !!!!! I would definitely recommend dal makhani with butter naan (must try)!!! Buffet (thoko thali) is good and real value for money as well, come in groups to enjoy the thali!  A good value for money place."
5.0,Visited this place for a lunch with office colleagues recently. We ordered both veg and non-veg food from the A La Carte Menu. They have good options in the menu. Chicken starters were good but veg starters were better!!  One of the better restaurants in the area for good North Indian vegetarian food (though I think they are more popular for their non-vegetarian). Their starters are excellent - their chefs recommendations are always a good pick.
4.0,"This place is located on the floor below Tipsy bull opposite Citrix on the outer ring road. If you are looking for authentic Punjabi food then this is the place to be.  Once you enter the place it has very nice interiors with full punjabi theme, wheel with water at the entrance, dhol on the walls, punjabi letters written, nicely decorated wall with matkas (pots), bangles.  When you enter and sit down you will be just in love with the atmosphere here, live music being sung by one of the person and all old hindi songs. All the people serving inside were wearing kurta pajama.   Coming to the food we all were hungry so we directly ordered the main course after ordering 1 peanut masala which was nice in taste being:  1. Dal Makhani : Good but can be better, salt was less , can be improved.  2. Dum allo Masala : liked this dish, made up of small potatoes with gravy.  3. Paneer Tikka Masala : Nice taste and spicy, good one to go for.  The best part of this place is that they have just home made Aam ka achar and Sirka pyaaz (Vinegar Onion) which you hardly find in restaurants in bangalore. Presentation was also nice, the food looks good to taste and even the quantity was good.  But being a summer season and mango season they didn't have aam panna which i wanted to have. Service was a bit slow they took too long to get our food to the table otherwise its a good place to go with such nice atmosphere.                                             foodtravelpedia.wordpress.com"
2.0,Food came cold and biryani wasn't looking the way it should be however chicken was fresh
1.0,late food delivery and small quantity. will comment on taste after having it.
5.0,5 star for services. 5 star for food. 5 star for ambience. Luv this place. Ovelall experience is excellent. Music+ food+ place will take all your heart.
5.0,"Finally made it to Punjabi times with my friends. I remember mentioning this place to my friends and since then we haven't been able to dine here until a week ago when we came for lunch as we all were near Bellandur. The place wasn't that crowded so we had a good time, sitting and enjoying the thoko thali! They serve really well, well trained staff too."
1.0,"These guys are fraud. They charge more money from the customers by changing the order quantity. We ordered 4 small whiskey, instead they served us 4 large without letting us know. In the bill, they made us pay the full amount. They are cheat."
1.0,"Ordered dinner for two yesterday, paneer lahori had 5 small pieces of paneer and roughly chopped bell pepper in a sweet gravy; it took them an hour and 30 mins to deliver and we stay just 500 mtrs away from the restaurant! So if you plan on having dinner from Punjabi times tonight please order yesterday!"
3.0,"We really liked the ambience. The live music was nice. Now, only why I've given the place just 3 stars.  The table napkins given to us were smelly and wet. The food was just average. The Dal Makhani was quite terrible. The music was too loud. Loud enough to inhibit conversation."
3.0,Ambience is ok. Food is not up to the mark.. you can't get any thing spicy. Fish had a stinky smell a bit.. definitely not a place which I will visit back
2.0,The chicken doesnt seems to be fresh and not cooked properly.
5.0,"A non-vegetarian will surely love the food here! From butter chicken to mutton gosh - the food is mouth watering finger licking delicious! Good food pleases your soul, eating here definitely made my day better. Rarely I come across places where I don't waste food and this is one among them. Recommended."
5.0,"Decided to try this place out after reading all the reviews...  The ambiance is awesome! Abundant variety and most of all great service.. I have been here thrice now and the food was good all the three times. Overall, if you are looking for a good restaurant in Bellandur - punjabi times is your place."
3.0,Roti and naan were pretty cold. Paneer tikka masala was little bit sweet. Dal makhani was good
3.0,Last Friday I visited this place for team lunch. The place was ok and the starters they served was good especially fish .The main course they need to improve little bit. Overall the food was good for that price range  The disappointment was they charged 45rs/water bottle and mrp price is 19rs.
5.0,This should be your next go to place if you crave for authentic butter chicken and Dal Makhani.  The live music is also such a treat for the ears.. A great Indian Food place! Decently priced food with good ambiance and good service. Must visit this place with your parents or friends.
1.0,I have to call the hotel many times to get food delivered
5.0,People with really good appetite should come here for the lunch thali! So much varitety!!! Vegetarian or non-vegetarians there are plenty of choices for both. The ambiance is very earthy rustic type. Food takes away all the focus honestly. I actually skipped my dinner that day because I was still relishing the lunch we had here. Recommended.
3.0,"As a buffet wise there was enough items to hog.However, food quality needs to be improved! Like chicken was bit of rubbery :( Ambience was really nice ...they tried getting the punjab look and feel inside the restaurant! One quick question to the management and the rating have been reduced for the same reason - Why were we charged service charge @7.5 %? It was a buffet and moreover starters were also not served at our table! So the service charge is not justified! It was also not displayed that they charge service charge from their customers! Kindly look into this issue as this might be a hue turnoff for the customers !"
2.0,not worth the money at all
5.0,Finally sitting down and writing this review. Had been meaning to do this for few days now. Punjabi Times is a place that occasionally I pay a visit to. Have been to the other outlet as well. What I have observed is over time the quality of the food hasn't decreased and the service has always been a plus point. I like this place.
5.0,"The money you spend here is so worth it! The food definitely reminds you of the north.. Sitting in with yor loved ones , enjoying a good talk and having yummy food. Have always come here for lunch and they have never disappointed me so far.  I would give it a 5 for sure."
5.0,"Whenever I think about this restaurant only one thing comes to my mind wow, on the night of Diwali I thought to visit here with my girlfriend and the purpose of the visit was only food no alcohol or I didnt even knew that this restaurant has a spirit menu, anyhow we reached at the restaurant by 8:40 and found the place and ambiance very good, the lights were dim waiters are polite and there was no rush so we went to our table and ordered some food while enjoying the songs being sang by a person of that restaurant (his voice was awesome) after that I found the spirit menu and ordered two beers and also have a note of my favourite songs, in 2 minuets I got my beer as well as the he the singer started singing my songs, oh man it was a pleasure to listen my favourite songs live while drinking my favourite beer also in no time the food was served and has pure authentic North Indian/ Punjabi taste. Overall the experience was just awesome"
1.0,bad smell
5.0,Bangalore has a lot of amazing restaurants for sure serving different cuisines and one such definitely is Punjabi Times. One visit with the family and my family just loved the food the place and the service. The food is definitely finger licking good. I have been such a regular customer and the consistency of the food has been the same. Recommended.
2.0,Dal was good. Rotis and kulchas were horrible and completely burnt.
5.0,The food at Punjabi Times is finger licking good!! On my every visit they have surpassed my expectation. The food has been consistently good as well. Have come here for lunch and dinner - food remained excellent.   Ambiance - 4/5 Staff - 4/5 Food - 5/5 Overall - 5/5
5.0,"The food at Punjabi Times makes you happy !!! Bes to coe in group to enjoy the most, I came with my family and cousins here. We all had such a great time, the service was good too considering we were 10 people all eager to eat and enjoy the place. From chaats to starters to main course and desserts - we all loved the food."
5.0,"Surprisingly all my visits to Punjabi Time so far have been for lunch either with friends or family or with colleagues as well. Why lunch, one can't miss the thoko thali so I make sure I try to come here mostly for lunch... The spread is fabulous for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians from starters to main course and desserts, very worth the money."
3.0,roti was too hard
1.0,Very bad experience food was too bad and no verity in buffet.Nonveg food was stinking.pastries were old and bitter in taste.Ambience was also not good.
5.0,"I think all it takes for me to come back to a place is how good the first time was. My first time I came with a friend for lunch, hardly knew that thali is famous and we stuck to ala carte but the food really amazed us, like there is good food and then there is ridiculously delicious food and that's what you get. I would recommend everyone."
4.0,"Good Ambience, pretty decent food and really good desserts. Have been to this place a couple of time for lunch and both the times the food was pretty good. Have also tried the lunch thal here and it's value for money and really well made"
5.0,"I am always on the lookout for places that serve amazing butter chicken in bangalore, I have tried a lot of places and some were really good like Punjabi Times. Also, not just the food impressed me but also the ambiance and the service by the staff. I can see myself a lot actually. Next I am planning to try their thali on weekdays!!"
5.0,"Finally I got a chance to visit Punjabi Times. The place has a wonderful Decor and the Buffet spread is awesome. Adding more fun to your meal they have a live Counter & Pani Puri with Chaat Counter which u cannot afford to miss. I started with the Shorba and the Starters which were excellent and the options were amazing. Then I hit the Salads and Main course which were a must to die for. The Chicken Biryani and the Mutton Rogan Josh yummy. To end my meal with a sweet note I tried the Pastry, Kheer and Mini Jamuns with Ice cream.  service : 4.5/5 decor : 5/5 music : 4/5 food : 5/5  a place u must visit ........!"
5.0,"Punjabi Times will surely be enjoyed by non-vegetarians!!! The food is fabulous. From tikka's to kebab's and curries - purely divine!! This is a rustic place that gives a very earthy vibe. Good place to come with friends, settle down and talk and eat and laugh. Also the lassi is so good.."
3.5,"Nice Rustic Punjabi ambiance the moment you enter the place. We went there for office party of about 20 + people. The staff was very courteous. We booked buffet wherein they served on the table. I only had non veg so my review is entirely based on that. Non veg starters were average, chicken fry was oily and chicken kababs were ok in taste but very dry. Fish kabab was also very average. We ordered lassi which was very watery and was tasting more of buttermilk/chaas rather than a lassi. Now from ain course butter nan was good and mutton kosha was tasty as well. But chicken gravy was again very avrage and chewy.  Service was very slow and only plus point was the live music. Overall an ok experience not so great food"
5.0,"What a place !!! In Bellandur, this is one restaurant I have come to over and over again.. The food always makes me come back here. The music really complements the mood of the place and just sitting down with your favorite people and eating delicious - life is really good! Nothing makes me happier than good food."
4.0,Amazing food and a pretty good service. Located right across the road. One can always come here for a good serving. Cheers guys. Keep it going.
5.0,Me and my friends are huge fans of north Indian food... The name of this place is definitely appealing and so we came here to have lunch! Ambiance is so Indian and very pretty. You'll definitely enjoy a meal sitting here and eating and licking your fingers after the end of the meal. Highly recommended.
5.0,If you are looking for authentic punjabi food. This is the place. We 31 as a team went there and had a great time. Great food. Great service. Every one was appreciative of the quality of food and the ambience. In and around Bellandur try this place once.
5.0,Execellent Butter Chicken - reminded me of typical Delhi taste
5.0,Authentic punjabi food in Bangalore is what Punjabi Times offers!! You'll find this outlet buzzing with professionals and families alike. I have been here previously so can definitely vouch for the quality and the taste of the food. From ambiance to service - I can't find any fault. Always coming back for more...
5.0,kichdi was absolutely awesome...
4.0,good
2.0,"TD;LR Good place thanks to good food, ambiance and live music. Unlikely to visit thanks to the behaviour of manager Ramesh.   Positive  1. Live music 2. Good ambiance 3. Good food 4. Fairly VFM  Negatives  Behaviour of manager Ramesh. He is like a spoiled kid who refuses to listen and then shamelessly turns away when in his interest something is been said.   We had booked via dine out which entailed 10% discount on food. While we entered we showed the same to the person who was at the gate and who escorted us inside. Then when we asked for bill, Ramesh said sorry you have inform me this before and I cant give you discount. I showed the Dine Out booking and offer to the person who was working there. Should I inform each and every person working there?   Discount would have been less than 100, which is not the point, the point is the way he spoke and was not ready to listen. Dine out clearly says show the message before bill is generated, which we did.   The broader question is why did he want to know the discount beforehand? Is it to serve substandard food and less quantity to people who are coming with discounts code?   People and behaviour like these ensures customer dont return back. In hospitality industry it is the service which ultimately is the differentiating factor.   Closing words - Better to order Home a Delivery than to get a chance to interact with Ramesh."
4.0,"Good option for having team lunches. Also variety of options for family crowd as well. Non veg starters incude Chicken kabab , fish kabab and chicken wings. Veg menu incluses all sorts of paneer and corn variety and salads. Chat counter is quite good. It serves Dahi puri, dahi papadi, etc. Overall good ambience and little cost effective as compared to others."
4.0,good food
5.0,"There's just nothing you can complain about Punjabi Times. Brilliant food, nice decor, generous portion sizes, best taste!! A perfect blend of taste and wonderful experience.  Amazing mixture of very affordable and really tasty food so will definitely repeat. You will love it.."
4.0,Rustic Punjabi world in Namma Bengaluru.. if you want to have the authentic punjabi food then this is the place for you. From music - Ambiance- Food it is desi and lively. They get live singers as well . Interiors are Punjab themed as well.                                                                 instagram.com
5.0,Great food and hospitality. Loved the ambiance of this place. Come here for the thoko thali because it is so worth your money. Out of all the buffets I have been to I must say I have enjoyed this the most.  Value for money ! Keep it up! Look forward to visiting this place again.
5.0,"I truly believe there isn't any cuisine like North Indian cuisine!! The food is just wow.. The mix of spices, the taste everything is for the soul.. I have been to this outlet previously and my experience has been amazing all the times.  They do serve authentic food - non-vegetarians will love this place."
3.0,"Well this place is a 50-50 go. Good Ambience. They have their own singer who sings and majorly old songs I suppose ( not very good all the time). Food is just fine. We ordered ""rara paneer, Dal makhani, rotis, lassi, aam Panna"" and it was average. Their service is quite slow that you have to sit without the food for ages. although there is issue with the service, i do like the beverages: "" lassi and aam Panna"". Check out the pics of the only things I like there."
2.0,"The food was average, although the ambience was good. Didn't like their sabzi's, paneer was stale and other curry was bit uncooked. 2 out of 5 roties ordered were bit burnt. Lassi was good.  Overall expensive food with not so good taste but good ambience and music. They also charge 7.5% service charge which is not worth the service they provide."
5.0,The ambiance here is done so beautifully!! It gives you very welcoming feel.. Reflects a dhaba for sure.. The food too has an authentic feel to it. Also the singer who sings those bollywood songs is damn nice.. I love dining here..
1.0,Pathetic food! Repent ordering from here! No where close to good punjabi food!!!!!!!!!
3.0,Chicken was pathetic. It was chewy as if chewing rubber. Gravy was sweet. Being its punjabi restaurant how can u make gravy sweet instead of spicy
5.0,Just the aroma of the food will make you come here again and again. This is a really good place for North Indian food... After work nothing like gathering up with friends sitting down talking about our woes and enjoy good yummy hot food. Highly recommended.
1.0,Being a punjabi restaurant was having high hopes. But the food is worst than any roadside tuck shop. We ordered below veg items: lahori paneer- Tasteless (Its a liquid cream with paneer) kaju kumbh- pathetic with mushrooms uncooked Roti- dont order it by mistake also. its not roti because it is more thicker than naan. Worthless place and too costly !
3.0,the biryani was too spicy.
5.0,"Went on the occasion of women's day with team members. I feel that buffet was value for money , the spread was good. They have a wide variety of sweets in the buffet .The ambience was good."
5.0,"From sarso ka saag, baingan ka bharta to lassi and non-veg platter - the food is absolutely delicious! Nothing like listening to bollywood songs and enjoying khana with your loved ones. A good ambiance certainly adds to your experience. This is a wonderful place to enjoy good north Indian food for lunch or dinner. PS: Lassi is yumm!"
5.0,"We came to Punjabi Times to try their lunch buffet! The menu looked good and buffet is priced so reasonably and also the variety for vegetarians and non-vegetarians was good too. The aroma of the food was enough to make us more hungry. We devoured each bite. Overall, a fantastic place."
2.0,very bad taste. some chicken piece were uncooked.
5.0,"Rarely I come across a place where what ever we ordered we really liked! Came with few friends for lunch.  Nothing like catching up with friends over good food. I have been here previously and I knew the food is good. The service is good, even when full house they get the food within 25 minutes."
4.5,"The food is just slurp! I have tried so many north Indian restaurants in Bangalore and most of them were ok ok, some were good and Punjabi Times belongs to the good category. The dal makhni is so tasty - almost feel like never sharing that with anyone. Butter chicken too - but I am partial to dal makhni. One should visit this place."
1.0,"I ordered for ghost biriyani but I got chicken, very sad"
5.0,"Live hindi music in the background, pretty ambiance and delicious food! This is one place you should come when you are looking for good food around. In Bellandur, this is one of my most visited place. The food is excellent - over the months I have gone the food has been consistently good. Recommended."
3.0,Zomato tracking details weren't updated properly in the app. And never showed when dispatched from the restaurant. Also food wasn't as per their usual standard. First time ebing let down by Punjabi Times.
5.0,"The menu is what will make you come here again and again! It has everything one can crave for isn't that great. For vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike! From chicken to paneer tikka, biryani to dal makhni and sarso ka saag! They have it all. Good food and reasonable pricing."
3.0,Food was delivered almost 20 mins after promised.
3.0,"Well my friend is a huge fan of this place and she took me here for dinner on sat.Well the ambience is ok ,but the music is classic,they have a live singer who sings all the classic bollywood songs and damnn his voice is nice. Our order was served 35 min after placing the order due to the misplaced order recipt. Finally the food-Panner tikka was not good ,the marination was not done upto the mark and should be worked on.The chicken ,aloo gobi and rice were nice cause all three of them had the tandoori flavour hint in them which was delicious.The dal fry how ever had too much salt in it. Overall 2300rs for a dinner of four on Saturday is not a bad deal at all"
4.0,Dal Makhni was really good Paneer Tikka Masala was a bit tight
5.0,I think good food always makes you happier after a bad day. That's what I did - basically me and my friends did. We came to Punjabi times as we have been here previously and we had the most amazing dinner. What an end to the day. From rogan josh to tandoori chicken and lassi - it was a meal worth remembering.
4.5,"Friday's at work are usually the days we end up having lunch outside, and it's also the day when most of the office folks bunk. So last Friday it was just me and another colleague, we decided to check out Tipsy Bull as it has been quite sometime that we visited the place, while we were there the aroma of Punjabi food got us down to Punjabi Times, another establishment on the same building. It was lil late, 3:30 or so but the staff here was kind enough to accomodate us, good service there! The entire ambience is done very well, you get to see loads of Punjabi elements on the wall, roof and windows, makes you feel good in the right ways! The menu covers almost all the authentic and famous dishes plus the typical household Punjabi food options, we wanted to go for the specials and asked the staff for their recommendations - Bhaati da Murg and Aalishan Murg Tikka was suggested and we went ahead with it. We then ordered the Kingfisher Ultra while we were waiting for food to arrive, which arrived pretty quickly and one bite into the Bhatti Da murg and you'll be smitten by the aromas of coal, plus the meat was soft and succulent. The Alishan Kebab too was nice and spicy, we loved the cheese topping that made sure to balance out the spiciness! Main course was the brilliantly done Lahori Chicken that is a must order if you're here, the rich thick gravy is medium spicy and goes really well with Lachha Parathas, what a combination! Ended our eating streak with Gajar ka halwa and ice cream, overall an economical meal, along with beer and so much food the bill didn't burn a hole in our pockets. Loved our visit and am so glad it's close to my workplace as well, will be visiting Punjabi Times more often to grab a beer and try out other specialities here!                                             grubitizer.com"
4.5,"Some times I opt for vegetarian food and I was in the mood to try some Punjabi/north Indian food. One of my options was Punjabi Times, came here for lunch. Definitely found so many delicious items on the menu..  Food *5 Service*5 Ambiance*5 We will visit soon..."
5.0,"If you want to stuff yourself with authentic Punjabi food, this is the place! Great service, great food.  Staff is very courteous . They ensure that you leave the place with a big smile and heavy tummy. We had a great time. Definitely looking forward for another visit."
5.0,This is the best place if you are a punjabi food lover!! They serve best quality food and offer highest degree of customer service. Very good menu of food and also worth the money you spend...  Food - 4/5 Ambience - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5
4.0,A little better packaging
5.0,"The live music here really adds a great vibe to this place.... Also ,the food was outstanding. I did not expect to like the food so much.  I did come back again and this time with my colleagues actually. North Indian isn't excelled by all the restaurants claiming to serve north Indian food but Punjabi Times does serve yummy food."
5.0,"Every time I visit Punjabi Times I end up liking the place a little more. The food is definitely something that they excel in but also the place has been well maintained upto all the hygiene standards as well! The starters we had ordered were yum, we ordered way too many things to remember now - but definitely saying that we enjoyed the food a lot."
2.0,"Tandoori Rotis were hard. Dish was a bit sweet, pieces seemed like boiled instead of baked in tandoor. Delivery was on time.Quantity was ok. This review is was for home delivery and not for dine in"
5.0,"Great Place!!!  Excellent foods and nice ambience.   Yesterday I visited this place with two of my friends for dinner. They offered us a cozy place to sit comfortably and enjoy foods with live music. We kept odering items and all of them were too delicious, be it veg or non veg. Thandai was too refreshing. Service was quite fast and the waiters were also professional and friendly. Dishes that we ordered are Railway Chicken, Aaloo Makai Sev Di Tikki, Murg Galoti Sheekh, Chooza Shahi Kebab, Crispy Baby Corn Tilwaale and Thandai in Drinks.  Recommend this place to all."
5.0,Have come here so many times now and even the staff are familiar with me. The food has been good every time I have visited Punjabi Times. I have tried a lot from the menu and have really enjoyed the food. Good place to come with friends/family. Recommended.
5.0,This was my 8th visit to the place and as expected loved it again. Speed of service is very appreciable. Outstanding item for this time was aalo makai sew di tikki 5/5. Thandai was so good that I took 8 glasses parcels :p
4.5,"Authentic Punjabi food with a dollop of superb hospitality.  We visited this place on a quiet weekday evening hoping for some good, hot food. And boy were we in for a surprise! This place serves authentic, ghar-jaisa khana that will make u want for more.  What we liked (everything we ordered) Alu makkai Tikka(ask them for tamarind chutney if you like) Aam panna Makhanwala Paneer Baingan bharta  (the serving is easily sufficient for 3 people) The staff was wonderful, the service was prompt and bill was kind on our pockets! Overall...a lovely experience. Do take your family or relatives to this place!"
5.0,"I am always always always on the lookout for yummy north Indian food and then I tried Punjabi times. Seriously if you haven't visited this place already you most definitely should. The ambiance is good and also they have really sweet well mannered staff as well. Food, finger licking good."
5.0,"The place serves both veg and non-veg north indian cuisine.  Firstly, the staff was very polite and friendly  Secondly, the ambiance is well maintained. And what matters the most is the service and quality of food which was actually very good.  The service was prompt and the food was fresh and tasty.  Overall the service, ambience and food of this place is amazing."

5.0,"Excellent food and service. Awesome food as always! Great ambience and delicious food as well, the dal makhni is superb. Must try dal makhni and any paneer dish.  Overall, loved the menu. Will be back soon for more food..."
1.0,Too spicy and super cold
5.0,"I have dined here twice and ordered once and all the 3 times my experience has been a good one - worth recommending everyone. The place has a fairly good ambiance - can definitely come with family. Also, the prices aren't crazy. My favorite dishes so far are the butter chicken, pindi chole and rajma!"
5.0,"Punjabi times caters well to everyone's needs... I come here with my non-vegetarian friends and they all have a good time and so do I! The menu has good no of options for both, be it chicken or paneer - they taste is fabulous. Also, the staff attends to your needs well and the pricing is economical too."
5.0,"A great place to come with family or friends or even with your colleagues. Ambiance at Punjabi times is really welcoming and also the staff are amicable and polite. Coming to food, great variety in the menu for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Good place for north Indian food."
5.0,"A great place serving great punjabi food.  The staff is very co operating.   For the mains we had Dal Makhani(highly recommended), Paneer and chicken.  The dal makhni is definitely the best in Bangalore. Keep it up guys.. Will visit soon."
2.5,Been there for lunch after hearing good reviews. But its a major disappointment. We ordered Tandoori Chicken and this is the worst tandoori I ever had. Absolutely no taste at all. We didnt dare to try the main course and headed to a different place.
5.0,"North Indian cuisine is something that I can eat on a daily basis that's how much I like it. Found Punjabi Times by chance and been hooked since then .. Easy to locate, came here with colleagues for the first time. Trust me none of us could work after eating because we all were in a food coma. Amazing food."
5.0,Spot on service and excellent food. Tastefully done menu and great staff. We went for a quick lunch and it was a superb lunch indeed. The main course was really yummy... Overall a great place for Indian food...
1.0,"I have ordered thrice from this restaurant and unbelievably on all three occasions they have either missed out an item or sent wrong item. Every time I have to call Swiggy to ask for replacement or refund. I don't how this restaurant is in terms of dine-in, but their delivery is pathetic. Also some of the items I have tried such as malai paneer kofta, tandoori jumbo prawn, tawa paneer, kakori kebab are not so good. Some other punjabi restaurants such as Chalo Punjab are so so much better. Pathetic experience!"
4.5,"I love Punjabi cuisine and happened to try Punjabi Times just recently, even though Ive made several trips to the same building that houses Tipsy Bull and Glassy.  One fine day, I went with my colleagues to have lunch. We picked the big non veg kabab platter as we were 6 people. It was an assortment of several of their kababs. For mains, you shouldnt miss their makke di roti and sarson da saag. Chicken roganjosh is outstanding and pairs well with butter naan and methi kulcha. Also, if youre a vegetarian, do try their Pindi Chole and Dal Makhni, both are pretty good and go well with ghee/jeera rice. Their badam rabdi is quite delicious and so is the rice kheer.  Overall, its a very good place to have punjabi food! Im coming back for more :)                                                                 buttertheory.com"
5.0,Had a wonderful time here. The service was excellent the food was excellent. I have become a regular customer here. he food was really yummy and in good portions. Great job guys.  Will come soon again.
1.5,Food is tasty but definitely serious issues. Four of us ate this food and had discomfort in stomach within an hour. We eat descent  spicy in general. So might be quality of ingredient or reused oil. Either way it was our last order to this restaurant.
1.0,The hotel charges CGST and SGST on charges including service Tax.(beware) ..  this is the second  time I am pointing this to them..   It is assumed that people do not check their bills....   Shall soon post the copy of my bill.....
5.0,"Think of rogan gosh, butter chicken, dal makhni and one of the place that come to my mind is Punjabi Times! I absolutely love love love the food. I have gone to their other outlet as well and the food was equally good there. The authenticity definitely can be tasted in the food.. Good service as well."
5.0,This is a nice family place to eat. All food items both veg and non veg taste good. Staff are extra attentive and friendly. Awesome experience.. Must visit this place with your parents or friends.
4.0,"Visited here for dinner, view from restaurant was good, ambience was good service was also good.. Order Mutton Roganjosh which was good in quantity and quality also.."
5.0,This should be your next go to place if you crave for authentic butter chicken and Dal Makhani. The food isn't too spicy so people with different preference can still enjoy the food. The flavours are just outstanding. Staff is cool and happy to serve.
5.0,"The ambiance will surely impress you with just one visit! It was a delight!! The food was really good. The staff advised us on the best food and made the entire evening so amazing, especially the dal Makhni was yummy... I would highly recommend you to go to Punjabi Times."
1.0,"We went to this place for late dinner since it was closer to our place and that was the biggest mistake we did! The ambience is average but the washrooms!!!! Its unbelievable how the washrooms of a restaurant can be dirtier than a sulabh sauchalaya!!! There was no water in the washrooms and then they provided us with finger bowls.. While we were having food we were visited by a cockroach and we kept praying that we dont find one in our dish as well!!  Coming to the food we ordered Malai Tikka, Lahori chicken, Dal Makhni, Palak Panner and Dal Tadka.. Malai Tikka, Dal Makhni and Dal Tadka were the only eatable dishes.. Lahori chicken had so much chilli that one couldnt even take it in their mouth (and this was after we asked for recommendation for less spicy food)! So obviously we ordered for another dish which was butter chicken (thinking no1 can go wrong with that) but they proved us wrong! Butter chicken was like a sweet dish with soooo much sugar!!! And then they remade it and this time it was only tomatoes!!! Ghee rice was more like pulao with cashews and what not without any blend!!!   Last but not the least we had ordered for desserts - shahi tukda which was completely stale!!! Half a bite and we were about to puke!!!   We asked them who their cook was and they just kept staring at us!!! The staff has no clue what they are doing and even the manager does nothing!!! I felt I was robbed of 3000 bucks that I spent on that crappy food!!! While leaving, all of us kept praying we dont get food poisoning!!!"
3.5,"The atmosphere is absolutely great, you have the one guy singing great hindi old songs on karaoke and...then there is......nothing. Food is average, serving is slow, decorations are more like Rajasthani. My punjabi friend was confused, he thought we are in Rajasthani Times . We ordered Amritsari Chatapata Machi, Amritsar Kulcha, Dal Makhani, Butter Chicken and tandoori roti, masala papad, aam panna and lassi. Tandoori rotis were hard and they felt like made 2-3 hours ago. Amritsari kulchas were ok, nothing special, dal makhani was best of the rest. Nothing stood out as a dish except the masala papad which was delicious but then again it's a very simple dish. Aam panna and lassi also was not good. They have a huge variety of dishes. I think they should make the menu smaller and try to master those dishes. And give that man who sings beautiful hindi songs a raise, he is the only one who made our visit worthwhile."
3.0,"Average experience, nothing too great and nothing dull either. Food taste was average, ambience average, service average, infact everything here was just average. So if you are looking for an average experience do check this one out."

5.0,"I love relishing on good north Indian food, makes my day. I have come here previously and the food has been consistent so far. The place is really nice, the food is delicious ...

2.5,We ordered paneer kofta and rassela aloo dum. The kofta in paneer was hard like a tennis ball. It did not break with a spoon. Didnt find traces of paneer in kofta. Although the gravy was nice.
4.5,food is good and pocket-friendly.the best part is you'll always get a place there even on weekend evenings. live good old bollywood music is a BIG PLUS during weekends .an ideal place to bring familyfor nice and tasteful dinner. BTW the lassi here is a must try
5.0,Me and my friends were in the area and we were looking for a good place for lunch and this popped on zomato. We all like north Indian food so didn't think twice to come here. The ambiance has a really nice touch of punjab and the food too. We relished each bite. Would come here again.
1.0,Bad and stale food sent when ordered through zomaton.quality of food was very bad ..really hate it..i think punjabi times has given up on standards

4.5,This place is a must visit for everyone who relishes tasty and authentic punjabi food...It has a very nice ambiance ..had been there for dinner a few weeks back..a live singer entertains the diners by rendering soulful Hindi compositions..the food is  delectable and the portion size is decent too..I tried their baby corn with sesame which was nice and crispy..the dal makhani was cooked to perfection but I felt it could have been a bit more flavourful..the rice was perfect...a nice place to come for a dinner date or with your family ..highly recommend it
3.5,"Been here few days back with office colleagues for a team dinner. A nice place to enjoy North Indian dishes. The ambience was good, as well as the service. Food was good, though we were starving so didn't have much time to judge (LOL!) and didn't taste alcohol so no comments on that. Overall , a nice place to try over lunch/dinner."
5.0,"As the name suggests, this place does serve yum yum delicious Punjabi food. The ambiance too is amazing.. Nice option to dine at if you are in Bellandur. I have come here for lunch mostly and the food has been really really good. Would recommend everyone and especially to people who love Punjabi/north Indian food."
5.0,Its being fun to be visit here... My apetite for having some typical north indian food came to an end here. Came here for lunch and had a fabulous lunch.  Ambience - 4/5 Value for Money - 4/5 Presentation - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5
3.5,Normal Taste. Not bad and not out of the box! They have a good menu and taste is satisfactory. Prices slightly on the higher side.   Food-3.5/5 Service-3/5 Prices-3/5 Ambience-3.5/5
5.0,"One of best north Indian restaurant in the area ... The place is elegant and food tastes awesome. The place is hygienic and well maintained as well. Coming to food, I tried only veg dishes on my visit and most of them were really yummy. I had a great time and will definitely recommend you guys to check this one out as it will surely not disappoint you."
5.0,"How can one ever be tired of Punjabi Khana - not me for sure.. I have eaten at a lot of places in Bangalore, nothing came as authentic as Punjabi Times. The ambiance gives you the perfect feeling of dining in a dhaba in Punjab. Also, very well trained staff and delicious food. Not asking for anything more."
5.0,The ambience and the appearance of the place are good. We came for lunch and had a wonderful lunch.. It does make a good spot for team lunches as well. The food is absolutely delicious. It's amazing how they serve such wonderful food at such a reasonable price.
2.0,Sabji was really spicy and quantity is very less. Not up to pricing that is asked to pay.
2.5,Had been to this restaurant for team lunch on Wednesday. Was not crowded at all.  Ambience is some what ok ok but requires renovation badly so that it gives some good vibes  Staff is also not very active or was it because it was weekday afternoon not sure.  They should also include more options for veg n non veg both as whatever they had was not so great in taste and also not very exciting options.
4.5,One of best north indian resturent in the area. I am usually in Bellandur because of work and most of the times I end up dining here.. Have eaten here for lunch and dinner - pretty much the same experience. Staff are well versed with the place and the food - if confused ask them for suggestions. If you are a vegetarian - try Dal Makhni - best in town.
2.0,"We went to Punjabi Times hoping for decent Punjabi food, and we were left disappointed. We ordered Murgh Tikka Alishan, Veg Seekh Kabab, Paneer Tikka Masala and Dal Tadka. The only saving grace was Murgh Tikka Alishan. The biggest disappointment was Dal Tadka, which was devoid of Tadka altogether. All in all, a disappointment."
5.0,"With authentic taste of punjab this place serves the best.  Food is great. Talk about veg dishes, non veg dishes everything is great. Interior is on point. You will fall in love with it.   Everything was well prepared and in good quantities. The ambience is good and so is the staff. Keep up the good work :)"
5.0,Been there for the very first time .. My craving for having some typical north indian food came to an end here.. The food was truly awesome. Service too was actually impressive..  Ambience - 4/5 Value for Money - 4/5 Presentation - 4/5
5.0,There's nothing that Punjabi Times l can do wrong when it comes to good North Indian food.  The food was delicious and the experience was exquisite!  From dal makni to butter chicken and rogan josh - this place has it all. Quite underrated I must admit to that. Lovely place.
5.0,"Amazing food and excellent service .. It was a great experience today with my all friends, we came here for lunch and the food was mouth watering finger licking good.. I am very happy with my experience from starters to main course and desserts - it was a wonderful meal. Recommended."
5.0,The food is amazing. The ambiance definitely complements the food.. Well maintained place as well. I have come here only for lunch so far and had a great time always. Very efficient staff with good behaviour. Would definitely visit again to this place to try out more dishes!
4.5,"Authentic, delicious North Indian cuisine with friendly service. If you are in the area and want a nice sit-down restaurant where you can enjoy the ambiance and delicious food, this is your spot.. The dal makhani is great, butter chicken is great too. Definitely will recommend it!"
5.0,"Visited this place a couple of weeks ago,... This restaurant ambience is very good... Amazing food, vegetarian as well as non vegetarian (specially chicken). Will recommend everyone to go... Felt nice to have good food and quality time with my family.."
5.0,"Before you even taste the food, the menu will make you salivate - they have some incredible options for vegetarians and non-vegetarians ... I love coming here for lunch - like just come here and gorge on yummy hot delicious north Indian food. Ambiance is warm and welcoming and they have a very courteous staff too. Recommended."
1.0,"In short: This place is an insult to Punjabi food.  We were 13 people for lunch(buffet) on a Wednesday afternoon at around 1.45pm.  The food which was mediocre or perhaps bad was almost depleting and they did not have anything to replenish. The worst sufferers were the vegetarians in the team as they literally had no starters and they had to settle for chats.  Let alone the food, they were so untrained that they would not arrange for plates, bowls and spoons. Everytime somebody went to the counter, they had to ask for plate, bowls and spoons and to my horror they would always bring only one set of it.  What kind of a Punjabi food place cannot replenish lassi or jaljeera. Even after asking repeatedly, they weren't able to do it. There were only two deserts -gulab jamun and gajar halwa which also had to be shared among team members as there wasn't enough of it. The drinks were all bland. Buckle up your shoes Punjabi Times, maybe you were good earlier but now yiur service and taste is terrible.   Overall, this place should be avoided as there are much better places both in terms of food and service."
5.0,"I have nothing to complain about this place. Great food, good service, and top notch ambience!  Authentic north Indian taste. Must try are the Dal makhani!!! The best I have had in Bangalore so far..   Very catchy options in Both Veg & N Veg Section. Must visit place in Bellandur!"
4.5,"This is my favorite place to come to for North Indian cuisine.  Rogan gosh, butter chicken, dal makhni - thinking about these dishes makes my mouth salivate.. The service is fairly good - very polite and professional staff. Would visit for dinner sometime...."
5.0,"The ambience is fine and so is the staff. With authentic taste of punjab this place serves the best... Food is great. Talk about veg dishes, non veg dishes everything is great. Also pricing is good too. keep it up guys!!!"
1.0,Such a waste.. none of us like the food..spoons are not even cleaned properly..seems like they just deep the used spoons in water and give it to other customers to use..so pathetic.. bira 330ml beer MRP written in the bottle Rs. 100 but they charged Rs. 225+gst+service tax..never ever going to this worst place to have food again..not at all recommended. Dont waste your money by going to this place. Bill attached for your reference.
4.5,Great food and fabulous service.... Visited this place for lunch while roaming around Bellandur. Opted to go for the lunch buffet. Good buffet spread with different varieties. The staff was really friendly and humble while serving.  Value for money deal. Do try it.
5.0,Came here for dinner with few friends as most of us were craving some hot yummy north Indian food. Nothing like biting into chicken and relishing it. We ordered mostly chicken items and boy that was one good dinner. Must visit this place with your parents or friends.
5.0,"Great place to go with Family. Very humble and responsive staff.. The staff was highly trained and professional which add more taste to food... Ordered Dal Makhani, Paneer Makhani with salad, curd and Tandoori Roti.. Everything tasted awesome... A must visit for food lovers.."
4.5,A sudden unplanned lunch with friends made us come here and we had a fabulous time.. The food is great!!! The ambiance is to replicate the feeling of punjab - so job well done. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.
1.5,Punjabi times is a good restaurant. We like it and have been here on multiple occasions...but were disappointed with our latest visit. I had to return our food twice as it was not hot and it was not surprising to see that we were the only guests there and that too on a Sunday afternoon. Punjabi times need to pull up their socks big time.
4.5,The place is well done with fine interiors and I specially loved the typical punjabi feeling to the place.. One of the good Indian places in Bellandur. Authentic North Indian food served with a great blend of flavours.. Exceptionally great experience...
4.0,"Give it a try!!  Been there last weekend. This place serves some undoubtedly mouth watering Tandoors. I tried to order most of the famous & signature dishes & have come to a conclusion.  Taste - 4/5 Ambience - 4.5/10 ( I loved it ) Service - 3.5/5 Value for Money - 3/5 ( a little expensive wrt the quantity )  Must have - The Big Giant ""Lassi"" (worth its price & served in a unique glass) & Bhatti da murg. Happy Eating :)"
5.0,"Don't you think of eating those delicious pieces of chicken tikka or butter chicken and devouring them soon. I love love punjabi food, this one is so close to my work place, I have become a regular here. Very polite and attentive staff as well."
2.5,Not happy with the food and taste...  Soup was not up to the mark...  Menu list was huge but taste wise it was not....  Good customer service. They have song on request its very good and enjoyable....  Need to improve in the environment...
3.0,"I am decreasing my ratings after recent experience.with high expectations after reading reviews of some prominent reviewers we ordered makki di roti and sarso da saag,both were pathetic sarso saag was still edible but makki ki roti was such a dhabba to punjabi makki di roti ,such high price for an undercooked makki ka paratha I repeat paratha not roti, flavour of ajwain was overpowering.paneer tikka another signature recipe of punjab was also average and we waited half an hour for that.only relief for the day was sweet lassi.  Last exp. Some of us saw a never before rain in Bengaluru this year,so on my birthday instead of going far and stuck into rain we decided to try this restaurant which is nearly 500 mtr away from my home. At the time we reach there it was almost empty.Monday blues! Ambience was totally inspired by villages of Punjab.great use of bangles. We don't have a large appetite so mostly we go for main course straight otherwise we end up wasting food which I personally hate. So after having fresh lime soda we opted for dal makhni,paneer tikka masala , garlic naan and Amritsari kulcha.food was great both in terms of quantity and quality.we don't get to see that much quantity of Curries now a days.after having naan and kulcha, a good quantity of Curries were still left and we were still little hungry left so we thought of ordering phulka as it is usually light.to our surprise phulka were costlier than naan and were dry(no ghee).could not eat. They levy 10 % service charge which is kinda illegal ofcourse we gonna pay tip but that will be according to our experience there.Imposing service charge is totally unacceptable. Will order at home again from them as there food tasted great and I won't have to pay service charge forcefully."
3.0,Average food among the numerous punjabi food restaurant opened up in bangalore. No noticeable items in the menu with regular saal makhani and butter chicken topping the menu.  The ambience is good and service is good too. Fairly priced. An easy going punjabi food restaurant.
4.5,"Been there for the very first time  My craving for having some typical north Indian food came to an end with Punjabi Times.. Food was finger licking good.  Service was also impressive... Recommended for a comfortable, tasteful, and reasonably priced meal."
4.5,"Went to Punjabi Times for dinner.  Super courteous staff, good hospitality! The was a lot of variety of food from Veg to Non veg which is great.. Daal Makhni was love! Overall experience was good."
4.5,Great place to go with Family. Yummyyyy this is what you too will say for sure after the food. Visited there last month for dinner. The staff was highly trained and professional which add more taste to food. Very satisfied again with the service and taste.
5.0,"North Indian food is life! Like if anyone asks me what is my favorite cuisine I will say north Indian food. The parathas, butter chicken, dal makhni - my mouth melts. This is one good outlet in Bellandur and I have come here multiple times.. The food is great, really good service and also warm ambiance. Loved it here, coming again soon."
5.0,"I have always thought of walking into this place but never got a chance!! Last weekend, got the opportunity to visit with a friend. The staff was welcoming and guided us to a table.  Perfect to come with families too.. This place is a must visit place if you are a North Indian food lover."
1.5,Very bad food and the service is even worse. We ordered chicken biryani and railway murg. Biriyani was just bland and railway murg was not properly cooked and I could taste just too much flour in it. The only good thing there was the live music.
5.0,"Visited this place for lunch while roaming around in Bellandur! Excellent food! Excellent service! Thanks for your hospitality! Amazing restaurant, great food - so much variety. We will come soon!!"
1.0,"Picked up tandoori chicken n another chicken gravy at 7.30pm Friday 17th 2017. The chicken pieces in gravy were cold at innermost layer. When I raised complaint, I received apology..so the management agrees with the practice, silently though"
5.0,"The first thing you notice about the restaurant the moment you enter is the wonderful space and ambience, it's a very invitingly warm place. The service was very courteous and well spoken staff. Delicious food, did justice to the price! Now we must visit this place again and again!!!"
5.0,"It was my 4th visit to this place. This is an awesome place I always prefer to go. Excellent ambience and food.  Very courteous staff, knowledgeable waiter. The food is very very delicious.. Very good North Indian food, you can find in Bellandur!"
5.0,Nice service. Ambience is good.  Service 5/5 Food 5/5 Ambience 5/5 Highly recommended. Will definitely visit again. Thank you for an over whelming experience
4.5,Enjoyed a Sunday lunch with family at Punjabi Times!!  Overall: Ambiance : 5/5 Service : 5/5 Food : 5/5 Beverages : 5/5  Overall had a wonderful lunch!
4.5,Had a lovely meal on a rainy day at Punjabi Times!!  We ordered the starters and some main course dishes and we loved it. Prices are also good and portion sizes are filling. Good food and value for money.
5.0,"Another visit and another fabulous experience! Being a weekend eve the retaurant was crowded, ensure to reserve a table like I did. The ambience is cosy and social.  Ambience - 5/5 Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 So, if you are a BIGGG FAN of Indian Cuisine...THIS IS THE PLACE for you! Go Figure!"
5.0,"Had been here for dinner on my friends birthday and the place is too good. Seating arrangement done well.  Food was amazing.  Be it vegetarian dishes or non-veg ones, we all thoroughly enjoyed the food.. Really the food was up to expectations , the place and its ambience was nice.."
3.5,"I have been twice, its a mediocre restaurant.  I had more expectations honestly.  It's great for team lunch or dinner,  they offer a great variety of food."
2.0,"We were here for team lunch on both occasions. Quality of food was not that great for the price offered though they had enough options in the buffet menu. Ambiance is decent and background music was good. Now coming to most important aspect for anyone who is food/hospitality/service industry. - Service: I had a very nasty experience on both occasion. Despite giving pointed feedback about the service the first time nothing has changed. Second time the manger was very arrogant in way suggesting that we are like this, if you want you can come. We are not interested to take feedback and improve attitude by the entire staff. Advice to the Mangement/Owners please train staff to respect the customers. And I am not sure how seriously will this review be taken and followed up to improve."
3.5,We went for a team lunch here. The buffet was elaborate and had many veg options too. Mutton rogan josh was  very commendable. You get complimentary mocktails and rotis and butter nans if asked which is part of the buffet  It has good fun ambiance. Good for chilling out with teammates and clients.
3.0,"The lunch buffet had a decent amount of variety. The starters were great so as the chat corner. The mutton curry tasted weird as if the mutton was old. The hygiene was a question since we saw a cockroach near the buffet place. The food didnt taste any better than a cafeteria food. The mocktail was only a fruit syrup with lots of sugar. The dessert was not bad. Overall the spread was good, the ambience was good too, the food could have tasted better."
1.0,Had a very bad experience from this restaurant on online order. Their website says delivery time of 60 minutes. I ended up getting food after 2 hours of ordering after calling the restaurant many times. Finally got the food which was very cold and not eatable.
4.5,A sudden plan for dinner and we landed up in this restaurant.  The moment you enter in here you are feeling relaxed. The orchestra being played plays old hindi songs which really makes your day. The food service is little bit slow but the food is tasty which kinda moves your attention from it. The part of this place which i personally liked is the choice of the hindi songs they do to play. Great place to dine
1.5,"Only Music was good. Ohh sorry mango pickle also tasted good as-well. Had great expectation as the name suggested.Punjabi Times, lassi was the worst we just had a sip n returned. Sarso da saag was also not so good. BY THE WAY SINGER WAS GOOD MAST OLD SONGS."
1.0,Highly recommended not to go!!We went for team dinner there. Poor service. Food is normal. Songs are boring.So I would suggest not to waste your money here.
2.0,"Punjabi for name sake.... Udaasi gaane(non Punjabi).. below average food.... If you are looking for authentic Punjabi place, this one is not the best choice...."
4.0,Went for dinner with friends.Superb ambience colourful interiors.What I liked the most is the live singer who sings soulful Hindi gaane on public demand.Food was very tasty.Paneer was so soft and gravy was delicious.Even starters were lovely.Only issue is service is a bit slow.
4.0,"Ambience is beautiful! What adds to the place is the live singing as well aa songs on request. You can lose yourself to some amazing songs from the yesteryears! Food is decent quality. Their lassi in particular, is yummm!"
3.5,"We went there for Lunch with colleagues, though we went by walk, parking may be challenge here. As name suggests theme is rustic Punjabi  but not dhabha . Decor is average rustic look of any Punjab side hotel with Rahat ( to take water from well in olden days) welcoming on entrance , you would be welcomed with Lassi or Jaljeera. During this time they have complimentary mocktails also. Chaat counter serves paadi chaat , pani puri and Dahi bhalla. Veg and Non veg have 2-2 starters eac , Starters are good and well prepared both veg and non-veg specially Tava Fish, Another must try on is Makke ki roti and Sarson ka saag which tasted authentic in taste,live tava counte has Aaloo paratha and chan masala, which were also good. Main course is below average for both Veg and NonVeg both. Desserts have options of Custard Phirani , Gulab jamoon and Gajar Halwa. You must try here Makke ki roti and Sarason ka saag , in desserts Gajar ka Halwa."
3.0,"Overrated place ...Food is OK. Not that much good.tried buffet ..But no. of chaat items were less desserts also not so yumm...Punjabi counter is worth to try... In Starters ,u will get only potato"
1.0,this time ordered from home look what I got(pls check the picture) I suggest not to order from home... bcoz we can't do anything once it is delivered.
2.5,"It was a Sunday afternoon I decided to visit this place for a nice non-veg food time. It was on the card for a long time as I have seen it many a times when roaming around Sarjapur. Expecting to be relatively empty and so it was, me and my wife were nicely greeted by reception. Thereafter the experience was ever down falling. We started off with Murg Tikka Alishaan as starters and hoped for the yumminess as I had tried that dish before and wanted to see how well can it get with a Punjabi restaurant. However, it turned out to be just tandoors - very loosely cooked and cheese bits just sitting around on top of it. It seems the chef was in a hurry to cook the tandoors and not even aesthetically served the dish. We were very disappointed by it and moved onto next in the order that being Murg Pathankot and Crispy Egg paratha. We thought Murg Pathankot being Chef recommended would definitely elevate our taste buds but alas it served to be very simple and prepared without any enthusiasm. Egg paratha too turned out to be a normal cold paratha just topped with egg layers on top. Murg Pathankot had semi cooked chicken with egg and cheese just layered around. Very disappointing with they way even the waiters were serving. Very cold hospitality and we had to ask for service even for water refilling every now and then. On a Sunday afternoon, with hardly 10 people around, I was very taken back the way the entire experience turned out to be. Wondering how can they serve during peak !  I am looking forward for a better experience next time!  Food: 2 Star/5 Ambience: 3.5 Stars Hospitality : 2.5/5 Stars Price: 3.5 Stars  Happy Fooding !!"
4.0,"Had been to this place recently and I chose to try their buffet. The interiors of the restaurant is quite good. I just loved the vegetarian starters but was a little disappointed with the non-vegetarian ones, which were a little under-cooked. The main course was average. They have live chat and roti counters which were good. The desert section was good. The meal ended with pan kulfi, which tasted great. Overall the experience was good."
1.0,"Got food delivered ""bada thandori platter"". The food was delivered on time and hot. But the quantity was very less compared to the price. Never ordering again."
4.0,"Went there on very late on a weekday (reached around 10.45 or so) and was extremely hungry.. once we placed our order the service was extremely quick. Coming to food - we ordered Dandi kebab for starters, dal makhani & paneer Burji for main course and jaljera, lime soda  Dal makhani was extremely good, one of the best I have ever had. I also liked starter and drinks. The only disappointment was paneer Burji, which tasted like undercooked.  Having said that .. all in all a good experience in terms of food and staff courtesy."
4.0,"Food, ambience, and service were all very good. Definitely recommend it. Seat near the window allowed a good view. Did not try the deserts though."
3.5,Came to Punjabi Times during an office outing. The starters were fantastic but I feel they could improve on the variety of the main course that they have. The ambience is good and the service was excellent.
3.5,"Visited this spot for a Friday team lunch. So for thevegbuffet, they offered a good range of salads and starters but the main course was basic including a paneer and mixed veg dishes.The amritsari chole and makke ki roti with sarsosaag arethe main highlights. I liked the varied range of starters for non-veg especially the BreadcrumbFish.The Mutton Rogan Josh and ChickenBiryani is a must try. The tasteis authenticPunjabi. The sweet dishes are mediocre you can still have a value for money buffet here if you are craving for a North Indian taste.Ambience-3/5 Service   -3/5 Cost     -4/5 Food    -3.5/5"
3.0,Food is Ok but not that good. Ambience of the restaurant is really good. Food is little costly. Overall would suggest it for those who likes less spicy food.
1.0,Pretty bad food and horrible ambience. The food we ordered was very bland.. the atmosphere and food is not worth the money. There are non Punjabi restaurants which serve much tastier Punjabi food nearby
1.0,"Apart from gajar ka halwa, gulab jamun n ice cream, nothing was good. Waste of money. Never recommended. No more words to comment on this restaurant, thats it."
3.5,Home delivery services are very bad but food is of reasonable quality. It took more than 1 hour to deliver for a distance of nearly 4 km. They should really improve their delivery service.
1.0,"Staff is way too rude, makes you feel almost unwanted. Food is below average.  Also, I was unfortunate to go when they were playing live music. I would say it was 'annoying' to put it mildly."
3.5,"People who love live music , this is one of the places you must visit. I personally being a fan of music, I loved the place. Old Bollywood songs and chatting with friends , best combination. The service is fast and food was good. We tried the Punjabi times chef special for starters and was good. The food isn't much spicy and quantity of food is good. Not much different from other North Indian restaurants. So if you want to have a good time with friends on Friday night near to Bellandur, you can surely prefer this place. You wouldn't have to wait for a table atleast"
4.5,A good place for an occasional dinner . Great ambience and spacious . Decent food quality . A little expensive though but once in a while it's fine.
2.0,"I had a bad experience at this place. I went into this place at around 9PM. Everyone was in a hurry, restaurant closing time was 11PM. I was about to order the starters and the guy told me that please order dinner as well as we are nearing the closing time(around 2 hours left). I ordered butter roti, daal makhni and Panner Tikka Masala. Paneer Tikka Masala was amazing. Roti came without butter which was again disappointing. Daal Makhani was without salt. Again everyone one seems to be in a real hurry. I was about to order something in sweet but dropped the plan."
2.0,"We order once in a while from this restaurant, but sadly the quality has been going down. Today we ordered butter chicken (it's called chicken makhanwaala in their menu, I guess(, chicken biryani and tawa fry mutton. We repented our decision throughout the dinner. Food was bland, no taste. Mutton is little difficult to cook properly by majority of the restaurant, so I will not go too harsh on that. But, chicken biryani quality was simply pathetic. Two dry pieces thrown in rice! Butter chicken was just about ok. Most likely not going to order again."
2.5,"After good experience a couple of times in the past, the last one was pretty poor. Being the day off for the singer, the staff decided to blast loud music and chose to not lower volume even after 3 requests. The food was mixed, a couple of good dishes but terribly bitter Dum Aloo (!!)."
2.0,The tandoori roti and naan's were cold and hard.  The pulao was very much oily and the paneer kofta was too sweet... We are ordering from this place consecutively for 4-5 days but this was the worst experience
3.5,"Visited on a Sunday for lunch with friends.Very much spacious place. Ambience is quite tacky. But the food was super awesome. We ordered 3-4 varieties of starters all were good except the fish. We ordered Lahori chicken, Methi, palak chicken curry, Amritsari chicken Bhatti on the main course. The chicken items on the main course were really really good, and a must have if you are planning to visit this place. The price was much pocket-friendly and definitely a very nice option for a casual lunch/dinner.  Ambience - 3/5 Price - 3.8/5 Food - 4/5 Service - 3.4/5"
3.0,"I order quite frequently from this place and they've never disappointed me, for taste or time! But yeterday i ordered 6 starters (4veg and 2non veg) and they took longer than usual to deliver and also the railway gobhi and railway chichken were not good. The food had also gone a bit cold and i had to be re heated."
5.0,"Not all places serve delicious food like Punjabi Times!!! The first time I came here with my colleagues, been hooked since then. The service is good and fast and the food is finger licking delicious. Amazing place !!!"
5.0,"I have mostly come here than their other outlet, this place in Bellandur has the most amazing Punjabi khana you can find. I totally adore the ambiance, replicated to make you feel like you are in Punjab. The staff are cordial and food is served quickly, amazing veg and non-veg dishes.."
5.0,"It is very obvious from the name of the place that they serve Punjabi/North Indian food! If in the vicinity and searching for places then you can definitely eat here. The ambiance is good, hospitality is good! Prompt service and also the food is finger licking good..."
4.0,"It was a team lunch on Thursday with 9 of us including our trainer who is from USA and started liking Naan a lot. This lunch was our hospitality that will be a good memory When he thinks of India. Hmmm too much story....Don't mind  ------Food------ 4  We ordered a lot of veg and nonveg items such as  Paneer tikka masala, Mutter paneer, Dhingri mutter, Punjabi murg curry, Lahori murg. All were tasty. From Indian bread, we ordered Naan and butter naan. Naan was little thik but good in taste. At last we were served with Mango Shake, Mango lassi, sweet lassi and water melon juice.  Mango lassi is a must try beverage. ------Ambience----- 4.5  I liked the place. It has nice pictures with Punjabi writings all over the wall. It has decorations with Punjabi village touch, specially the ancient crop watering tool.   -----Service----- 4  Service was as usually and good.  -----Value for Money----- 3.5  I find this restaurant costlier than others in same category.   I recommend all food lovers to try out Punjabi Times for a different and good experience."

5.0,The best service... Tasty food.. Punjabi Times truly lives up to its name! They offered great taste coupled with awesome service.  Would love to visit again and again !!!
3.0,"A cozy place tucked away on the top floor of a bustling building. The ambiance was pretty normal and the food average. The non-veg dishes rarely make the cut and the veg satisfies most of the palates. The music could be much much better even though you can request your song, the list is pretty limited."
5.0,Visited this place for lunch with my colleagues. The ambience is serene and calm!! Really good food and reasonably priced makes the visit worthwhile.  Me and my colleagues had a good time - lunch was good did not feel like working after that.. Must try..

Ambiance, Service and food are all of top quality in this restaurant.  Great in taste and sufficient quantity was served. Overall experience was good!!!"
3.5,Good food! Have been to this place twice with office colleague and liked the food. The staffs are courteous and well behaved.  Tandoori and tikkas are just awesome. Worth mentioning the all time dal makhani was also very tasty. However the biriyani were not upto the mark but I still give it to them because it's a Punjabi food joint.  Overall 3.5/5
5.0,"Was a friend's idea to go this place, and yes I don't regret it was good experience overall.  Nice place, good ambiance, staff are friendly!! The lunch buffet is good in terms of food quality and pricing.. Recommended.."
5.0,This place is great for punjabi food its calm the favorite part is there is live music. It's good place for a weekend family dine. Had been here with brother ordered lahori chicken some breads and beer and lassi we liked it hoping to visit again
5.0,Punjabi Times had been on the bucket list  for a while now.  So apart from a wonderful ambience the food is great..! We opted for ala carte and the food was delicious especially paneer items and also the waiting time was less. I would recommend this place to everyone.
1.0,"If i could give it a 0.5 rating I would.I ordered home delivery for dinner and ordered a host of chicken and Veg dishes. The food was extremely average to the point where it was unsatisfying. The flavors were off and the Naans looked like they were cooked yesterday and just heated up before sending them.My major issue is that I ordered a Paneer Sizzler and in turn got a Paneer gravy. After making two calls and getting a re-affirmation both times that i'd get a call back immediately, no call was received.On the third call it was sorted that, they would send the correct dish and take back the untouched Paneer Gravy. An hour and half later im still waiting for my paneer sizzler when it was promised in a quick 20 minutes. The service is truly horrible! Accompanied by extremely mediocre food, i HIGHLY recommend you set your sights somewhere else for dinner."
5.0,"Anyone who asks me about a good restaurant in Bellandur, this is the place I suggest everyone. Located on the main road, easy to spot ... I have come here numerous times and love the place. The food has been consistent throughout. Great food at reasonable prices..."

5.0,"The food is delicious.. Punjabi Times will satiate all your cravings for north Indian food in Bangalore, I have come here with my colleagues and friends and family and all loved the place. I would suggest to opt for their lunch buffet - really good variety and price point is great too.. Every foodie should try this place.."
3.5,"Buffet lunch. Value for money. I liked almost everything but the ones I remember ..Chicken tandoori, fish tawa, hara Bhara kebab, chats, baby corn crisps. Later it was a sleepy afternoon at work. It's a sign everyone loved it. Keep it up."
3.0,"Nothing as such worth mentioning about the experience at Punjabi times. On top of that they played very loud music, which worked negatively on the overall experience. Nonetheless I have to mention the live music was great, the singer almost sang every possible song I know of 1970-80 from Bollywood. The ambience is good, towards bit louder side. The list of dishes is long in each section but, most of what we ordered lacked any great taste. The punjabi version of biriyani was miserable. Service was fine apart from the minor distractions they had due to ipl, which was bit natural :p, isn't it!"
5.0,"This is one of those places where I love to go when I crave for authentic north Indian food... It has consistency in taste and service... I use to work near Bellandur and this has been my go to place since then, I love the lunch buffet, economically prices and tasty food. Keep up the good work........."
1.5,"I did not like the taste at all, specially in the non veg section.  Also, the service could have been better and Manager should try to empathize with customer rather than getting into an argument."
5.0,"Punjabi Times is a place you can visit when you're in the mood for a homely dinner/lunch with friends. Quality of the food is good and also the buffet here is so much better than other places. Hope they open more branches. Overall, a good restaurant !"

4.0,This place serves authentic punjabi food. I ordered Railway murg in starters which took a little bit of time to be served on my plate but worth the wait.. In main course ordered butter naan & chicken pathankot (which was yummy). Lassi was sinfully awesome. Lassi served in earthen mug. And yes if you are inclined towards puraane gaane which they played very loud may be because of weekend .
5.0,"I had heard a lot about this restaurant. This place serves some of the best north Indian food I've had in Bangalore by far.  There was a good variety in of items in the menu, good place for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians... A place which can be tried out many times!!!"

But if you looking for a place where food is not bad, service is prompt and is easy on the wallet- you cannot go wrong with Punjabi Times."
3.5,"Visited on a Sunday eveng for dinner with a Punjabi cuisine lover frnd, ambience was quiet happening but songs they were playing was of old 70's collection.wish they could have played Punjabi tracks for a proper Punjabi feeling.

The live counter, the starters, the main course and especially the desserts are really a treat. A must go for foodies.."
3.5,Was here for dinner with a friend. The place is nice but slightly claustrophobic with really dim lights. There's live hindi music which is nice.  This is really the kinda place you'd go with the family. We only had starters here which were decent. Nothing exceptional.
1.0,Most over rated restaurant had to wait for long to get orders served and food was just avg and check this pic outside for service tax notice.
5.0,"We found quality and taste of food to be fairly good. Service also was up to the mark!! There is an interesting variety of chicken dishes that can be ordered.

5.0,"Being a true blue non-vegetarian, I rarely order veg starters. Due to circumstances, I did and was pleasantly surprised to find that the veg starter tasted much better than the non-veg one. Home style punjabi food. Good ambience, good service."
1.0,"Do them a favor and do not order any delivery, they are just not capable of doing a good job there. This is my second bad experience with Zomato and Punjabi times. The food was delivered 2hours after placing the order and when it arrived they had mixed it up with another one. When it finally arrived food was cold and rotis were useless."
4.0,On this very special day i went to this restaurant with my love one   it was quite good  .   Starting from the time I entered and till I left.  I don't like soup an all so didn't experiment.  Orderd nice veg kabab with lassi which is stood out  Then main course I had mix veg keema sabzi with garlic naan   .  The combination was Bang on.   Ended with jeera rice with dal.   Wonderful experience it was   Thank you guys.  The live performance of some old songs was perfect though I don't like much but he nailed it.  Will come back again sure  Thanks for the lovely rose by d way  Food 4 Service 4.5 Ambience 5 Vfm 5 Thank again for making my evening wonderful.

4.5,"Alcohol - Check Big place - Check AC - Check Good, proper, textbook, Punjabi cuisine - Check Live playback singer (old Bollywood, weekends) - Check Decent Lighting - Check Clean Washroom - Check"
4.5,"I have been here 4 times, gets 5/5 for creative ambiance!! Veg food was good. Non-veg dishes were even better! They do make amazing authentic Punjabi food, I cant emphasize how amazing the food is here! The signature makke ki roti and sarso da saag or dal makhni or any chicken dishes will put most of the restaurants to shame...."
2.0,Maha bakwaas place..lunch buffet was too bad. Food was not at all good. Ambiance was also bad. Waste of money. Buffet spread was not good. Very few items especially for vegetarians.
5.0,"I think last week was my 7th visit to Punjabi Times... You know those days when you just want a familiar ambiance which lights up your mood instantly surrounded good music sang by a lovely singer and mostly amazing food - I come to Punjabi Times!

5.0,Completely unknown about the buffet came here for lunch with 3 of my colleagues. I was super impressed with the quality of the food and also the variety. All the dishes were delicious and hot. Everything tasted fresh and reminded me of the food I had in dhaba's! Already contemplating on visiting this place soon......
4.0,Have been here many times for team lunch.. the best thing is fish pakoda.. have become a fan of fish pakoda.. ambience is great staffs are great.. had tried buffet and prices are nominal
5.0,"You know I really wish they introduce dinner buffet as well! I always come here for the lunch buffet but sadly for dinner it is just ala carte.. Not only the buffet has really good variety but also the price is worth it!!! They have a good choice of starters, main course and desserts..  The quality and quantity of the food is good and so is the service.."
5.0,"When they serve hot hot roti's with butter and the smell of the gravy makes your mouth water the moment they place it on the table is the experience you will have at Punjabi Times. Just thinking makes me salivate, eating here is really comforting, food can comfort you and really really good food can make you happy. Dal Makhni with hot butter naan is my perfect go to meal here.."
1.0,"I also wish the rating should be lower than one!  For me the first impression that staff including manager is quite manipulative in nature! Waiting time was too long! on top of that when food came it was not at all really tasty comparing to its high rating! that make me doubt the existing score!  We ordered both veg platters Dalkhichidi, Dal makhani Allo Paratha, Paneer Parathas.  Paneer was not soft at all. Dal Mkhanai was without any taste as if they are going to serve to patients in hopsitals!!  We requested for some slices of lemon, which almost came almost when we finish all the food! Hotel manager was quite indifferent towards the waiting period and fate of the customers!  When bill came, you shall be happy to see all three component of taxes i.e. VAT, Service Tax and service charge in the bill. I must appreciate their service in bringing the bill at the end!  Certainly to the very high price that you pay, any other restaurant shall be offering you better taste that this one!"
4.5,"When you are hungry this is where you want to head! The lunch buffet will tempt any foodie like me and all these companies are so lucky to have a good restaurant near by.. Came here with my extended family, all were happy with the food and the service was also good.  They took really good care of us.."
1.0,"Very poor service and hopeless n pathetic food. Paneer was like rubber, not soft. They misguided a lot in ac. Attitude of staff were of cheating nature. Manager was not paying attention to customers  calls.  Taste is not worth of its price at all!"
1.0,Very average food. Ordered Paneer Tikka Masala with specific instructions to make it spicy but it was sweet and tandoori roti was so thick that I couldn't eat. Last order from my end.

4.5,"I am a huge fan of Punjabi Times, anybody who knows me knows that I love eating here!! No words for ambiance just WOW!! The weekday lunch buffet is the best... So much variety, one needs a huge appetite to eat here! This place is mainly dominated by people who work near by nevertheless, families also do enjoy coming here.."
1.0,Below average food. Quality wise the price should have been 1/4 what they charged. The music was too loud and probably they invited someone to sing live. We had to change seats to face away from speakers when they said they can't turn down the volume.  Starters was good but the fried rice they served was really bad. The mutton Rogan Josh was tasteless.  I see people rating good for ambience but when the food is so bad nothing adds up.
5.0,"Great food accompanied by live music this place has it all! Never been to their other outlet but have heard a lot about this place especially from people who work nearby, this seems to be the place where most of the people come to experience authentic Punjabi food.

4.5,An upscale Punjabi restaurant in the Bellandur... The seating layout is cleverly designed and can double up as private sections if you are doing a group booking.  I liked the food so much especially the veg dishes (it feels like you are having home made food)!!! Planning to visit soon............

4.5,"The live singer here is so good! You don't realize how you spend hours here..  The food here is lovely with a touch of punjab, I found the food here pretty authentic as well! The dal makhni is the best I have had in Bangalore. I hope they stay the same."
4.5,"We keep coming to this place...  The food here has hooked us up really bad. First time I came here with my team and since then have been eating here a lot. The a la carte menu is really nice, lunch buffet is good for people who like eating a lot. Good experience always..."
2.0,I did not like the food much.... butter chicken was basic and Biryani actually didn't had anything that could justify it as biryani.....it was mix of rice and 2 pieces of fried chicken....roti was bit hard to eat.  Will not recommend it if you really are looking for punjabi food.
4.5,"This place never disappoints me, that's what I have come to observe in my 4 visits here, I have also eaten at their other outlet and loved it there as well! Food, ambiance and service is really good.  Good option for authentic Punjabi food close to commercial workplaces like Bellandur."
4.0,We ordered food at office from here... Very good food in taste we ordered Rara paneer which is my fav here and dal makhani ka good one draw back was they didn't gave raw onion and pickle which is kind of necessary in North Indian food.
4.5,"Wonderful place where you can hangout with friends and family. Friendly staff and they serve variety of good food.  The ambiance is also very nice. Out of all the dishes we had, starters was by far the best. Good variety and taste. Would eat here again and soon..."
4.5,"I think from the cutlery they use to the ambiance and the staff this place has impressed me. Live music is awesome as well, bollywood music and amazing punjabi food - the perfect night. The food is also priced appropriately. One must eat here..."
4.5,"Their website is really colorful. I am a stalker before visiting a place I do my research and then go ahead. You can reserve a table through their website which is handy... Mostly, weekends they are a bit crowded so it would be a good thing if you book a place in advance. Food - the main aspect is truly amazing. The variety is sufficient and the taste is beyond amazing."
5.0,Was really really hungry and this was the nearest place. I had been to their bannerghatta branch and the food we had was very tasty so we did not hesitate. The ambiance is pretty much the same but I really liked the service here. The staff here are very polite and always asking whether we liked the food or not. Lunch buffet was very VFM. I would recommend this place to everyone.
5.0,"Well people who think that you can't find amazing punjabi food in Bangalore you are highly mistaken and Punjabi Times proves you wrong. Starting with the ambiance, love it.. This is definitely a place where families can eat but also can be enjoyed by friends or a team as well. Always loved the buffet here and will keep eating here.."
4.0,"Punjabi Times is a fine-dining north-indian restaurant located on the ORR, close to Central Mall, Bellandur.  Taste (4.5/5) : Taste-wise, the restaurant gives you a very authentic experience with food high on masala and tangy curries. We started with masala papad with Kakori Kebab. One of the things that I miss in Bengaluru is good-roasted mutton with some coal-flavor as most of the places here serve fried kebabs. Punjabi Times serves excellent mutton kebabs and is definitely worth trying. For main course, we tried the butter chicken with garlic naan and gobhi paranthas. The gravy had the perfect sweet-savoury amalgamation which coupled excellently with the hot paranthas. For desserts, we ordered gulab jamun and gajar ka halwa. Gjar ka halwa is worth mentioning here as it was made up of red carrot and garnished with good 'ol khoya.  Ambience (4/5) : The restaurant has a dim-lighting kind of feel with plenty of seating and a separate buffet section. Was pretty deserted the night we visited, so felt really peaceful.  Service (4/5) : Everything was impeccable but the availability of various food items as it was a Monday when we visited and they were probably not expecting huge numbers, so went ahead by not being prepared with the full menu.  Value for money (4/5) : We were billed 1430 for 3 people which came out to be 500 per person. I would rate that pretty good for a fine-dining restaurant serving good north-indian food catering to authentic food cravers."
5.0,"Had a very hood time in punjabi times bellandur, We had a buffet Rs 500 + it was a great time with my friends andcollegue  Buffet foods really fresh start with asoup then all mail courses, after that all milky desserts yummy aswell Interior and service very fast dealy at all. I really will recommand to all my friends and many more."
4.5,Great food! Great ambiance especially the live music!!!! The starters are good but I enjoyed the main course more than the starters.. Very good place for families or big groups.. Highly recommended for good north Indian food..
5.0,When a punjabi restaurant has such amazing reviews you need to try and I am so glad that the place is true to what has been written! Ambiance - beautiful ( they have done full justice).. Service - staff members are always smiling and helping. Food - unbelievably good.
4.5,Finding a good restaurants in Bangalore amongst so many available itself is a challenge. Bellandur doesn't really have too many and I am glad I found Punabi Times. North Indian food is my fav and the food here is really good! Staff also are very polite and efficient. I would recommend their buffet...
5.0,"This is the perfect dining experience for families or big group of friends or a big group of colleagues, In short for everyone! The food and especially the quality of the food really blew my mind, a skeptic at heart but they did impress me...  I will go here again..."
1.0,We have faced a worst experience on Punjabi Times. We have been there on 1st Jan 2017. After reading the reviews from Zomato. There are some good reviews and this might be published by the Punjabi Times...  The starter are worst i have ever met in Bangalore.  There was no taste from the chicken starters and it seems like they collected the fresh meat and fired on oil.  The main course and the deserts very bad ....This is a good place to waste your money
5.0,"I was here before and remember having a positive experience. So was here again last week and this was a much better experience, they out did themselves. I remember really liking the ambiance from my first visit, which still continues. Coming to food, we tried the famous lunch buffet this time and now I know why everyone talks about it, really good variety and tasty tasty food.."
4.5,"These folks here really know how to make authentic Punjabi dishes! My countless visits here just proves that. This is one really good restaurant in Bellandur.  The ambiance, the service and obviously the food is truly amazing. Highly recommended."
5.0,"I had high expectation from this place especially after reading the reviews from zomato and asking my friends and obviously they lived up to the expectation. I cannot comment on other restaurants near bellandur but this one truly is amazing. The ambiance, the service, the food and also the live music ( me and my friends really enjoyed). Cheers..."
5.0,"I find punjabi times perfect for office get togethers like a team lunch. Came here 3 weeks back and my colleague had heard about their lunch buffet so we thought we can give this place a try.  The buffet was too good, starting from chats to the starters main course and desserts I have no complaints, every dish served was tasty.."
4.5,"Good good good and good! i always rely on zomato when it comes to trying out different restaurants and I love eating north indian food and hence found Punjabi Times. Close to where I stay, we visited last night for dinner and absolutely loved the food. It was slightly crowded considering it was the weekend. The service, the ambiance, the food all were just amazing..."
1.0,"Highly overrated and over peiced restraunt. Yesterday I visited the restraunt. WHEN I ENTERED INITIALLY THE ROOM WAS SMELLING SO BAD I REQUESTED FOR ROOM freshner... The food were not so good. Out of the wide range of dishes we tried I can't say that a single dish was extraordinary for the amount that I have paid upon. Also the waiter was way too cheesy, he constantly kept forcing to order more and more quantity. He was like, sir itne log itne me nhi hoga. Not worththe money bieng thrown for."
1.0,"Zomato rating is 4.  However, according to my last order it should be a big 0. Ordered Murg Lababdar and the gravy taste was pathetic. Felt like half box of chat masala was put in it. Chicken pieces TERRIBLE!!!  Please don't get misleaded by the rating."
4.5,"Punjabi cuisine has to be my favorite... Never grew tired of eating punjabi khana.. Also, in Bangalore you don't find a lot of places serving good punjabi food but Punjabi Times is definitely an exception. The buffet is something that I really like and also found it value for money. Recommended..."
2.0,I had a pretty bad first experience here. Not only the food but the Service was bad. Went here for lunch with almost 20 people and they charged us for 21 people. The arguments were endless and overall behaviour was bad. I'm not sure if I'll be going here again.                                                                  bhookhibella.wordpress.com
5.0,"Really one of the best restaurants in Bangalore which serves amazing punjabi food! Its really hard to find places that serve such good food and I am truly happy that I discovered Punjabi Times... The decor, ambiance, music, staff and food especially is great. Been here twice and will be back soon..."
1.0,"Worst experience. We came to restaurant on Friday night to have dinner. Starters we ordered were completely cold as if it was pre-cooked. Taste was OK. Nothing special about the food. Restaurant cannot handle when more number of customers step in. They are serving starters and no one brought the water by that time. What do you think, how much I should rate this place. Sad to be here."
2.5,"Bad! Checking Zomato ratings thought of trying this place. Total disappointment that too on Friday.  Amplify your food quality, service and do hire guys who serves food without spilling on the table. Wondering who rated 4.1 ??? Firangi sabji tawa fry a disaster. Over cooked broccoli and added chat masala. Excess of salt. Real bad!  Al carte food should be blissful and soulful but I don't see it here.  Only saviour was veg Khichidi with that perfect taste."
5.0,The one place we always go for team lunches!! Not a lot of places in Bellandur and when we like a restaurant we stick to it! Its been so many months the first time we ever tried this place and hence been a fan and a regular customer at Punjabi Times. The lunch buffet is so VFM and perfect for big groups. Good variety of food and good service as well!
4.5,"We had a lunch team gathering here with 8 folks. The seat was easily available & the service started quite fast with a warm welcome by the staff. The north indian thali's are authentic & with more options than you can eat. The chat options are also good & very tasty. There was no way anyone of us could go back to office after such a stomach filled lunch & oureyes were looking for a bed to sleep. Overall nice ambience, very friendly staff, quick delivery & quite affordable pricing. I would love to go there again.                                                                 foodie.prorido.com"
4.5,Eating here reminds me of home food!!! Not only that the ambiance also reminds you of punjab the earthy interiors really adds a nice touch.. This has to be one of the few good restaurants in bellandur and I am glad I stay near by. Food has always impressed me. Must try place.
5.0,"Have you ever been so obsessed with a place that most of time you find yourself eating here? I have, Punjabi Times has to be one of the most amazing restaurants in Bellandur... Ambiance - top class. Service - 5/5 (really polite staff) Food - no words, you need to try to find out.. A big fan of this place."
1.0,"All the reviews which are rated 5.0 for this restaurant are somehow fake or paid. There is no way that someone can rate it 5.0 We had a horrible experience on 1st Jan here. Ordered their so called famous makke di roti with sarso da saag, the saag was tasteless and roti was not also good. We also ordered paneer tikka masala and mushroom masala with chilly cheese naan and butter naan. Paneer was not fresh and mushroom masala was pathetic. Chilly cheese naan is overrated in reviews.  As if this was not enough, they have a second hand music system which is used for live performances. The sound was so loud and irritating that we cannot talk to each other. And they include this in their service charge.  The total bill sums up for 2100 which was not even worth for 500. The tax and service charge combined was 25% of the total bill."
1.0,"Horrible experience !!! On 1st Jan'2017 I went there with my friends, though we booked table from Zomato, we had to wait for quite a minutes to get proper place to seat. Coming to food, we asked for buffet, probably the biggest mistake we did. No variety at all, got some 2 plates of chicken starter that too test was pretty avg, same goes for main course. Test were really poor all throughout the buffet. Thought dessert section will be good, that was also really avg with no variety at all. Coming to service, probably the pathetic service I had in any restro till date in Bangalore. Every time I needed something I literally need to call some one from far. Although they charged some Rs 350 for it.  The worst part was, though we booked for a lunch, they charged for DINNER BUFFET !!!! PATHETIC PUNJABI TIMES !!!"
5.0,Was really really hungry and 3 of us planned to enjoy their lunch buffet and that was the best decision we took that day. Ambiance makes you really happy and ready to gorge on some amazing food. The buffet has good no of dishes and we had a great time eating .. Good thing we did not have to go back to work otherwise we would have slept for sure after having such a great meal....
5.0,I have been eating for quiet a long time now... There is nothing about this place that I don't like...  Ambiance - 5/5 Food - 6/5 Service - 5/5 Food quality has always been consistent and the prices are also not too crazy. Recommended..
3.0,We visited the place with family. Food was okayish and over priced. We went for lunch and it took them 30 mins to serve. Service is slow and sluggish. Music was also not good.
5.0,"Loved the ambience with Punjabi culture and dishes. It has options for both Buffet (during lunch) and Ala Carte (all meals). - Quality - Great Cuisine: Punjabi, North Indian Ambiance- Great Food - Amazing Overall Experience - 5/5"
5.0,There are no shortage of restaurants in Bangalore and I stay close enough to be able to try new places.. I try to eat at new places every week but when it comes to eating authentic north Indian I go nowhere else.. Punjabi times has been my fav for the longest time. Amazing ambiance amazing service amazing food..
4.5,"If you are not so keen on visiting punjab then just go to Punjabi Times... The ambiance will make you feel like you are in Punjab.. The interiors are very well laid out.. Spacious seatings as well. Coming to food, I would definitely recommend the buffet. Lot of varieties and at a good price... Hot hot authentic food which tastes yummy - Punjabi times is amazing..."
2.5,"I won't suggest anyone for buffet in weekdays, although ambience is quiet ok but cost of buffet according to taste is not comparable at all...!! We were 11 members visited this place for team lunch but not a single one was happy after coming out of it...!!"
4.5,"Ambiance - Totally cool - punjabi feel to the place adds to your experience... Food: Very very satisfied with the food, being in Bellandur one of the few places that really served good food. Often me and my colleagues eat here.. Service and staff: A real Plus point here i believe. A good hospitality can impress anyone.  Keep up the same good work.."
5.0,Get a wholesome meal here.. A wonderful place for foodies and anyone who enjoys eating in general.. This place is my choice whenever crave for punjabi food!! and of course the courteous staff! Do visit for punjabi taste.
3.0,"Food over this place was average. We ordered Paneer Sizzler, Mix Veg. Tandoori (starter), Dal Tadka, Raita, butter milk, jeera rice and masala papad. Except for the Masala papad, rest of all the items were average (taste wise).  Ambience was good and there was a live performance by a singer on some good old songs.  Overall a very average place to dine."
2.0,Ambience of the place is good. Nice service and cosy place to hangout. Coming to food I will rate this place an average. We ordered pudina chicken as one of the starters. But on table the dish was like capsicum chicken. I told the writer but he ignored my comments. Main course chicken dish had gravy which was not thick like any punjabi dish would. Also the chicken had a smell.  All in all no taste in food as per the rates on menu card. For me not again here on my choice.
5.0,"This review of mine is based on many many visits... Located in bellandur it is a magnet for professionals and families like wise.. If you really want to eat authentic north Indian khana, this is your place in Bellandur.. The classic makke ki roti and sarso da saag here is too good. .. Service is good and food mind blowing... Will obviously keep visiting this place.."
5.0,"Tasty north Indian food, good ambiance and good place to go with family. I really liked paneer and mushroom starters!! One place where you can enjoy both veg and non-veg dishes!! Not a lot of places excel in both ... Price wise it is moderate.."
1.0,This restaurant is charging 10% service charges on ur total bill. Besides govt taxes like service tax and VAT we have to pay them 10% extra for their employees. They call it as service charge. This restaurant is looting people. Besides that the food is too costly and average in taste. I don't have option of giving them zero otherwise I would have given them a big ZERO.
5.0,"Good food luv the chilli cheese naan there,have trief both ala carte and buffet!! I liked both! Nice ambience and one of the better places for dinner in bellandur and sarjapur. Good place for families and friends and colleagues! Highly recommended..."

5.0,Was here on a weekday!! The buffet are such value for money!! The thoko thali is amazing - 21 varieties for 279 bucks is just insane... Ambiance is good gives you the punjabi feeling! The food is great.. especially the buffet..
1.5,"My first order from Punjabi Times, it took 1.5 hours for the person to reach 1 km distance. So, poor delivery. Food: Ordered Dal Khichdi, wasnt great. Normal rice used, no Basmati rice. Pineapple raita was ok. Onions were stale.  Please improve your delivery time and also food quality."
5.0,Good food. I went on a weekday and the lunch had a buffet spread.  The food variety was pretty decent........  Nice place. Liked paneer starters. And liked lassi.  Biryani was also really nice. A good place for families to eat at...

5.0,Nearest food joint to my place so m pretty much regular to this place and trust me its the best option in 5 km radius of bellandur. We opted for the buffet this time and we were not disappointed at all. They had a variety of starters both veg and non-veg. All the starters were just too good.  I love this place...

5.0,"As per the atmosphere....the place screams punjabi...  Coming to the food, The quantity is excellent. Also the taste of paneer curries, dal makhani,was good.

4.5,"Visited this place with my colleagues. It was awesome to be there, Retro live music with good food. Ambience was also quite decent. You can go with family and friends as well. Worth to visit."
4.5,"Who said that you can't get authentic Punjabi food in Namma Bengaluru!  This place never disappoints, that's what I have observed from my five visits to Punjabi Times.  If you are a hard-core non-vegetarian and will always prefer your Butter Chicken over a cheesy Pizza, this place is meant for you. Food quality, quantity and taste, all three are top-notch."
4.5,Last Friday was my first visit to this place! Came here for a family dinner... This place is real close to where I stay and a lot of people recommended this place. Ambiance - good. Food - great. Service - great. Overall Experience - amazing...

5.0,The food here is really great! Want to experience amazing north Indian food then this is your place..  I have been a regular at this outlet and the place hasn't disappointed me once. Good service. Great staff and most importantly great food....
5.0,"""BALLE ! BALLE ! Going in a group for some Punjabi food ! This is it! Following the Friday tradition of ensuring that we colleagues go out for Friday dinner we landed at Punjab Times ! We choose the buffet - The spread was really nice, starters, main course, and desserts all were amazing.. Lovely place."
1.5,"Team outing could be fun but it's not when you go to Punjabi Times. Went with some good expectation after seeing the rating and photos available on Zomato but we were quite disappointed. We have opted for buffet and we had to wait for quite some times for the food as most of the things were not ready and cold. Vegetarian people might find some good dishes but there is nothing for non-vegetarian people, absolutely nothing. Ambiance was not okay. No cleanliness in the restaurant. It looked like they haven't cleaned it from ages. Given the quality of the food and cleanliness, the food wasn't even worth of 100/-. Not Recommend for buffet at-least."
5.0,"Good food. Good ambience. Good location. Reasonable rates. Decent service. Visited this place for a lunch with office colleagues recently. We ordered both veg and non-veg food from the A La Carte Menu. They have good options in the menu. Chicken starters were really nice! Veg options - we liked the main course a lot! Overall, a good experience..."
5.0,"The restaurant's ambiance is nice with decorations done with bangles..something different.  The service was really good.  Coming to the food, I have tried both a-la-carte and buffet and I must say I like the buffet here more.. Food also is not very expensive without compromising on the quality."
5.0,They serve really good North Indian food. We always get their Dal Makhani.  Service is also very good.  The person who was serving us took good care.  Located in Bellandur it does get crowded on weekdays but service is really fast as well! Loved the decor! Highly recommended...
5.0,"Some very good Punjabi dishes are available here. I really suggest this place to everyone especially vegetarians as I like the veg food not many restaurants in Bangalore get north Indian food right and Punjabi Times nails it! Courteous staff, amazing ambiance and quick service. Always a good time."
4.0,"This was my first visit...for family lunch on Sunday. Great food, ok ambience, good service. Worth the money. Really liked the non-veg platter."
4.0,Woaaahhhh.... My first review that I am writing even before I have paid the bill. The food here is heavenly. I loved the Lahori Shikanji. Good punjabi music and good food will surely satisfy your taste buds. The only thing that bothered a little was their fly problem... But still who can resist a good food even if they are just flies.
4.5,"Punjabi Times is located on the main road and is located on the 3rd floor. It can be very easily spotted and can be quite tiresome to get there if you're stuck with traffic. We happened to visit this place just by chance. Since it's very close to my office, I visited this place with my colleagues. This place turned out to be quite a surprise package for me. The dcor is really nice and gives you feels like you are really in Punjab. There are some really quite props, and the entire place depicts a hamlet in Punjab.There's some live music to keep you entertained as well. The service is pretty prompt too. Theyalso have buffets at certain times. Since I visited this place with my group of non-vegetarian friends, I decided to stick to my vegetarian meal which could just cater to me. So, I zeroed on the Sizzling Platter option that they had. It wasthe first time that I had North-Indian food on a sizzling platter. It had some amazing butter kulchas, some rice, a filled roasted papad,few pieces of tikki and some hot channa. It was amazing. Mynon-vegetarian friends had some mutton biryani, some portion of chicken gravy and some tandoori breads. They didn'tquite like the non-vegetarianfood. But, I definitely loved whatI had. I'm definitely going back :)"
5.0,"Another team lunch adventure which turned out to be fun. The fact that we were eating in a punjabi themed restaurant.  Food will surely give you Punjabi taste and nicely served... took a bit long to serve but was hotttt ( considering the order of 12 people lol) Overall, its a great place to have lunch or dinner!"
5.0,"I really had a great experience at their Bannerghatta outlet! Owing to that, me and my colleagues made a visit to the bellandur branch! The weight you carry when you suggest a hotel and want everyone to like it - its a lot!  Thankfully all my colleagues enjoyed their experience as well. Service was good and so was the ambiance and the food."
5.0,Food is amazing.  Lip smacking north Indian Punjabi food. Another Good thing about this place is live music and ambiance.  Never get tired of this place... Been here almost 10 times now and still crave the food. Keep up the good work!
5.0,"Located in Bellandur, I can definitely say this is one the most crowded and happening place especially for food! Most of the crowd are working professionals nevertheless it is family friendly place. I have been here numerous times and I have really had a great experience. From the service to the food and price - all fantastic. Must visit place."
3.0,A Family drinking place. What? Yes you heard it right. The ambience gives you exactly that kind of feel with 60s and 70s live music and dim lights. The food is decent though the service was a little slow. Not exactly the mind of place you would visit with your gang
5.0,"Good food, amazing taste specially Mango lassi and Chicken dishes I really liked the food here and the service was also good. We had a palak-methi chicken side dish, the chicken just melts in your mouth. The veggi options were quite interesting too. I wonder how I missed such a nice place so far and will definitely go again."
1.0,"Highly overpriced and mediocre food. I have been to Punjabi Times in bannerghatta road  and it was a delight. However , her it was exact reverse. Curry dishes were mediocre in flavor. Even the lassi was unbearable."

3.0,"So, me and my friend went here for dinner after a long day at work. The ambience and staff were very welcoming. We ordered one paneer dish, one starter, Badam rabdi and gulab jamun. The food was not up to the expectations. I liked the desserts only. There was live music, which was very good. It is a bit expensive restaurant compared to the quality of the food."
4.5,Any one who wants to eat north ka khanna it one of the better place in bellandur I recommend dal makhani with butter naan (must try) Starters were Good and tasty especially Paneer and Chicken. This is one of those places that i like to visit once in every month !!!

The menu has something for every taste and nutrition need. Paranthas for the young and hurried ones, great tandoori food for the discerning palates and ofcourse the desserts. Overall good and well done punjabi food."

5.0,"For a hard core Punjabi food lover, and one who has sampled most Punjabi fare that is on offer in the city, this restaurant was like a breath of fresh air.  The food..aah the food is good. Very good in fact. Skipped the starters, dug straight into the main course of phulkas, dum alu-baby potatoes in a delectable savory tomato gravy and a paneer lahori, paneer in a cashew sauce. Left me licking my fingers in the end.  The servings were just right. The jeera rice was mildly flavored.  The shikanji was the tangy and sweet and a perfect compliment to the food."
5.0,"Located bang on Outer ring road surrounded by IT offices , it is bound to be crowded during Lunch time . Loved the decor - garish , audacious , loud colors , very different and nice ! Serves good Punjabi food. Price is okay!! We did not like one dish and he willingly offered to replace it. That is wow factor. I went there couple of times now. Always had good experience."
4.5,"Visited Punjabi times last Saturday and was happy with the service and the quality of food. The service was prompt and the live performance was great. Its a good place to visit for North India food for the people staying in Outer Ring Road/Sarjapur Road area!! I would go again and again for the high quality food that is served. Soft paneer, tasty starters and desserts and service most of all.."
5.0,"Quality - Great Cuisine: Punjabi, North Indian Loved the ambience with Punjabi culture and dishes. It has options for both Buffet (during lunch) and Ala Carte (all meals).  They host a live performance during the dinner. Mostly suitable for families, friends and corporate team lunches."
5.0,"I was here before and remember having a positive experience. SO, writing this from our dinner last night!! We had the Baby Corn Tilwala and Railway Murg for starters. Garlic naan, Roomali Roti, Butter Chicken, Paneer Tikka Masala ... catering to the vegetarian and non-veg parts of the family. All the dishes were delightfully good and the way we expected them to be when they are cooked well ... the flavor, spice, seasoning and the cooking / baking itself.  The food was amazing. Will be back again.."
5.0,"Yesterday, to complete my birthday, we decided to visit this restaurant which is closer to home for a quick quiet dinner. The restaurant looked nice when we entered and happened to spot a nice 6 seater table at a corner. Right from the dcor, food and service everything was top class, I felt really pampered...  Don't miss the aloo sev tikki, aam ka panna, butter chicken and of course the paranthas!!!!"

4.5,"When you walk into Punjabi times, you get a feel of Punjab, without being in Punjab. The wall hangings, the color, the accessories, they all give you glimpses of Punjab. To add to this you get close to authentic food!! We always get their Dal Makhani. Service is also very good. I went there couple of times now. Always had good experience."
4.5,Authentic Punjabi food and the aura is just so wonderful here. Been to the bannerghatta branch last month and had a wonderful experience.  I was totally bowled over with the excellent food.  Good option in Bellandur when it comes to good north Indian food.

3.0,Taste - 3 Ambience - 4 Service - 3 Value for Money - 2.5 Menu Variety - 4  First thing that comes to my mind is there are better Punjabi food I have had in Bangalore than here. Which is not wat u wanna feel wen u go to a new restaurant. All food items were mediocore. The need to take  pictures for reviewing it here was also not compelling. I think they Shud improve the quality of food soon.
5.0,"If you love food along with live music this can surely be good place to visit. Friendly staff. Great Ambience. As for the food - great taste and good variety, for both veg and non-veg. Quality and taste is consistent, be it starters, main course, drinks or even the desserts. Even the pricing is good, neither too expensive nor too cheap!! The food you eat definitely justifies the pricing..."

3.0,"I have ordered food twice for home delivery, both for veg and non-veg food. The food tastes decent with mostly a soft taste with all curries tasting similar. The curries that I ordered were put as chef recommended and were not much of taste but loaded with extra shots of cream and oil. The vegetables used seemed to be of good quality and delivery quality was also decent."
5.0,Best experience ever... If you want to spend your money on really good food and great ambiance then you should visit this place. Came here on a weekday and even on a weekday the place was crowded. Both veg and non-veg dishes were yummy...

The ambience is quite nice with decent service. A must try                                                                 akhilkohlifoodjourney.wordpress.com"

4.0,Now this restaurant made me happy for being classy and serving one of the best Punjabi food post Bhatinda Junction.  Quantity and Quality both are super delight in here.  And how can I miss the ambience and service over there. A pure class.  The live music of Kishore Da and Rafi Sahab will sooth and ease ur pressure of work life and then the food is just icing on the cake. The manager Jugal is an appreciable personality for sure.   Must Visit guys!!
4.5,"Location 4/5 Ambiance 4.5/5 Food 4/5 Service 5/5 Price 4/5  Located on service lane of ORR, Punjabi times is on a building which has Glassy and Tipsy Bull - The Bar exchange. It has ample parking space with an underground parking.  I love the ambiance with soothing retro Hindi live music. Food is amazing and I especially love the paan ice cream which comes at the end. Place is kid friendly and they give balloon to kids to keep them occupied. I am a frequent visitor of this place for lip smacking north Indian Punjabi food. For mouth freshener, they offer jaggery which is characteristic Punjabi style."
4.5,"Whenever I have craved for good north Indian food, Punjabi Times has been my savior!! Located in Bellandur it is near by my place hence, when I don't wanna cook I grab a meal here! I really like the ambiance and the staff! Food - what can I say? I always like my fingers!!"
4.5,"I got door delivery couple of times in my relatives house in Bellandur.  I am impressed with their vegetarian dishes with breads - Tandoori roti and Romali roti and Naan, simple plain breads!!  Door delivery was done with patience. Save money travelling to Koramangala or Indira Nagar for any other fancy eateries. Highly Recommended - You can select a lot of wholemeal breads and order more salads in this place."
4.0,Not been to many restaurants in bellandur but Punjabi times has definitely been one of my favorites so far!  A great place to eat good food with friends and family! Have tried their buffet and a-la carte both very satisfying!!  Will definitely recommend this place to everyone!
1.0,I ordered Railway murg.it was very very bad.not fresh at all and hard like rock...you guys are charging so high ...but why the food quality is so bad?will never order again.
4.0,"We went in a group of 7 people to this place. We received a warm welcome into the place. The starters were of utmost quality. The tandoori chicken is a must for all the people who are non vegetarian, special mention to the masala papad. Only two let down points tandoori chicken seemed to have been used in the gravy too for butter chicken and at the end it seemed like staff is in a hurry to close it as it was around 11.30 pm."
4.5,"This place is should definetely be on your list if you haven't already tried! This has become my go to place when I am craving some yummy north Indian dishes!  From the ambiance to the service and the food, Punjabi times has never disappointed me, come here with friends or family you are bound to have a good time.."
3.0,"Okay food. Too much over done with the interior in name of Punjab, and to bring that ethic look but it is too much loud. The food was not that great, but yes it seemed fine if you are looking for north Indian food in the amidst of dusty outer ring road. There was no salt in food. And the waiters seemed in hurry. But yes , the music definitely try to remind you of old Punjabi songs of Daler mehndi."
4.0,Punjabi Times is one of my favorite places to gorge on some authentic and tasty Punjabi food! The ambiance pulls me to this place every time ! They have done a great job on the interiors!! The food be it vegetarian or non-vegetarian dishes I enjoyed eating both! The menu is quite extensive so everyone will find something they like! Highly recommended !!
4.0,"I have been to Punjabi times with family and friends. I really loved the ambience. The food was really good especially murg Bhatinda and mutton Rogan josh.  The service is good and the food is just amazing, I always end up eating here when we have something to celebrate ! Though you might find it a bit expensive but worth the money."
4.5,"Go there for an authentic Punjabi cuisine to salivate your taste buds at a decent price!! You can select a lot of wholemeal breads and order more salads in this place.  The staff is very attentive, who would recommend decent dishes and is patient enough to explain the menu. My all time favorite is the Malay Kabab! Valet parking is available."
4.0,"Good selection of Kebabs and other Punjabi dishes.  The chicken kababs were certainly the best and most flavorful.  The vegetarian dishes were also good.  Excellent place to hangout with friends, family, corporate meals, snacks, drinks, with live music & songs, good music, quick & prompt service, well laid out menu and above all, comes good on pocket. Another must visit place!"
4.0,"If you are searching for any Punjabi restaurant then perhaps your searching would come to an end in this restaurant.  We came in some time late and were amazed with the ambience. It was really and fully Punjab ka atmosphere. All the pictures and wall hangings and decorations remind you of Punjab. Coming to the food, it was authentic too."
4.5,"Located in Bellandur, one of the most crowded but happening It corridor of Bangalore, this place has got the location advantage for sure.  When you enter the place, the ambiance is something which doesn't go unnoticed. The food was really good especially murg Bhatinda and mutton Rogan josh.  Though you might find it a bit expensive but worth the money."
2.5,"Punjabi times is great for everything else other than food.The ambience,the live music was stupendous. But ultimately what matters is the food.I had ordered veg seekh kebabs and murg galauti kebabs for starters.Both of them weren't up to the mark.Veg seekh kebab was too dry and the galauti kebab felt rubbery.The main course wasn't that great either. Had ordered murg pathankot which was really average. Mr Nizam was the singer and he made the entire experience really tolerable by his fantastic singing."
3.5,Good Punjabi food with ambience just enhancing the Punjab flavour. The tandoori chicken starters are good. Punjabi times has live ghazals nights on Saturdays which definitely adds to the flavour.
5.0,"Have been here many times and every time the food served is great. My friends love some of the Veg dishes here and I love the chicken Dishes.  Good staff, great service!! A good variety available for both vegetarian and non-vegetarians, my no1 place when it comes to serving north Indian food!!!"
4.5,Visited this place on a Sunday for dinner with family! As the name suggests you will have a great Punjabi time here...  From the ambiance to the food and the service - they really stole my heart!! The ambiance is really delightful and gives you a great dining experience! Coming to food - anything you order you will enjoy for sure....
3.5,"Food is too good here. Specially if your mood is on for punjabi food, I do prefer going on here. It's neat to my place and ambience is good. Decent people come here to enjoy their dinner or lunch. Cool"
4.0,"The food is really good here, especially if you are looking for good north Indian dishes!! Right from the ambiance to the service, I completely enjoyed my experience! The staff are really hospitable and efficient! Both veg and non veg dishes give you the taste same as northern India."
4.0,Nice place ! Alive ambience ! You can request your song anytime throughout your time ! Food and service can be improved ! Friendly atmosphere
4.5,Awesome cool & calm place. A place to relax. Awesome quality food. Live music (at least when I visited). Parking available. Great service. Great place to hang out with friends. I am sure I will visit there again. Loved the place.
2.0,"Continuing with the trend of trying as many restaurants as possible in Bellandur, thought to order from here. I have seen the roof top restaurant many times and its in my list to visit. But today ordered a home delivery.  We ordered Dhingri Matar aka Mutter Mushroom and Paneer Tikka Masala.  To be honest very disappointed with both the dishes. First the gravies were not at all tasty and Paneer Butter Masala had just one Capsicum n Onion instead of what was described in the menu. Smaller take aways serves much better and tasty dishes than this place.  Quantity was okay. Order took considerable time to deliver.  May be will still go and visit the restaurant and try their Non vegeterian dishes hoping that they will be much better than these"
4.5,I am not a fan of north indian food but this place makes me fall in love with north indian food. The punjabi food here is just so good that you really cant get enough of this place. Great Punjabi Taste with good ambiance. Service is too good. Food just too too good!!
4.0,Looking for good north Indian food in Bellandur? Looking for good punjabi cuisine in Bellandur? Looking for a good ambiance and great service? Punjabi times it is!! My first experience and safe to say not my last because I will be coming here more often now !! The food - too yummy and lip smacking.... Affordable as well.
4.0,"Pretty place with some good Punjabi food. If you're missing on some good Dal Makhni and Malai Kofta, then this is a perfect place for you (:"
4.5,"I have been a frequent visitor to their other outlet that is in Bannerghatta road. Been a fan of this place since then. As the name suggests they make some really really tasty punjabi food and solely you should go there to try some of it. Over these past few months, I have tried so many dishes and had no complaints so far. Keep up the good work."
3.5,"Visited this place for lunch and had food in buffet. Items were okay. Well prepared fish and chicken items and special mention for the fish fry which was truly yum. Only disturbing factor was a very odd stench persisting for a very long time. However, you would'nt appreciate something like this in a leisure/lunch time. Maybe that day was an exception, but still I would say that the authorities should have taken care of it."
4.5,Authentic Punjabi restaurant with Nice artistic decor. Gets very crowded on weekends !!!! Sarso-da-saag and makke-di-roti was so delicious and there authentic daal tadka was just mind blowing. Ambiance was good and servicing was really great.  Towards the end of our meal we ordered lassi and aam ka panna. Lassi was thick and well made and aam ka panna was extremely refreshing.
4.0,Been to this place twice !! Food is great and hospitality is one of the best !! The waiter's are always welcoming... this really shows how well they are trained to handle people !!! The food undoubtedly the best I have had in a while. The presentation to the serving and the preparation all good! Will surely visit this place again.
4.5,"The place is great. Nice welcome at the door. Old Hindi songs. Got a good view from 3rd floor. But the menu is too complicated. So many Hindi words, confuses you a lot. I ordered chicken biryani, don't remember it's Hindi name. Like I said too complicated. Food was spicy and tasty. Staff is polite and there is considerable distance between 2 adjacent tables. Give the restaurant a spacious look. Also, they had 2+1 offer on Corona. Being a huge Corona lover, I jumped at the offer. 3 Corona in a Corona Bucket. Loved it. Absolutely loved it."
2.5,"The food is average but if you want to be treated well by the staff, don't go. They don't value the customers. I went there with my wife but we dint feel good at all. The staff is really unfriendly. They are never around. Every Time you have to wait and ask them to come to your table for any small or big thing. No professionalism match to the price they charge for their food."
4.0,This is another must try punjabi restraunt if you are a punjabi food lover. Definately Not much expensive than other big Punjabi restraunts in town which are simply cheating people on the name  This one is serving authentic punjabi food with some great punjabi music and ambience..   They have valet parking service to avoid parking chaos on bellandur busy roads..  Visit once if you are staying or working near outer ring road or HSR layout
4.5,"The best daal makhni in the city so far. The ambience is really good. Even after a tiring day if u pay a visit you will come out refreshed. Its a bit costly though but worth the money. Even the ambience and service of this place reminds you of similar places in delhi/punjab. Must try the chicken shorba, Ralway Murg and Bhatinda murg. Keep up the good work, me and our team keep visiting occasional"
4.5,"Located in Bellandur, one of the most crowded but happening It corridor of Bangalore, this place has got the location advantage for sure. When you enter the place, the ambiance is something which doesn't go unnoticed. Try the amazing north indain food here, typical real good tasty punjabi food and the atmosphere takes you to punjab and there is no doubt about that!!! The tandoor platter is here is just mouth boggling and cooked to perfection.  The service is fast and the ambience is real great."
5.0,Name caught my attention. Visited to have a meal at luxury. It is very rare that a Chef approaches you and suggest dishes as per your preferences. Chef Avinash is very hospitable. Food is good and worth what we pay for. Mocktails are worth trying.
1.0,"Worst Punjabi food I've ever had... Totally waste of money.. Very expensive and not worth at all. Won't consider this restaurant ever.... Even the gravy that is supposed to be spicy, it was extremely sweet..."
4.0,"This was such an unplanned visit but I am glad because I am surely going to visit this place more often!!  Their ambiance is very pretty, and the staff is also very prompt.  Coming to food, be in vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes all taste very well.  Had a great time."
4.5,"In my opinion, if you want to have good authentic punjabi food this is your place!! A classy and sophisticated ambiance which served great food, what more do you need? Starters were really nice! Food is good and so was the service."
4.0,"Food: Amritsari Ghar ki biryani- Ghosht + Chil Mil pulao, preparation was dry, but I did not know what to expect from Amritsari preparation. Chil Mil Pulao was delightful.  Service: Very hospitable, despite going in past the time for the last order, the staff did not shoo us away but offered whatever was feasible.  Ambiance: Moderate to dim lighting, good for groups, families and couples alike. Good view of the ORR and surrounding area, if that matters.  Must Try: Chil Mil Pulao"
4.5,"One of the best places to come and enjoy authentic Punjabi cuisine. All the kababs reminded meof the north. The butter chicken authentic and really well made. Most punjabi places in the city do have different intonations of their food even if its punjabi, but this place keeps it real and authentic. Spent a good no of hours here, eating great food!! Looking forward to visit this place again..."
3.5,A nice place to dine with family. It lives by its name as the punjabi setup and taste is thoroughly maintained. The ambience is nice and inviting. Live singer singing old bollywood songs adds to the charm.
4.0,Went their unplanned on a Monday night. It was empty but I heard good reviews on them.  The menu is just Punjabi. We ordered non veg platter and 2 sizzler combos along with lassi. Good food but bit expensive. Service was good. Must try if you are near bellandur.
3.5,Nice punjabi style food . Ordered murg sizzler which was good taste . The rotis served in that hard to chew . Tandoori chicken taste was normal . Nice live Hindi songs which was plus mark here . Staff are nice .
3.5,"Nice place. Located near to where i am put up and i do occasionally pay a visit here. The ambience is good. Overlooking the busy outer ring road gives a fine view from the 3rd floor. The place has a good punjabi aura about it. Food is good. Some are great, some could be better. My favourites here are : chicken lababdar and bhatti da murg. Oh, and about that guy who sings here, he makes a really good effort and sings great! We can request the songs and he will sing it on karaoke. Overall, a fine place to relax and have a nice punjabi dinner."
3.5,I went here unplanned for a lunch with my friend . The  food I felt was average but the prices were a bit high for the quality they were providing. The service was pretty slow . Overall I would say its not a bad place to have a meal.
5.0,"Good food.... Especially railway chicken, Good presentation....with authentic plates, Good ambience.... With a good live music which really makes ur mood good. I went for frst tym... It ws really a gud xperience.... Wud fr sure visit agn..."
4.5,"This place deserves more than a 3.6 rating it currently has. The only thing bad maybe is the location where it is situated. Had it been situated on the 100 Feet Road, I am sure people would have been going gaga over this!!! The restaurant is very unique in their taste and style. Tasty chola bhatura, makke ki roti nd saag, In starters - Sev tikki and baby corn, and mini samosa were tasty but Panner tikka was yummy as well. Chaats were gud.. Papri chaat was very tasty. There was Chanch, soup and jaljeera..  Seating is quit comfortable and pleasing. Overall, I was surprised finding such nice place in Bellandur area. It was though a little bit costly."
3.5,"1. Ambiance was nice, very colorful. 2. You will get makki da roti, sarso da saag from live counter. 3. Starters are good. specially I liked the fish fry. 4. Service was a bit sloppy. They were quite a bit late to refill the food, specially the desert section."
4.5,"Very nice resta, i had twin been there and every time i tasted excellent food.ambience is fabulous, you can request/dedicate songs to your loved ones.Nice family/couple resta"
2.5,I wont be bias as Im a punjabi by mah behaviour #friendsqoutethis #proudbong though.ohk these serve indian food with punjabi tadhka.but the disappoint is the staffs We were in late hours of buffet but we were before 3 still they were in continous conversation to convence us to not to go for buffet just for there wish to rap up beforetime.i hated this attitude of there. And havent visited to the place after that day
1.5,"The place is just besides our office and we visit them often. Off late the quality has seen a dip and attitude has seen equal increase. Their buffet spread is wide but definitely not wide enough for 700 bucks. Quality till date was quite good but our last experience on Wednesday was horrible.  Chole and sarso da saag on punjabi counter was stale and we were the first one's to reach at 12 so could see it coming out of cold storage, makkai roti was stale and dough was raising a smell, it was clearly more than 2 days old. Who ever ate the combo fell sick.  Curries and starters are decent and so are their chats but with a giant bakasur next door and with latter's buffet spread even grand, punjabi times need to have self introspection.  Specifically to mention, manager's attitude  was uncalled for and felt as if we are committing SIN by coming here.  Not quite recommended unless they improve quality and reduce attitude"
3.5,"visited this place today for a farewell of my friend. Good number of varieties of food. Specially loved the starters tandoori aloo,  crispy corn, paneer starter, veg kebab, samosa. The corn pulao was good and the makki ki roti and sarson ka sag.  The desserts mango phirni, gazar ka halwa, gulab jamun with ice cream was delicious.  Except for the overpricing this place is really good for its ambience,  it's service and food."
4.0,Great ambience. A Family place. Home like punjabi food. Nice service. Efficient and courteous. Best point was the collection of songs being played.
3.0,"The food was good and decent pricing as well! Got disappointed with the service and wait time, ambience could have been better (Looks so Dead to me)."
3.5,Every now and then it's good to be taken out of your comfort zone intentionally or unintentionally and that's what happened while ordering the veg platter from here. Among the 20 pieces they promised was an assortment of fruits grilled. Now technically a veg platter that has fruits conflicts with what the definition of veg means. If veg means vegetables then what are fruits doing in my platter? If veg means vegetarian ergo non-meat then ok I guess you can bend the rules a little bit. But tasting tandoori flavoured apples and pears and guavas and Sweet potato/tapioca  (I think) was a shocker. I'm still on the fence about whether I liked it or not but all I will say for sure is that I was totally surprised by it. So thank you for that.   The meat platter was quite alright as well. Since this was a home delivery I can't comment about the ambience. But on the phone they were really courteous and we'll mannered so that was great.   Bellandur generally is a bad place for any sort of food but this place stands out as one of the good ones so I would definitely recommend this place for delivery.
1.0,"Visited this restaurant on a weekday evening... And below is my experience :  FOOD : Quality of food is not that great for the price they charge. This hotel needs to have some good cooking ovens so that they can serve some hot food. Eating a cold and a rubberish stretchy paratha isn't so interesting.  AMBIANCE : Good ambiance however the AC doesn't work. When requested to switch ON the AC, the staff has no clue what to do.. ""NEED SOME GOOD MAINTENANCE OF THE SETUP""  STAFF & SERVICE : Well, the working staff here need some serious education and table manners. Please make a note WATER & Tissues are to be serviced without the demand of the customers. It was TOO ARROGANT of the waiters here to get the finger bowl and the bill even before we finished our dinner. .  In short, it was a worst experience... Would not recommend this hotel."
2.0,"Sorry for the poor rating Punjabi Times. I love your food, but you need to sort your online ordering. After finishing ordering (I consciously negated other options in the list, as I wanted to order only from Punjabi Times) I get a call back from the restaurant that I need to make a minimum order of Rs.800 for home delivery! I guess that's utter bull****! Firstly, you need to clearly mention the minimum order limit (whatever amount it is) before one puts the order. Secondly, you need to have someone who can converse with customers politely. Thirdly, if you can't deliver in an area, you need to make sure that your name doesn't appear in the freaking list. That's all."
1.0,"Had been to this place on a Saturday for lunch, the place was not crowded, we were welcomed by some strong disinfectant smell. The vegetarian menu is very limited, and of the 3 choices of shorbas, only one was available. Starters were limited too. We were really not impressed with the food, also the service was pathetic. Just not worth the price. Avoid this place if you are looking out for some nice ambiance and good food."
4.0,"Amidst heavy showers and my mandatory birthday treat we decided to hop out the nearest place to curb our hunger and frustration. Such a sophisticated place with a guy on mike reciting old melodies and mughalai cuisine on our plates. It was a gamble paid off well.  Try butter chicken, sindh-e-gosht and of course Budweiser bucket."
3.5,"Punjabi Times is located in Bellandur, Outer Ring Road. I have been to this place twice for the lunch and found it pretty good. They serve North Indian food, have decorated the place on Punjab style theme and  plays bollywood music . Food had good taste with variety. We ordered starters, different curries and roti. With that we ordered lassi and Veg sizzler which was quite tasty. Overall - This is a good place to try out tasty Punjabi food."
4.0,"Accidentally landed up to this place twice,  Located in Bellandur, one of the most crowded but happening It corridor of Bangalore, this place has got the location advantage for sure.  When you enter the place, the ambiance is something which doesn't go unnoticed. Have visited on Sunday evening and found a live Karaoke performance, so cannot comment about it on other days.  Now coming to food, the food is good. Me being a vegetarian ordered Chil Mil subzi, its something different which i would recommend to try; a perfect mix of chick peas, rajma and cootage cheese. In breads section chilli cheese naan is something different one can try here.  In Beverages you can try sweet lassi, which is descent. Overall its a nice place to spend a fine evening with your friends and family.  Read my other genuine reviews here :: indibites.blogspot.in/2016/05/punjabi-times-bellandur-bangalore.html"
2.5,"I took my team there for a couple of back to back meals. One dinner and one lunch. Our experience is here:  1. Food: The ala carte menu is good and we had some amazing starters during dinner. Servings were fair and the taste was awesome. If it was just this food, I would have given them 5/5 though its a bit expensive. Lunch buffet was decent and the fish was exquisite.  2. Service: A HUGE NOOOO. During dinner, I had to actually ask one of the guys if there was some extra money involved for him to not be so rude. He was literally dumping / throwing the food into the plates while serving. He stared back at me and walked away! We had some trouble asking for orders as well since no one was keen though a couple of other people came after 8:30 or so and then this part improved. Rudeness of waiters continued. During the lunch, since it was buffet, we did not have to face the same problems though getting the ""chaat guy"" to put some extra masala in the dahi puri was a real big task and his facial expressions showed that the extra masala would possibly result in the restaurant going bankrupt.  3. Ambience: Great. No doubt. I head an interior design platform and my entire team has interior designers and architects and they all loved it. Special applause to the singer singing the old Hindi songs during the evening."
3.5,"Went here for an office lunch. Good food and affordable, what more can one want? Nice, quiet ambience and the location is perfect. A good choice for buffet lovers. the punjabi times seemed a bit overpriced as compared to the quality of food. But all in all, an okay experience. Would I visit again"
5.0,"One of the best places to come and enjoy authentic Punjabi cuisine. All the kababs made her remind you of the north. The butter chicken, Biryani and the also the entire aroma of the food is authentic and really well made. Most punjabi places in the city do have different intonations of their food even if its punjabi, but this place keeps it real and authentic.  Even the ambience and service of this place reminds you of similar places in delhi/punjab.  Must try the chicken shorba, Ralway Murg and Bhatinda murg.   Keep up the good work, me and our team keep visiting occasionally!"
4.0,This place is situated on top of the icici bank near central mall. It offers delicious punjabi food with live music. The service here is pretty decent and interiors  are well done. The nonveg starters and gravy were awesome. Didnt try veg gravy and starters but according to my friemds it was decent to.. this place is good for a team lunch or dinner with family.
3.5,"The best thing which I liked about this place was the singer who was singing retro songs. Amazing! The food had a good punjabi taste and starters were yummy too. Nearby to offices in bellandur, one can go for nice quiet dinner. There is a pub in front of the restaurant too! :)"
3.5,"Punjabi times was a back up option just in case we couldn't get a table at the Tipsy Bull which is 1 floor upstairs. The ambience of the place was fairly decent with nice mellow lighting and spacious seating arrangements. One thing which we found ridiculous was the air conditioning, or the lack of in multiple areas which resulted in us changing 3 tables after 5 minutes each. It may be a temporary glitch and to their credit the staff was very accommodating in getting us alternate tables.  The food and service was very average and the portions of the main course left a lot to be desired. But as the line goes, ""Itne paise mai, itna hi milega"" !! The bill was a relief to the eyes and I can think of atleast a dozen other restaurants in a 5 km radius who would charge you twice that for exactly or an even lesser experience.  Finally, would want to recommend this place purely on the experience of the live music being rendered. The singer's talent adds another dimension to your experience, especially in my case when it was catching up with friends from school."
3.5,"Booked a table for a family dinner... family wanted north Indian food...  Located in the service lane just before central mall @bellandur. They have a dedicated parking...  We ordered some starters and a few mains... *Tomato Soup: was pretty okay... thought it would be creamy.. *Paneer Tikka: Soft Paneer cubes, quite tasty.  *Khumb Te Bhutte: really well chargrilled corn and mushrooms... quite tasty... *Vegetable chili mili: spinach based mixed veggie gravy... pretty good *Dal makhani: Creamy and well made dal. *Garlic Nan and Rotis: well made rotis and nans ...   The ambience was pretty good... with lots of punjabi motifs and symbols around... is a nice fun place.... they have live karaoke singing and the artist is quite talented...   The service is quite okay... we had to keep asking for water... being the only customers there and firsts ones to arrive... they did not seem very interested in serving us well..  :(   The food was good..  the ambiance is great... service leaves a lot to ask for.."
3.5,This place has beautiful interiors and the food is fine. The desserts here are an absolute delight..be it Mango Phirni or Badam Rabadi with Litchi. The latter is a must try. The service is a bit slow and I feel it is a tad overpriced given the portions and taste they serve.
2.5,"The rating is for the experience we had recently . On 6th me and my husband visited this place . Ordered tangdi kebab, naan , panneer lajawab and pineaple raita. The rest of the meal was fine , in fact good but the issue was the chicken tangdi kebab. They were raw. When we asked them to be replaced, noone even bothered to say sorry , The matter of fact attitude was not at all acceptable. We aksed to cancel the order and they just went ahead and cancelled without even an paology fron the waiter or the manager"
2.0,Its ambience was good but not the food. Service was really very slow... You have to call 20 times fro one request. It is a bit noisy also....
5.0,"We happen to visit this place just by chance, it's situated on Outer Ring Road in the same building where Glassy is there.. And it was a well spent dinner time with friends with live music of our choice.. We gave a list of songs to singer there and he sang all those old melodies song for us and made our dinner time beautiful.. Food is yummy as well :) a must visit place.!!"
1.0,"OMG cant get worse than this.....one of the most pathetic restaurants I have visited in last one year. The music is soooo loud, u cant sit cant talk and when u request to reduce the volume, the staff is so rude. I wished i had never visited this place as even the food sucks."
3.5,"The place is situated on the outer ring road in the same building and floor as glassy and below tipsy bull. We stumbled upon it as tipsy bull was full that night, and ending up having a surprisingly great time here. The menu is exhaustive with all kinds of north Indian curries and breads (tandoori roti naan et al) The food was authentic sans the south Indian touch. I had a veg curry suggested by the staff that had baby corn, mushroom and capsicum. It was okayish. Had a good time here overall. PS- They had a guy singing retro hindi songs on the Saturday night. Set the mood nicely. They also have an option to suggest songs."
2.5,An upscale Punjabi restaurant in the Sarjapur area. Decor Punjabi Times leans heavily on faux rustic elements like Matka enclosed lights set on the wall and the unique use of glass bangles on the ceiling to cover random loops of lighting. Punjabi pop and ballad through strategically placed speakers sets the mood for your evening. The seating layout is cleverly designed and can double up as private sections if you are doing a group booking.  Food Bhatti da Murgh is tender and served as a substantial portion. Other staples like malai khofta  was soft and delectable. Nothing extra ordinary usual normal food though  We liked the inclusion whole wheat garlic naans in the Roti section and wish many other restaurants in Bangalore would follow suit. Drinks were pathetic Lassi and some aam paana  Souvik Chatterjee Shivam R Eragon   1st may 16
1.5,"Food was not fresh, especially the chicken. Tandoori chicken was old and pre heated, sheekh kabab was hard and dry like a stick without any spices. If a person is paying 1000+ for the food for two, atleast they could have prepared fresh one. Only the ambience was good. Not sure how people opt this!! frustrated with money and appetite loss."
4.5,"This place deserves more than a 3.5 rating it currently has. The only thing bad maybe is the location where it is situated. Had it been situated on the 100 Feet Road, I am sure people would have been going gaga over this!  1. There was this singer who was performing live at the place, singing Bollywood songs from the 50s!  2. We ordered a Lahori Chicken and a Mushroom dish both of which were extremely good!  3. The view from the 3rd floor was good too. We could see the outer ring road from the inside."
4.5,"Tired of eating south indian every day? Try north amazing north indain food here, typical real good tasting punjabi food and the atmosphere takes you to punjab and there is no doubt about that tandoor platter is here is just mouth boggling and cooked to perfection. the service is fast and the ambience is real great."
3.5,"Had been to this place for a team lunch. It started off with a total disappointment as the AC was not in working condition on that day!!  And there was just a single fan that they arranged to compensate for it. However I must say the important part, the food was good!  Not many varieties but whatever was there was pretty good. How I wished the place was not just as congested as it was that day not just the place but so were the plates. Tiny plates were all that was there.  Chaats-good Starters-good(the fish bread item too good)  Main course-roti, biryani good Desserts- good!  Good experience except for the air conditioner issue"
3.0,"Average ambience, Punjabi look, relatively new place 7/10 Service - Waiters have not been trained well enough, food was cold, taste just about alright, Variety of food was ok expected of Buffet, basic of napkins not provided, water has to be called for, Hygienic yes, 6/10 Enough parking available Total cost - 595(Includes taxes for Lunch on Fri afternoon Will I go there again - May be/may be not"
4.5,This is one of the best places to have authentic punjabi food which is surprisingly delicious. The waiters are professional and provide good service. The place smells refreshing. . Evening time with the lighting makes it a very beautiful ambience. All the paneer dishes are extremely delicious. Overall loved the place.
4.5,"One of the few places that serve good food around Sarjapur and Bellandur. The place has a sophisticated and authentic touch to it, and is very comfortable and laid back too.You can enjoy the live music it was awesome. I particularly appreciate the keema kaleji, nalli gosht tariwala, murg bhatinda, and Punjabi chicken fried rice. Good food. Good Service.Must visit again."
3.5,"The ambience is great and depicts the Punjabi culture. The music reminded me of Delhi/Punjab. Coming to the food, we ordered lassi, shikanji, paneer tikka masala, pindi chole and garlic naan. The food was decent. Paneer was well cooked, the gravy was thick and tasty. Chole were spicy and tasted authentic. Naan was awesome. The service was also good.  Food - 8/10 Ambience - 6/10 Service - 8/10"
1.0,"Pathetic service, confused servers. We were a group of six and occupied the tables at 8.30pm on 17-Apr-16 and it was occupied half to its capacity. It was a hard time to get the attention of the manager to place the order for appetisers and soups. Appetisers were served after 30 mins but there was no sign of soup. The soup arrived with the main course at 9.45 pm, more than an hour late . The restaurants seem to be running low on spoons as even after repeatedly asking for spoons,we couldn't get it.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone,a lot to improve on the service.  Food - 7/10 Ambience - 7/10 Service - 2/10"
4.5,Variety ambience cost are all perfect. Staff is very cooperative. Taste is better than average as good North Indian food is difficult to find in Bangalore. Desserts need to be improved in taste n variety both.
2.5,Hi I visited this place in evening and ordered punjabi combo. Though they said 25 minutes they ended up taking 45 minutes for the order to arrive. After that I have to wait quite some time for getting the bill too. Food also was ok not so great.
4.0,"The ambience is beautifully set. Service was really fast and prompt. Seating is quit comfortable and pleasing. We ordered sarso ka saag and makke di roti which was good.Best drinks are lahori shikaji and lassi. The desserts were an absolute treat to my sweet tooth. The gajar ka halwa and the hot gulaab jamuns were really good ! :) Overall , a must visit place in my opinion."
4.5,This is one of the best places to have authentic punjabi food which is surprisingly delicious. The food comes in good portions thus everyone is satisfied. The food came pretty fast and the waiters were doing their job well and the place has a good ambiance which is really pleasant and appealing.
4.5,This place is good for clubbing on the weekends. Awesome place to hangout with friends too.  The food here is good. Especially the fish fingers. I liked it a lot. The music was awesome too. The waiters are professional and provide good service. The place smells refreshing. The place is kept upto expectations.
2.5,Not a place for fine dining.. Can be tried with friends..  Food Okay Service : Bad Ambience : Okay
4.5,Situated in Bellandur this place is the best Punjabi restaurant in the area. I love the buffet here. It has a lot of items on it veg and non-veg including chaats and refreshing summer drinks such as chaach and jal jeera. I loved their chicken starters it was very authentic. The view from here is pretty good so make sure you ask for a table by the window.
3.5,Best Punjabi Food in the vicinity. I have visited then for Lunch Buffet during the week and loved the decor and ambience. Seemed to be very popular with the nearby office crowd. The staff are courteous and accommodating. Loved their chicken dishes and the corn fritters. The Lassi helped us to neutralise the spice.                                                                 lifeisavacation.in
1.5,"Being here for the second time base don my 1st time awesome experience.  But to my surprise second time exp was worst then I cud have imagined.  Starting from manager behaviour to bill payment.  Pros: The only pros is the food is good.  Cons:  - Manager should know how to speak with people.  - No coordination was there , some says u order chat and we will get you in the table, then on doing that another person said you need to go there and get it.  - When all these happened and we are ready for the bill payment, a guy came with some offer fr discount n all for that we need to dwnload there app. And they were not ready to take money and we felt that they are forcing us to do so. And finally we agreed to do that but again another surprise our machine is not working. And they told this after 30 mins of our argument on that app.  - Finally I get the cash from ATM and I asked the manager to give me the feedback form, and again to my surprise he replied as ""Sir we do have feedback form and thanks for visiting us, do visit again"". Felt like asking him do u really understood what did I just asked you."
2.0,"Such a worse experience over the service. Thanks to quality of starter which cover up for the service. We planned a team dinner of 40 + people and these people made it so bad experience. No proper arrangement, start from ambience, bad smell, no power back up. Only good part of team dinner is starter ( chicken and fish) but that also coming to our table in a gap of 15 mins. taste wise food is good, hope they can do better next time. It's good if you are planning for family lunch or dinner. Please do not plan any team get together over here. Not at all recommended."
3.0,This place has something good in the air! Food was tasty! Live music was played but the service needs a lot of improvement. The staff managed well but negligent while taking order and serving food. At last they gave the bill to my male friend instead of keeping it between both of us.
1.0,The ambience is very ordinary. Definitely NOT a place to go out for Buffet. The food is generally cold. I didn't find any of the items tasty. Not worth the money spent as there are much much better options around Bellandur and Marathalli.
4.0,"Yummy punjabi food. Loved it. The restaurant is very unique in their taste and style. Tasty chola bhatura, makke ki roti nd saag, In starters - Sev tikki and baby corn, and mini samosa were tasty but Panner tikka was hard and did not taste gud. Chaats were gud.. Papri chaat was very tasty. There was Chanch, soup and jaljeera.. Did not try it as was already full. In sweets, custard and kheer was very gud."
2.0,"Been there with family and friends, the place was overcrowded, the pub music was clearly audible and to top it there was an in house singer singing old bollywood songs and man it was so loud (we all got a headache), when requested to lower the volume a little, they turned down the request on the face :), they also do not have an option to shutdown an individual speaker. We were about to leave when the floor manager showed us a place where the speaker was fortunately NOT working and we ended up eating here as it was late and we very hungry. Decor was good, food and service was just average and food is highly priced. This place is now part of our ""DO NOT VISIT AGAIN"" list."
1.0,Ordered food from this place. Food was delivered 30 minutes late. Food quality was worse than a road side dhaba. Packaging was pathetic. Prices for the dishes are too high.  I highly recommend not to order food from this restaurant.
3.5,"I have been to Punjabi times a few times in the past, . one of its pluses is its ambience, the decor is done in a charming way giving a punjabi feel.  There is a live singer singing those lovely songs from the 70s and 80s, and decent fare, all in all ensuring that you visit here again.  My experience here has been a mixed bag, but I always come back .   We started off with a Tamatar Ka Shorba which was nothing remarkable, and went on to starters - Veg Sheek Kabab. Again an OK dish.  But their Khumb dilwale was awesome, mushrooms stuffed with cheese, coated with bread crumbs and fried. Of course not exactly a punjabi taste but can't complain.    For Main course we ordered a sizzler gravy, phulkas and Gobhi paratha. It was all tasty but for some reason Gobhi Paratha here comes with a huge dose of ajwain, which puts a bummer on the taste.    Shahi Tukda, Gulab Jamun and ice cream formed a wonderful finish to the meal.    I would definitely be visiting here again, because the taste provided enough incentive for another visit."
4.0,Tastefully done decor with a nice Punjabi touch everywhere. Evening time with the lighting makes it a very beautiful ambience. Food is very good and so are the variety of options. Both a la carte and buffet spread are relishing and really heavy and tasty. Service is very good too. I like this place.
3.5,"Nice punjabi theme ambience with punjabi music. Starters , main course and desserts were good in taste but variety of the items were was very less"
1.0,"Had been to Punjabi Times Bellandur day before. Tried their Chicken malai tikka kabab and paneer chatpata. While the paneer tasted pretty decent, the chicken malai tikka seemed like it was marinated for more than 3-4 days and was so stale that I almost had food poisoning the next day.  The only suggestion to the owner is please serve fresh and good quality food and you would automatically see crowd gushing in. The pricing is above average and hence people would expect the food to be above average as well."
3.5,"We happened to visit this restaurant for dinner.With a colorful ambience and live music, we pretty much seemed to enjoy.The music was a bit loud though.We had ordered murg tikka alishan and ghost taka tak for starters.Murgh tikka alishan was average while ghost taka tak was quite palatable.In the main course we had palak paneer..murgh pathankot.Palak paneer was average.The amritsari kulcha was very tasty.I would not recommend the cheese chilly naan.Lassi was good.Service was on the slower side.Overall a nice experience.Really appreciate the effort of the singer."
3.0,I am reviewing for veg. Service is good. Ambience is refreshing giving a dhaba feel. Spread is decent. Veg options are limited. There were plenty on non veg options. Hence a veg buffet should have costed less. Not value for money for veg folks.
4.5,Really nice food!!!! True north Indian flavour.. Must try special dishes. Delivery was also fast.  Little bit expensive but amazing taste...
4.0,Good choice in the belandur vicinity.. And the food is true to restaurant name and was nice. The only nuissance was the live music guy who was average and they had speakers at irritatingly high volume
4.0,"The ambience is beautifully set. Their Lassi is to die for. Personal favorite, mango Lassi. All the paneer dishes are extremely delicious. Overall loved the place."
3.5,"We went there for team lunch today, as it is one of the famous one in the Bellandur area which lacks good restaurants. Hence the IT crowd on Friday. The setup is ok with photos of Bhajji and Deols on the walls and some punjabi crafts on the walls. Lighting inside is dimmer. It was buffet that included 3-4 veg curries and 3-4 non veg curries, the names printed and the actual items served was however different. The name read Paneer rara but it was Paneer lababdar, ajwani fish was fish fry, and all the curries were more on sweeter side. They had 1 running counter for chaats and 1 for makke di roti and sarson ka saag. Desserts were apt and drinks included jaljeera and lassi. Food was more on OK side but good for team lunch because of lacking competitors. Price of INR 595 was a bit on higher side for the spread and the quality."
4.5,"Very tasty food and great ambience. Service was really fast and prompt. Seating is quit comfortable and pleasing. Overall, I was surprised finding such nice place in Bellandur area. It was though a little bit costly."
1.0,Pathetic soup.. Late delivery... Items missing... Ridiculously bad food.  Chicken soup with no chicken... My first and last order with this restaurant.
4.0,"We ordered in - V good dhaba type food. All items were very authentic. Heavy food obviously - duh!  Every gravy was different. We ordered railway chicken , tandoori chicken , nali gosht and Lahori chicken - all excellent  The kulchad and nans are good too  Our only complaint if any was that the spice levels on all dishes were a trifle high"
3.0,"The plan to visit this place was not planned and we visited it anyway just to give our taste buds the taste of some delicious Punjabi food. The food is okay. I was expecting some authentic Punjabi food as the name suggests but I am disappointed. Ambience is good, you will get that Punjabi da feel. What I did like is the Masala Papad which was unique in its own way i.e. the Papad was cone shaped and that cone shaped papad was holding the Masala.  Apart from that it was an okay experience nothing extraordinary."
3.5,Not only the place is named Punjabi times but most of the food on the menu is prefixed with word Punjabi. But yes the place does have a hint of the lively Punjabi nature. The interiors are super interesting especially the roof lights decorated in a unique style with bangles. No wonder the food is good for the non veggies but the veggies might be a little disappointed. Don't worry we've the option of liquor available as well.  PS: Don't mind the annoying speakers  sometimes :P
1.0,On 1st Jan 2016 my Family went for lunch. Food is pathetic and taste of food was not at good. If you are fond for Punjabi food do not go to this restaurant
3.5,Came here with 8 other friends for a get together. Nice decor. Nice seating arrangement. There were 4 non vegetarians among us including me.  We ordered a mini tandoori platter (non veg) and murg tikka alishan for starters. Quantity as well as their taste was good.  For the main course we ordered lahori chicken and pathankot murg. I expected lahori murg to be spicy as per the description - but on the contrary it had a mild tinge of spices. Pathankot murg was a little on sweeter side because of the influence of egg and cashew nuts. The amritsari kulcha was the best part of our main course order. My other friends also thought that the service quality could have been better. Prices are decent for the quantity of food served.
4.5,"One of the few places that serve good food around Sarjapur and Bellandur.  *Interiors* - tastefully done *Buffet* - The buffet spread is good and has value for money. *Live song* - During weekends there is a singer who sings old hindi songs, you can place request too.  *Food* - Awesome north indian food."
3.5,A nice punjabi ambience with a nice buffet at affordable price. The no of items in the buffet is less compared to other buffets still a great deal at the price. The food is tasty and there is great no of desserts. They are bit slow in refilling.
3.5,"A decent fine dining place for North Indian food at a good location. Now, I went there with few family members and ordered both vegetarian and non vegetarian food.   Starting with the drinks, drinks menu is at best basic. Nothing fancy but basic drinks that can be had with food. They have a fairly large menu of starters and main course. We tried murgh afghani,  seekh kebab and chicken tikka. All were pretty decent with nothing much to complain, also nothing much to write about. Similar comments would go with the main course. Though, I found vegetarian food to be slightly better than chicken gravy.    Service quality is pretty fine with nothing much to write about. In a city of bars and restaurants like Bangalore, this place becomes an 'also ran'.  Stuck in the middle. Who all should go? A large group of people with preferred North Indian taste wanting to have decent food at reasonable prices. However, if people have time to figure out exact cuisines and dishes, there are better places to dine out at the same price point in Bengaluru."
2.5,"With so many positive reviews down the webpage, won't you give a try to a restaurant which suits your taste bud and budget. Of course, anyone will do. I did too and now I regret it.  I will go with positives and then the negatives.  I asked for a home delivery which was a bit far from their location but they delivered with utmost grace. Kudos to them.  They have their own website for online orders in which many menu items were missing. So, I was forced for telephonic order hence I lost the offer to grab 20% cashback via mobikwik wallet. Dilemma doesn't ends here, in zomato also I was having some offers but my choices were missing there plus the menu card uploaded was outdated. So, I was unable to grab 15% off as well.  Now coming to food, I ordered pudhina chilli murg, chooza shahi kabab and lahori chicken. That pudhina chilli murg, eehhh, it was pathetic. In no way I can label it as a dry item. It seemed that they have dried a gravy item and sent it to me. Since when Lahori Chicken tastes sweet, I really wonder. I can say with supreme confidence that it was butter chicken (quantity was good). Chooza shahi kabab, this was heavenly. Me and my sister loved it, 10 out of 10 for it.  Now you can see that taste in two items were compromised and I ended up paying a mammoth 950 INR!!!This is unacceptable for me :(  I guess they give least priority for parcel items, hence taste was a let down and online orders are also flawed.  1 for chooza shahi kabab, 1 for Home delivery and 0.5 for quantity. So, a total of 2.5 rating I am awarding to this place.  Guys, home delivery is a big NO from my side."
1.0,"Zomato asks us to write a 140 char review about my personal experience with the restaurant. Well my personal experience was so sad that sometimes when I want to get sad, I think about it and cry myself to sleep. I would rather starve than go to this horrible place again. The place is extremely unhygienic and I would beg each and everyone to stay away from this shadowy place. Like Mufasa had said, ""You must never go there Simba"".  P.s.- hakuna matata doesn't apply to this place. This has all the worries you could imagine."
3.5,Lovely ambience with live music. We ordered sarso ka saag and makke di roti which was good. Best drinks are lahori shikaji and lassi.  Overall soothing. Recommended if you enjoy live music ( melodious Bollywood 80s and 90s track) with north indian food.  1600 for 4 without alcohol. Worth.
3.0,Not a big fan of too much Masala in my dishes. The recipes here are a bit high on the masala scale for my liking sometimes missing out the flavour of the meat al together.
3.5,This place was really good when it started but now service and food quality has dropped. For basic vegetarian food say phulka dal and rice it's okay. Starters are a non starter by me at this place. Loved their desserts only.
1.0,Not Worth at all..very poor service by staff..you'll have to keep repeating things unless they wont understand. Takes an hour to serve the food ordered. Food is tasteless. Ruined my day with office colleagues.

5.0,"Last week we went here to team dinner. I found the ambiance absolutely superb with new style. The place has a sophisticated and authentic touch to it, and is very comfortable and laid back too. You can enjoy the live music it was awesome. We ordered for starter -chooza shahi kabab, malai kabab, murg gaulati seekh, aloo tikki, railway gobi. khumb dilwale it was really delicious.  For main course we ordered Murg bhatinda, rogan josh, rara paneer, subz amrithsari, dal makhani that also hot and delicious.It has the most authentic tasting Punjabi dishes ever.  Finally For desserts we ordered moongdal halva. gulab jamoon, badami rabdi THAT WAS REALLY MOUTH WATERING.  Overall good and service is superb, good hospitality it was awesome experience we will go there again and again."
2.5,Food was not upto the level as expected. Less items in buffet. Food:3.5/5 Ambiance:3.5/5 Service:2/5 Quality:3.5/5 Try some other place if looking for puniabi food.
1.0,"Had a very bad experience. The service here is very bad. Food is OK. The air condition was not working. Wen we complained, the staff was nonchalant about it. One of the staff, Rahman was rude to us. Will not recommend this place to anyone. The first thing anyone should consider before hiring is a persons behavior. This is the worst that can happen to anyone, please don't go here these guys fleece you and don't fulfill what they promise."
3.5,"Food is good. Have been here a couple of times and almost always ended up ordering the Mutton sizzler platter (which they seem to have removed now, what a shame). The ambiance is good, but not so much on the food. It looks fancy, but is not that fancy on the taste and texture of the food. Must work on innovative concepts. Come on, we make better butter chicken!  And before i forget - super noisy. Avoid it at all costs if you and your partner are looking for something subdued and relaxing."
3.5,"I have been to this place twice for team lunch and every item that they had for the buffet was fresh, much to my delight. The place is quite small though; if you have a big team and then another team hops in to the place, the place will be congested ! The food is good, and served hot and fresh on the spread. The ambience is a bit gloomy though ! The AC didn't work properly the second time I Visited this place and the place was really over-crowded, so much that there was no place for movement. The service was good enough to save my day and the desserts were an absolute treat to my sweet tooth. The gajar ka halwa and the hot gulaab jamuns were really good ! :) Overall, a good place where you can enjoy a widespread buffet at a reasonable price !                                                                 thefatummy.wordpress.com"
2.5,"Oh boy ! If only I could give it 1 star. Gajar Halwa at the end saved it from that.  Located on ORR near central mall belandur, restaurant is on the top floor. We went there in a group for team dinner and ordered buffet. To start with, the starters were not properly cooked both veg and non-veg. Also the variety was quite less. Service was too damn slow. It took almost half n hour after starters for main course to come (yes that too in a buffet !) Main course was widespread with lot of varieties but none of it made the day better. Then came the desserts covering gulab jamun, gajar halwa and vanilla scoop.  Overall: Food : 2.5 Service : 1.5 Ambience : 3 Value for money : 2.5"
1.0,I had booked the place for lunch for 80. When I reached with my guest the manager didn't know about it. Buffet was not ready and my guest were sitting. Horrible experience I had. Avoid this place for parties. No service. Over rated. Live counter was not ready until 2:15 and at 3 they started telling time is over. Last place to go if you are hungry. Worst Punjabi service and restaurant I have seen in life. Rubbish food. Service utterly bad. AVOID this place. Please. Get good value somewhere else. They may promise you lots but will not get even 60 percent of it. Horrible and bad!!!!
1.5,I am not sure as why the special instructions written while ordering from Zomato are not considered. This has happened multiple times. I need to talk to both restaurant nd zomato for the resolution.
3.5,The ambience is really good and the food is just above average. The food is over expensive for its taste. Had gone there twice but found better options in the neighbourhood.
4.5,"This is the gem of Bellandur. It has the most authentic tasting Punjabi dishes ever. I particularly appreciate the keema kaleji, nalli gosht tariwala, murg bhatinda, and Punjabi chicken fried rice. It also serves good liquor. None of these are very costly. I love this place."
5.0,"We opted for the buffet. It was a good choice. We didnt regret it. The shorba, raitas, pickles, etc. along with papad was a separate counter. Main course was separate from starters. I especially loved the aloo mutter with naan. Superb combination the dessert counter is also great. Especially the jilebis :D :D"
4.5,"A word about the dcor it is as homely as it can get amazing stuff here the food is also truly Punjabi the service is fast youll find whatever you want at a price that is very reasonable try the thalis, they are great!"
4.5,Walked into Punjabi times for quick buffet and did not regret it.  Must highlight the fact that every food item on the spread was fresh and hot. Surely they take care of their quality as well as service.  The pricing of the buffet was very well evaluated and the spread was well worth the money. But i was really overwhelmed with the hospitality there with the owners.  Good food. Good Service. Must visit again  Overall Food: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 Ambience: 4/5 Value for money: 4/5
4.5,"My colleague and I were rushed to get back to work. So we ordered the thalis. I had the Maharaja ranjeet singh thal and she had the Rani roopmati thal. So we both got to taste each others too. But its hard to decide which was better. Both were equally good. Paired with our Classic margaritas, the meal was awesome."
4.0,A really good place for the typical North Indian buffet with really nice spread including chats kababs makke ki roti sarson da sag methi k parthe etc
4.5,"We had the Chil mil pulao. It is a very authentically prepped dish. I have had the original recipe, so I can vouch for it. We then tried Keema kaleji and Achari machchi tikka. Both were pretty good. For a twist, we had the Shahi dahi bhalla, which is one of the best I have had in recent times. Cheers to PT!"
4.5,"We were in here for a quiet drink. No better place, I tell you. The music is never too loud. The staff is kind and helpful. Lighting is not too bright either. We had the Tawa murg sizzler and Murg tikka alishaan. We ordered a Bud bunch of 4 beers. We had a good evening. Not to mention, cost effective!"
4.5,"This place is a boon for Bellandur. We dont have to think twice if we are craving Punjabi cuisine. This place is as authentic as it can get. We had the Palak papdi and Suhana baingan bharta with Multi grain rotis. We loved the palak papdi, it was crunchy. We tried the Mango phirni, which was good too."
4.5,The dcor is truly Punjabi. people love everything about here. even the seating is like a dhaba-style. The buffet is one of the best ones Ive had in recent times. It has all kinds of dishes. And it is not at all costly. Wont burn a hole in the pocket. I would recommend it..
5.0,"I come here whenever my family is in. they love the food here. this time, we had aalu makkai sev di tikki, murg galauti seekh, kadi pakodi, multi grain roti, amritsari kulcha, and cheesy chilli naan. As usual, my family loved it. For dessert, they tried badami rabdi sang litchee. It was pretty awesome. Kind hearted service and not so expensive prices happy happy!"
4.5,"Im a huge fan of the starters here. my favorites are: Phirangi sabji tawa dry Pudina chilli murg Gosht taka tak Dandi kabab Paired with good old Blenders pride, the evening was a great one!"
2.0,We had an below average experience on a Sunday night. Went there for ambience but the lighting was very dull and so was the sad songs that were being played the entire evng. Food was nothing great just your average stuff and also it's very pricey!
4.5,"My khaas favorite here is the Patiala peg. We get it during the happy hours! Along with it, I have murg tikka aalishaan or murg galauti seekh it makes the evening very changa! Punjabi music is played most of the time. it makes you also feel like getting up and dancing!"
4.5,"I didnt know of this branch here. anyway, its good to be here. the place is decorated nicely. The waiters are good. The recommended dishes would be Punjabi chicken fried rice, tawa murg sizzler, and dal makhni. The parathas are very good too. I would recommend this place to my friends."
4.5,"When in confusion, choose the buffet! The quantity is unlimited and the price is not at all expensive. All the dishes that you need to try will be on the buffet with description. There are varieties of raitas, salads, meats, and curries with rice and rotis. Not to mention the elaborate dessert counter, where they fry the jilebis and all. A great choice if you want value for money and good varied quantities"
4.5,"If youre in the area, this place should be on your must-visit list. The ambience is classy, more dhaba like. The service is warm and kind. they recommend the dishes in case you dont know what to order. We had the nalli gosht tariwalla, makkai roti, multigrain roti, paneer de soti boti, and dal makhni. We tried the shahi chawal ka kheer and were super impressed. All the dishes were good!"
5.0,"I was in with my friend. We are both voracious eaters. Hence, we go only to those places we can afford easily! ;) We get huge quantities at lower prices. That day we had railway murg, keema kaleji, murg bhatinda, cheesy chili naan, and Punjabi chicken fried rice with pan surprise ice cream. We also had some mocktail, which I cant remember. We had a great meal anyway!"
4.5,"We went for the buffet. I mostly go for it. Because it has a good number of dishes. Also arranged very nicely and informative tags. My favorite part is the pan ice cream. Really love it. Nice ambience, truly Punjabi. visit at least once!"
4.5,"For starters we had Murg galauti seekh. It was good tandoor. Then, we had the Amritsari kulcha and Makkai roti with Makkai shimlamirch paneer. The quantity is good, almost filled to brim. Hardly had any place for dessert, but still made some. We had Moong dal halwa and Mango phirni. Both were awesome."
1.0,"One of my bad experience with food is associated with this place. Since this place was near to my office and buffet was within our budget I planned for a urgent team lunch to this place.  all the expectations for good food started to vanish once we started tasting the food. Soup we made them to reserve as it was cold. Chicken fry were smmmmmellllllyyyyy, never in my life I ate that smelly kind of chicken. A disappointed team lunch"
4.5,Tried the Fire on the rocks and Orgasm cocktail. Was great. had with Palak papdi. Was crisp and delicious. Murg bhatinda is yummy. Punjabi chicken fried rice is a variety. This place is value for money and time.
5.0,We were here one evening. The dhaba like ambience is alluring. Music is mostly Bollywood. We had the murg tawa sizzler with chil mil pulao. It was truly Punjabi. Also liked the paneer cheesy roll and chilled Budweisers!!
4.5,"We were entirely exhausted after our hectic day. As soon as we entered, we were welcomed very pleasantly. There were few tables free. The place is a little crowded. Probably because of the awesome food. we had the dal makhni, achari macchi tikka, and pineapple raita with butter naan and chil mil pulao. We finished with kheer and badami rabdi sang litchee. In drinks, we ordered Moscow mule, Salty dog, and Black Russian cocktails. My colleagues loved the place and want to come back soon!"
4.0,"We had a great meal. Started with Chil mil pulao and Makkai wadi di sabji as well as Kadi pakodi and Makkai roti. My favorite was the chil mil pulao. My fried loved the kadi pakodi. Ive heard they have buffets too. Would like to visit sometime for that. Nice music, nice place, nice waiters!"
4.5,"This place isnt expensive at all. You can have a meal with burning a hole in your pocket. I always take the buffet if I come for lunch. My extreme favorite is always railway murg, subz keema masala, and Punjabi chicken fried rice. I had the jilebis and moong dal halwa that day. I loved that the jilebis were hot and crispy! Keep it up!"
4.5,"I was only here because I live close by. I thought Id experience something new. I wasnt wrong. Loved the place. Its ambience is truly Punjabi. Next, I had the Island on the beach cocktail, and my friend had the glassy special mocktail. I liked mine better. We had baby corn tilwala, paneer cheesy roll, and tandoor bada platter non veg to accompany. By then, we were full :P"
4.0,"Last month I visited Punjabi times with my office colleagues. As the name suggests, I expected some delicious Punjabi dishes and I can say I was not disappointed. There was a live counter for Sarso da saag and makki di roti. I somehow found dining area is small compared to other joints who serves buffet but food menu was good overall. All the items had a little touch of Punjabi cuisine and the ambiance was quite good. I recommend this restaurant."
3.5,"Punjabi buffet specialists, I got a taste of it the second time I landed here. The first time it was past the lunch timings, and this time we ended up earlier than starting time :p Waited for half an hour and then we were given the menu to order. Entering you see elements of punjabi culture everywhere, including punjabi alphabets on walls and one giant poster of Bhajji. Menu is pro punjabi, all delicacies for your delight. Got some masala papad and railway gobi to start it off. For main course, we ordered aloo gobi with phulka which was pretty fulfilling. Got moong dal halwa for desserts, which was okay. All this was okay for vegetarian folks, though I feel like there's so much value for non vegetarians looking at all the mouthwatering chicken dishes. Good service, but then again there were hardly a couple tables occupied then. Some contemporary punjabi music was being played, though I've heard from a friend that they have a very good singer coming over on Sundays, so want to check it out next time. And ofcourse, try the non veg section as well. Being a born punjabi, this place reminds of my childhood and so would definitely come back again."
4.0,Decent RESTUARANT . Last night went with our family member. Veg platter was very good . Mako roti and other dishes are good too. Lassi was a bit salted and immediately staff was courteous enough to change it immediately . Overall we enjoyed
4.0,"The place was closer to our flats. We had a movie to catch in an hour and so we went there to have a nice dinner and the place didn't disappoint. The ambience was nice and the Punjabi in me was happy to see that. We ordered our usual paneer dishes , lassi and chilly cheese naans. Needless to say, we over-ate just because the food was good. Staff is nice and advises you about the dishes well. I think every night is karaoke night there but then we were more engrossed in our food. :)"
1.0,"HORRIFIC experience at Punjabi Times: We had gone there for a family dinner along with a 5yr old n a 9month old baby. Trouble started after dinner; a terrible fire had started downstairs and we were not made aware of that, although the waiters knew abt it. We had already finished our dinner, the music in the restaurent was on full swing n the place was empty except fr 2 more customers. Instead of informing us abt the fire, n quickly settling the bill; these dumb waiters kept us waiting for the bill fr almost 20-25mins, while the fire downstairs was getting worse by mins. Suddenly one of us noticed the thick smoke outside n enquired, but the waiters merely said ""mamuli sa chhota sa aag hai"". We started running fr the door and the waiters, instead of helping us exit, kept saying ""paise to dete jaiye!!"" The stair case was pitch dark with terrible thick smoke burning our eyes, throat n nose. The kids crying n coughing n we somehow making our way downstairs from 3rd floor; finally were able to escape. IT WAS HORRIFIC. We saw 2 fire-engines had come n a throng of people taking pictures of the building on fire. Had we not noticed by ourselves, we would still be waiting inside and ultimately wouldnt have been able to escape with 2 babies with us. Imagine our plight, if the fire would've spread to the 2nd floor furniture shop n then to the 3rd floor rst. with its alcohol stocks n gas cylinders. The place would've simply blown away!! The callous attitude of the waiters was totally unforgivable n we'll never visit Punjabi Times again in our life."
1.0,"On 23th Nov'15, we went for family dinner at Bellandur Punjabi Times, during that time we observed frequent power cut but later we observed that outside of restaurant, there were huge smokes and also road side vehicles got stuck. We asked the waiter for any fire outside or not, the waiter replied '' its a mamuli aag, don't be panic'', within a minute we saw huge smokes and burning gas were coming inside the restaurant and we started to come out. We somehow managed to rescue ourselves. They did not help us anything for safely exit.   While coming down from stairs (totally dark and full of  burning smokes), the ass waiters were following us and they thought that we would not pay the bill and they continuously asked for payment urgently (in densed buring smoke areas, where we could not breath properly).  The Punjabi Times authority please do response: during huge fire incident, which is more important: rescue yourself from fire or pay your bill within fire???   We never expect such kind of apathetic and non sense response rather in such cases, provide proper exit to your valued customers.  I will recommend everyone not to go there in any circumstances. Your life is more valuable than Punjabi Times food."
4.5,"They have this amazing buffet for lunch. Its basically good value for money. If you're not a heavy eater and still want some good variety, I would recommend their thalis. The maharaja ranjeet singh thali is really great and encompasses all that you want to try here. The vegetarian counterpart, rani roopmati thali is also good enough!"
4.0,"Happened to be here during happy hours, and had the Patiala pegs! Wow! I must say, the offer is great! They also have good imported and domestic wines. Loved the gosht taka tak. The kheer is great too."
4.5,Visited with my family the other day. Had an awesome dinner. Everybody loved the ambience. They said it was truly Punjabi. They also liked the service a lot. Never had the pan ice cream before. It was a true specialty and variety.
4.5,I had the raja ranjeet singh thal for lunch. it is a truly royal thali like its name. They have a kebab and two non-veg dishes with roti and rice of the day. They also have an authentic Punjabi dal with it. Raita is awesome n creamy. On different days they have different desserts. Its value for money and taste buds! :D
5.0,"Beginning with the ambience, I would say that it is beautiful. It is very well lit and the walls are decorated well. Next, the food they serve is good and authentic. It is not at all expensive. They also have a bar that serves good liquor. You can even order champagne for special occasions! I loved the place."
5.0,Theres no need to think of what to order here. The buffet is above standard. It meets expectations always. Includes all special dishes on the menu. The arrangement is done very well. Paan surprise is a special complimentary dish with the buffet.
1.0,"On 14th November, i took a parcel from this restaurant. It was Chicken tikka masala for my son. When i reached home....to my surprise....chicken pieces were half cooked and gravey was not at all tastey. This is the worst experience."
5.0,Im a huge fan of the cheesy chilli naan and murg bhatinda. Its a right blend of spices and gravy. Badami rabdi sang litchee is another special dish which is very unique to the place. The ambience is awesome and the service is good. The place is worth every penny spent.
5.0,The place reminds you of Punjab every time you visit. Its a really homely feel. The wall is decorated with Punjabi memoirs. And the food is delicious. I had the rani roopmati thali this time. Its a treat for vegetarians and those who dont want to think too much about what to order.
5.0,"Try the tandoori platter. It has a variety of kebabs. Its the worth the price. The thalis are also a steal for that price. Also, dont miss out the makkai di roti with saag. Its a Punjabi specialty served in great style here. Its delicious and yummy."
5.0,"I loved this place. Will come again. Reason being, the buffet was so good. It had so many varieties and was arranged very nicely. I loved the desserts counter the best. Because of the ambience, you feel like youre back to Punjab. It was a great experience."
4.5,"To be honest, I love the interiors of this place. Very very classy. I had the Punjabi murg curry with some butter naan and loved it. The deserts here are also quite nice. They have halwas of different sorts but I feel Paan surprise is the best! This place is definitely worth a visit."
4.5,"I visit the place very often as I love the liquor and food that they serve. The last time I went, I ordered the Tandoori Chota Platter which is an assortment of kababs. It was slightly overpriced, but it was worth it considering the variety. I also tried out the paneer tikka masala and I honestly feel that it is amongst the best dishes for vegetarians."
3.5,Good quality & tasty food . Price is moderate . Valet Parking available and service is good .  Tandoori items are awesome in non veg and baigan ka bharta is a must try for all veg lovers .
4.0,"If youre a true Punjabi fan you have to visit this place. Came here on a week day and chatted for a long time, so didnt pay much attention to the dishes on the menu. We ordered some simple stuff such as the Punjabi chicken fried rice and some Dal makhni which was yummm! Very reasonable and good quantity."
4.5,"We had an early dinner here and then moved on to party at glassy which is right next door to this place. We opted for aa la carte as we were just a couple of us and dint think you could finish up much. It its a great place for punjabi food lovers. To be honest, I really liked the food here! We tried out the Murg Tikka Alishan and I have to say, it was worth the price. If youre really hungry, Id suggest you opt for the buffet as it contains dishes from the menu and gives you a vast variety!"
3.5,"Last Sunday, I had the chance to be at Punjabi Times with my friends. Before going to the restaurant, I held a not-so-good notion about this eatery. But the ambience and food of this place changed my vision. The melodious 80's songs being sung there along with the supper added to the taste of the food. You have a whole lot of dainty items to choose from both veg and non veg . I ordered their special Punjabi curry chicken and Lahauri chicken that turned out to be just like a mother's recipe. It was truly delicious. Moreover, they served us very well. To add more to the Punjabi cuisine, u can surely have a Lassi after the main course. It was altogether a splendid experience. I recommend u to give it a try at least once."
3.5,"Food quality is good. Not so much spacious. Good Desi dj with drummer, loud music. Customer friendly services. Good place for attending along with friends."
3.5,It was my first visit to this place when my friend decided to settle with a birthday party. Starters were impressive. You can order paneer seek kawab. Main course looks pretty good. Paneer tikka and paneer sizzler are best choices which is also recommended by chef. In the end you can end up catching a lassi. If you had not been to that food which reminds you  of your home than catch up with this place. Beside that service is good and  food is tasty. Give it a shot.
4.0,"I have been here 3 times and i had always satisfactory and pleasant experience here. specially desserts.when you enter in punjabi times, you will simply love the ambiance. It gives you very traditional look. Food is good here and you have all Punjabi cuisines which you can try. specially dessert items, i love rabdi here. Price is little high but worth to visit once.They also have live concert on weekends which is amazing."
5.0,"The first thing that I felt like saying when I entered here was 'Yahoo!'. The place looks great with wonderful paintings and pictures in a Punjabi style. There are replicas of dhols somewhere in the background. Their signature dishes are made with great care and tastes yummy. If you're looking for a great Punjabi experience, yaha hai, yahi hai! :D"
5.0,"If you're a hardcore Punjabi cuisine fan, you must visit this place. They start by treating you with their amazing ambience. The staff is polite and nice. Then they present you with your order. They also ask you if you liked your food. It feels good to be able to give feedback on what you're having. The food is great as well. Punjabi to the greatest extent!"
4.0,"Visited Punjab Times at Bellandur with my office friends and I went for the lunch buffet and it was pretty good for the Rs 600.  To start with the Tamatar Shorba with fryums was pretty authentic. Had papdi chaat which was good as well.  Went to non-veg started and Amritsari Macchi is worth mentioning. Had 3 other chicken starter but they were normal.  On the main course, it had Rogan Josh with the mutton well cooked. Relished it with roti. The chicken Biryani was normal. It had makki di roti, chole baturo but had no room in my stomach to try those.  To end, had ice cream, gulab jamun, gazar ka halua and kheer which were normal again.   Overall its pretty good value for money."
4.0,To be honest I liked the food here.  Also I was amazed by the interiors. We had actually come down for a team lunch and it was worth. I liked the starters specially one potato fry dish. I didn't like some desserts but gulab jamun was a hit among our team ;).  Also live roti counter is also available :)  Overall a good experience. Food 4/5 Ambience 4/5 Service 5/5
5.0,The happiest thing about PT is the happy hours and its Patiala peg! Hehe! Its a very cool thing. The booze makes you feel like a true Punjabi. They have different kinds of liquor. They also serve it very well. Try the very famous railway murg and you'll be satisfied. Tarara! :D :D :D
5.0,"There are some must-try dishes from PT. theyre authentically Punjabi. And you feel the vibe when you have it. The veg dishes are jurnail attack walein di pasand, dal makhni, and dal tadka. The non-veg dishes to try are murg bhatinda, tawa murg sizzler, and keema kaleji. The wheat naan and multigrain roti are specialties, along with the Punjabi chicken fried rice. Be sure to try the paan surprise. Its one of a kind."
4.5,"Head for the buffet if youre too hungry to wait! It contains the choice dishes from the menu. I wish the time could be extended! Hahahahahaha! Just kidding. Nevertheless, it was a good choice. The buffet I sumptuous and not very expensive. Gorge on your favorite Punjabi dishes!"
3.5,"Expensive and food here is okay compared to the rates ... The Buffet is owsum - buttermilk wid d boondis , and starters, desserts are lovely"
5.0,"This place is a treat for vegetarian food lovers! We had the palak papdi, phaldari seekh, amritsari kulcha, makkai shimlamirch paneer, and sprout salad. My special favorite was the palak papdi. Palak never tasted so good! We had the badami rabdi and mango phirni. Both were nice and very Punjabi. This place is also value for money, and Im very happy with the service!"
5.0,"I tried the buffet this time. The variety is good. It is arranged very well. The vegetarian dishes were tried by my colleagues, and they liked it. I liked the non-vegetarian dishes. My favorite was the railway murg with Punjabi chicken fried rice. The paan flavor ice-cream was also nice. Gulab jamuns and jalebis were good too. 4 out 5 for the buffet."
5.0,"The best thing here is that they have good booze along with good food. the food always exceeds expectations. It is not expensive at all too. My month-end ka saathi! :P :P :P they have all kinds of booze. Starting from cocktails to mocktails, you can choose from a large variety. And the Patiala peg is also available. add to it the paan ice cream and youll be happy happy happy! :D :D :D"
5.0,"The thing that I love most about this place is that it stays open for quite a long time. Even if youre working late, you can drop in. when you see the menu, youll see certain dishes which are recommended by the chef. These are truly delicious. This time, I had the murg pathan kot with wheat roti. I had the kheer to satisfy my sweet tooth. This place doesnt cost you a bomb, but serves you well and with good food!"
4.5,"The place looks beautiful. It is like entering a mini- Punjab. They have these beautiful paintings of Punjabi landscapes. They also have pictures of Punjabi celebrities and all. The lighting is nice and wont tire your eyes. Coming to the food, the buffet should be tried at least once. There are so many dishes to choose from. Your head will spin due to the number of varieties and not due to the prices. It is in a very affordable range. 4 stars for Punjabi Times."
2.5,"Went there for a team lunch. The staff was courteous enough. The ambience is quite alright too. They have just one loo and when I went I found a line of men waiting outside. Bit of a turn off.  Now to the food.  Non-veg was fish fry, chicken wings fried, chicken tandoori, chicken pepper, mutton rogan josh, and chicken biryani.  Don't remember the veg options. Actually, that's a lie. I didn't bother to check but the vegetarians were complaining that there are very less options for them.  The starters were quite good barring the pepper chicken. The fish fry was the dish of the day. It all went downhill from there.  The Mutton Rogan Josh was awful. It was an insult to such a lovely dish. It was mutton floating on tomato gravy. And the lesser I talk about the Chicken biryani the more sanity I will retain. It was easily the worse biryani I have ever eaten. I simply cannot emphasize that enough.  They had an open kitchen counter. The makki ki roti was too sour, the sarson ka saag was just bleh, and the chole kulche was extremely forgettable.  Coming to the dessert, the dishes didn't disappoint as badly as the main course. The lassi was thick. The Gulab Jamuns were tad too sweet but went well with the Gajar ka Halwa.  All in all, strictly average.  Will I go again? Don't think so."
4.5,"Our order was interesting that day. It included paneer cheesy roll, pudina chilli murg, gosht taka tak, keema kaleji, Punjabi chicken fried rice, wheat naan, cheesy chilli naan, and amritsari kulcha. It satisfied my expectations. We had breezers and Smirnoff, and finished with the mango phirni, matka kulfi, anad badami rabdi sang litchee. This place has real good value for money, and meets your expectations of Punjabi cuisine as well."
5.0,"It was recently that I got to know about this place. I didnt want to take any chances. So I directly ordered thalis. My friend and I both ordered the Maharaja Ranjeet Singh Thal. Like its name, it is a very majestic thali. It has a kabab, two non-veg curries, Punjabi dal, and rice/ roti/ biriyani. All this is served with dahi and pickle and salad. That day, the sweet served was jalebi. The meal was extremely satisfying and good value for money."
5.0,"Let me elaborate on the food first. We ordered malai methi broccoli and tandoori bada platter as starters. These have a good amount of pieces in them. Then, we ordered the Punjabi chicken fried rice, makke ki roti along with murg pathan kot and dal makhni. These were made well and delicious. For desserts, we had badami rabdi with litchee and moong halwa which were also nice. There was a singer who was performing old romantic Hindi songs. Place is a good one to go with family and friends."
3.0,"It's a great restaurant near my home. Food is awesome. Staff is very cooperative. What I like most in this restaurant is even if you have a full 3 course meal (starters, main course, desert), you won't feel heavy, yet stomachfull :) and one more thingI likedis they give the home dlivery even during heavy rains :) Hmm, now the main thing why I gave rating 3 despite of serving the awesomest food. They have live singer in their restaurant. Singer is very good, has good knowledge of rhythm and music. Songs he choose are also good. But the volume of speaker, oooo mmmyy gggoodd :( It's so loud that you cannot hear at all what even the attenadants are saying. Normally I and my wife goes there and we cannot hear each other also. We wrote in their feedback last time to reduce the speaker volume, but sadly, it'snot been implemented. Their manager personally apologized us, but I'd be happy if they reduce the sound to match with the space of restaurant. Music should be pleasant to hear. In punjabi times it's being too loudy. Because of such loud music, even the attendant took the wrong order. Thankfully when he confirmed with us after some time, that time we came to know that he has taken a wrong order. Also, I personally thank the manager over there who talked to us yesterday (Sorry, I forgot to ask his name). His behavior was very kind and cooperative to us."
5.0,"Went here for my birthday dinner with a close group of friends.. and will remember this one for a long time to come. Everything from the service to the music was A1. The food was incomparable to any other joint I've been to in Bangalore. The cherry on the cake was the live singer, who added stars to the magical evening. Thanks a lot !"
5.0,They have this amazing buffet with a selection of their choicest dishes. Everything beginning from starters to desserts is organized very well. Its labeled and kept so you dont lose your way around. They also have a selection of dahi and salads. The rice and curries remain hot all the time. Nobody rushes you into leaving as well. Thats some amount of money spent very well!
5.0,Let me begin bottom to top. Hahahahahahaha! Because I had the paan flavored ice-cream which I tried for the first time. It had this special paan ka smell which was nostalgic. Like being in hyderaabd and having sweet paan. Hahahah! Seriously it was really cool. We also had maakai aloo wadi chaawal with boondi raitha and murgh makhani. The food was rich and nice. Tandoori bada platter with 16 pieces was also worth it. We feel that we didnt spend much but had a lot of food. overall rating of 4.5/5.
5.0,"We were too hungry to think. So we headed for the buffet. It was a good choice on our part! Haha! The dishes coice is very good. There was kadai sabzi, aloo mutter, paneer tikka, murg lasooni, pulao, and pepper chicken, just to name a few. Then there was a huge variety of dahi and chutneys. Salads were also there. Sweets were also a part of the buffet. Jalebi was my favorite. We had a good time."
5.0,"What I noticed first is the right hand side of the menu! Haha! Typical Indian I guess. But the food is not at all costly. You can have a lot of it. But still it doesnt feel that it burned a hole in the pocket. The place is decorated well. The seating arrangement is also nice. We noticed that buffet was there. But we werent having much time. Next time I have to try the buffet with lots of time. Special mention for Punjabi chicken fried rice. It was a very delicious variety, because we usually have Chinese fried rice. This one was too good. Also, mango phirni was great. Usually they dont make it so well everywhere. Here it was nice. Just a hint of mango and not too much. On the whole, its a pocket friendly place."
3.5,"PARKING & ENTRY - 4/5 - The place has a valet, but they are not very professional. Better to just park close by yourself.   RESERVATION & SEATING - 3/5 - Seating is average. The place has a friendly decor. But they could do much better. Lots of scope for improvement. Reservation should but be required on regular days, but weekend could be a problem.   EXPERIENCE & AMBIENCE - 3.5/5 -  Delivery experience is alright. Food is well packed and doesn't give you a chance to complain. Within the restaurant you really would feel like they could do better. Not worth getting out of your house for, just call the food home.   ALCOHOL - N/A - Have not tried.   FOOD - 4/5 - They make most dishes in the manner as expected. Certain things are well made. The paneer for example is always very soft. Do not order the mutter sabzi,  as it's just mutter in an gravy they have left. Rest of the food is alright,  above expectations.   EXPENSE - 4/5 - The place is not very expensive, and you do not feel cheated for your money. It's comfortable to spend at, and nothing is really overpriced."
4.5,"Just loved the place. Found it to be very authentic Punjabi like it claims. Went with friends, and I'm glad that the staff tolerated all the commotion and noise. Coming to the food, we had murg tikka biriyani, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and pudina paranthas. Ordered matka kulfi and gajar halwa for dessert. Decent food, decent price. On the whole, a rating of 4/5."
4.0,We had been to this place couple of times. You will not be disappointed if you go for their dishes in a-la-carte menu. Everything seemed fine with that. We did try their buffet as well for lunch and we felt a-la-carte is best. Ambience is nice.
5.0,"Omg! Its just like we see in movies! Where ppl sing songs in the hotel and entertains the guests. It was really really good. Live singer is a very good idea. Our table facing outside was nice. I could see the traffic and lights. Very very nice setting up they have done. Tandoori chota platter we ordered. Nice kababs were there. We had dal makhni with methi paratha and shahi tukde. All was good. Or, all was well! Happy with the place :D :D :D"
5.0,"Who wants the foreign liquor when we have our Patiala peg?! I really missed it a lot and rediscovered it here! ;) I had with the make ki roti and sarson ka saag.  I really had the feeling I was back in Punjab. I didnt know there was paan flavor ice cream. I thought it wont be good. :P But when I had, it was tasty. Very good meal I had! :D Coming soon bhai!"
4.5,I had no idea this one existed. Ive gone to the Bannerghatta one and enjoyed myself thoroughly there. This one was also decent. The Punjab ka feel is authentic here as well. Songs and music is soothing and choice is very good. Pricing is affordable. I loved the kebabs especially. Now I know where to go when my friends are visiting!
4.5,Have visited the restaurant couple of times. Have tried both very and non veg. All we tried were awesome. The Lassi was the best which I have found in Bangalore. The ambience is also good and very colourful.
5.0,"This place is a good option to consider if you are looking for a desi meal. Loved theTandoori Murg, which I got my friend to order too, and even he liked it. It went well with butter naans which were well cooked and had a good share of butter on them, unlike a lot of other places which try their best to put as less butter as possible! Lol. Overall, had a good time dining here."
4.5,"Punjabi Times lives up to its name and gives a good Punjabi vibe. Its a very Indianstyle restaurant, with Bollywood music playing, which wasnt too loud, Indian style interior design, etc. The chholebhature we ordered were thick and nice and filling. They have a good variety of side dishes and it was worth the money. Food was good, in general. The service was a bit slow that day, I wish they would speeden things up, especially because most people come to eat here are really hungry when they enter!"
2.0,The food was not good...most of the items that we wanted to order were  not available... Even in one of the dish we found an iron wire ... So the experience was pathetic... Except the ambience...which is very good.
1.0,"Disgusting food ,the service was terrible,ambience was horrible. Let me come back to the food ,tried the buffet here ,big mistake  ,the only thing that was good was the masala papad n buttermilk everything else was horrible.the non veg starters were very bad ,oily ."
3.5,We were here for Lunch and had Buffet. The interiors and decor is distinctive and good. The variety is good and there were enough options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. We were left a bit disappointed with the taste.
4.5,We picked a place in the restaurant that had a good view of the moderately busy street. The lights above us was not exactly what you would call a chandelier in a traditional sense. They had these really pretty bangles all close together on the ceiling with lights on the inside. We had a couple of non veg combos. And also had their patiala peg which was the punjabi way of saying happy hours. Good place to dine.
4.5,Like the name Punjabi times suggests the place has walls plastered with punjabi news papers as the wall paper with photographs of iconic punjabi idols such as Harbajan Singh and Milkha Singh. The restaurant is beautifully decorated in a traditional punjabi way. They had live music and the guy had an amazing voice and had sung some beautiful Kishore Kumar songs. I had a combo which was the gosht tikka sizzler. It had good portions and a decent variety on things in the combo. For dessert we tried their speciality which is paan flavoured ice-cream. Dint know ice-cream came in that flavour. It was very nice and a must try in this restaurant. The food was a lot like what I would have in Delhi.
4.0,"Awesome ambience, recreates a Punjabi theme. Abundant variety. Starting from Chanch, Shorba, 5/6 varieties of chats, roti of your choice. Even Paranthas, all served at a live counter. 3 varieties of non veg starters, 4 types of veg starters, gravy - two types each for veg and non veg ( which I could not have as gorged on starters a lot). 3-4 types of sweets and ice cream. They end the ordeal with tea seed in earthen pota. Wow... Loved the ambience when we went with team Sep, 2015 beginning."
4.0,Really liked the buffet. Went for a lunch and was really impressed by the service. Hot tawa rotis served along with punjabi genre chickens. The interiors are unique but not extra ordinary. The sitting place needs renovation. Overall good place to visit. Food:4 Service :4.5 Ambience:4  Overall: 4
4.0,"When we reached the place and saw the crowd we were glad we made a reservation even though it was just two of us. The place is jam packed. The hostess showed us in. We opted for the buffet. Too many choices in a buffet often confuse people where they land up just tasting everything rather than savoring the taste and enjoying the food. They had a good number of dishes and yet it wasnt overpowering. It was just right. We tried to have as many dishes as possible they were all delicious and we particularly like the biriyani, the butter chicken and their tandoori chicken. They had authentic Punjabi flavors to it."
4.5,One of the first things that anyone would notice when they enter this restaurant is that the place is really bright and colorful and has a happy and cheerful vibe to it. They food served here is typical authentic punjabi food. We had gone for the buffet. I found the rates to be really low and reasonable for a buffet spread that s so large. The food was really good and we really enjoyed dining here. I highly recommend this place for anyone who's a fan of north Indian food. You will love it. I love the mutton rogan josh here. It is a must try.
3.5,"I have to Punjabi times quite a few times.. First time I went in the evening its located on outer ring road n easily accessible. Was very very crowded.. Lots of families with kids running all around tha place and a live performance of retro songs by a singer. My first impression was ""oh..oh"" But then we ordered food it was descent..ala carte veg corn mushroom biryani and non veg  biryani. Good food but service can be bit slow. Our waiter was very rude for no reason.. The other staff was friendly though.. Great Punjabi ambience..beautifully decorated.. The next time I went there with office team in afternoon.. There was stark difference..no singer no chaos but buffet food was just not that great.. I guess ala carte is better than buffet here.."
3.5,"Visited with team. Food is good. Live singer is really awesome!! Try it out once. They also let you request for old songs. Can fasten the serving though. Too much gap between starters,main course and desserts. Courteous staff."
3.5,"Went there on Friday afternoon for team lunch and was so glad we had a reservation. The place was full! It was a buffet spread, not sure whether they have a la carte simultaneously or it's during other days or time.  The spread was good, not too much, not too less. More importantly, the food was good, unlike a lot of other places which have a huge spread but nothing worth eating. They have matkas in a corner, one each for lassi and jaljeera. Loved the gajar halwa. And they also serve tea in the end.  The place looks good and welcoming. Only wish they wouldn't be playing the Punjabi folk. It seemed to be the same song throughout.  Have heard quite a lot about their a la carte. Next time probably."
3.0,"I went here after hearing a lot about it.  The ambience is nice, cozy and punjabi. There is live music and the singer sings fantastic.  Now about the food. We ordered a Bhatti da Murg which was recommended by the staff over Tandoori chicken by leaps and bounds and we waited salivating while sipping in on Lahori Shikanji and Lassi which were awesome! We also ordered a Pudina Chutney Paneer for the vegetarian folks at the table.  After quite a while both our starters arrived. Paneer was good and soft but chicken wasn't anything near of what we anticipated! Maybe Tandoori chicken would have been better, maybe not!  In the mains we ordered a Mutton rogan josh and Kadhaai paneer with Amritsari kulche and naan. And yet again mutton was okay and nothing like you get in Chulhe Chauki da Dhaba.  Overall OK and ordinary food for your taste buds."
4.0,"Loved the place. Good food and amazing live music, specially for those who like old songs kishore RDBurman etc . Nominal rates. Overall a good to visit!"
3.5,"This place has awesome North Indian Food and great ambience. They have live Indian  music, so you can enjoy Bollywood songs with dinner. Paneer Kababs and Lassi is good."
4.0,"It's good restaurants. food is good.all are food delicious, special chole bature. The service is good, not bad. A lot of variety. Check out the mocktails!!!!!"
5.0,"Punjabi to the core!  Dal makhni is killer but what is awesome is the buffet spread. I went here with my colleagues and boy oh boy did we eat!! The food is scrumptious. I FINALLY found some ""REAL"" Chhole bhature and Dal Makhni. Came out grinning after hogging on a beautiful spread of desserts. Try it out guys!"
3.5,"It's a good restaurant. Punjabi food is good. I went there on Independence Day to have lunch. The service is okay types, the starters are delicious specially the broccoli methi dish.   Served couple of starters that were not on the menu. So u can ask for such starters ;-)  All in all it was an okay visit. It's a treat to relish the punjabi food."
4.0,"Lip smacking punjabi food with punjabi music is balle balle all the way . Their buffet for 600 on weekdays is very good. We have ordered food from home couple of times and it was very nice. I am surely going back when my cold subsides .   Food: that's the high point of this place. Amazing chicken and mutton starters even the vegetarian food is very good . Their chai which is off the menu is wow . Only miss was the mutton shorba which was not available.  Ambience: regular but that doesn't make it any less a place .  Service: prompt Parking : valet , ample parking place.   Go there for amazing food."
4.0,Ambiance is the first thing to talk about its amazing! U guys are the best! The food try everything it's all different and gives u a treat yeah every single one of the dishes! It's one of the restaurants u have to visit at least once!
5.0,One of the few places in Bellandur that serves truely authentic Punjabi food. The rotis and naans are perfect. So is their butter chicken and dal makhani. A great place serving great food. True value for money
5.0,Awesome place for some great punjabi food. The dal makhani and butter chicken are superb. The kheema parantha is again one of the dishes you shdnt miss. A great great place for simply awesome food. They usually have good deals on drinks for weekdays you must not miss
4.0,"We went here for a farewell lunch. I had a horrible experience when I went to the branch in bannerghatta road. So my expectation was that it going to be one pathetic experience.  Once we entered the place looked neat n tidy. I liked the way tables r placed. It looked really impressive.   The butter milk, jal jeera were placed in mud pot. It was very good drink to start with. Starters were good. I liked fish starters n chicken ones. Veg starters were yum as well.   Main course I had rotis naan n little biriyani. They were ok. Non veg gravy was tasty. Made me eat more rotis.   Dessert was decent. It was good but could have been better..  This Punjabi times changed my perception about their restaurants."
3.0,"Average restaurant. Average food, average service. Good ambience. Average price. Good for a light Sunday night family dinner. And yes, don't forget to try out their paneer buttervala if you visit and like sweetish paneer."
1.5,Food is not at all good......being a foodie I don't suggest . Service is good... We order Dal and ask for little spicy. They put green chillies on top the dal. Spending a money it really waste. We order only varieties of chicken but not satisfied with the food taste.  Worst is green chutney is water have a green colour. After asking for replace .... Still came same. I thought yesterday corriender  was not order. Ambience was really impressive ... Welcome was too good ... Staff courteous is really good. All over family crowd.
4.0,Superb place for punjabi food. Very very authentic. The Live singer performance is awesome. The rotis are kadak and perfect. Just the way i like it. Do try their kadhai options. Real nice
4.5,~ wonderful ambience (Traditional Indian style) ~ family restaurant (mostly) and happy times             with friends ~ live singing performance was the best part. ~ amazingly delicious food.  ~ money is worth spending. ~ Do visit.
4.5,Best North Indian place in Bellandur area. The tandoori platter has real succulent pieces of well cooked chicken in some great marination. The dal makhani is really rich and exactly how it tastes in the north. The punjabi chicken curry is awesome. The kheema parantha and butter chicken are a must try.
4.0,"Food was good, Service was on time   Ambience n sitting is very nicely done Their was hindi songs, It was all melody songs sung by him. He was very good It was nice dinner at Punjabi Times"
4.0,"Consistent taste...good non veg food options... dishes that I tried were all were tasty.. We usually go on Sunday night, that's live music night...they usually sing old hindi songs...good place for family dining..."
2.5,Can't believe they lure people by offering desserts in return of 5 star rating on the spot.But i guess that's justified considering the shitty food they serve.
4.5,Usually I go to Punjabi Times for their awesome lunch thalis.. First time I went  for dinner and the ambience was very soothing with soft live music and to top it awesome food.. Endearing service..very relaxed evening..thank u..
5.0,"lovely reception at Punjabi times. Theme of Punjab and flavors remind me of my favourite city -  Chandigarh. Lovely music, unique cutlery  Will visit again for sure..."
5.0,Amazing place to just relax and chill out with a live singer who is just non stop!!! Food is super fresh and always served hot with a smile on servers face!!!
3.5,"Delicious authentic punjabi food and great ambience! Good service!  One of the few good restaurants in bellandur worth trying. Good ambience too, live music is decent."
4.5,Quality of food and service is very good. Ambience is wonderful and music is really instrumental. Its worth visiting on Friday evening. Good place for family as well as office get together.
3.0,"Tried thheir Buffet last week, decent spread. The kebabs were cold and Makki roti was the worst ever. Makki roti was prepare already and reheated in front of me and placed on my plate, sarson ka saag was not good. Curries were not that tasty, just an average fare. Their Lassi and shikanji was good though, and one boneless tawa fried chicken starter was very good too (forgot the name)."
4.0,Looks like they are getting better and trying to retain authenticity of Punjabi cuisine. My last visit to  Punjabi times was full of sumptuous food with samosa and paratha pizza as surprise elements in starters against trending tikkas and veg kebabs. Lassi was amazingly good and do not forget to ask for pan kulfi.
4.5,Nice food ( spl like punjabi taste) with beautiful ambiance.......Moreover Karaoke adds more enjoyment with  food .. ....try punjabi makhani
4.0,Good ambiance and food. Methi and palak murg was yum. And so was the bhindi masala. The service is good and prompt. We were served with their delicious food on time. Cheers
5.0,Excellant food. Excellant service. If you are looking for punjabi food then its a must visit.  We tried paneer panjabi sizzler it was more than satisfying both quality and quantity wise
5.0,One of the best restaurants for north Indian food in Bangalore. Always maitains the same consistency for taste and quality. Great ambience and nice hospitality !!
5.0,The ambience was delightful. The live music made our meal very lively. The food was superb and very filing. Service was excellent. It was completely worth it.
4.0,Nice Ambiance and live music and service is good along with food Nice family outing and there is also request for old songs  The old Hindi songs sung by live singers adds nice touch   Naan and rotis were good. The paneer kofta gravy was little sweet to our taste. Otherwise pretty much other things are good.
3.0,"Average food compared to the quoted price, slow service. I think the music is too loud, it could be a little low. I hope the management looks into it."
2.5,"Cockroach tale...  Good ambience n great live music.. Food choices r limited in mutton n taste is also not exceptional.. The most disappointing part in our last visit yesterday was finding a cockroach in the chutney.. Upon bringing it to their notice, they changed the item ( before I could click a pic) n apologised.. But we were skeptical in ordering further and had just one curry n naans.. Although this is the first bad experience in our numerous visits, the cold reaction by the management team also made us doubt if this was their first instance or not.. As a goodwill gesture we expected atleast a dessert on the house however we just got the bill! N no discounts too.. We did not expect this service from a reputed restaurant.. Doubtful if there ever will be a next visit.."
4.5,Ambience is amazing. Good service too. Enjoyed the food. If you are looking for something desi and chatpata... you are in the right place!!!!
3.0,On a nice Saturday afternoon me and my friend decided to try Punjabi times. She had tried the place 2 years back and at that time she loved the food.  The ambiance was pleasant and inviting.  We ordered the following :  Chicken Biryani: The chicken seemed overcooked and dry. It was served with Raita. Overall not at all interesting. Lassi: Amazing lassi. Perfect taste and served in a nice earthen glass. Sweet and salty Lime: Too sweet for my taste.  Overall experience was pretty average. I will not try more dishes there again as there is too many restaurants and giving another chance to a very average place seems like a waste of time and money.  I have giving this place a Generous 3/5 only because of the inviting ambiance and a glass of cold delicious lassi on a hot day seemed heavenly.                                                                 foodzillaweb.wordpress.com
3.5,"Very vibrant ambience with great Punjabi music... But the food was not very impressive... Though the service was quick and friendly, the  mutton biryani did not taste good at all. Even the chicken kabab we ordered was not cooked well... Disappointed with the food..."
4.5,Excellent ambience .. been there with family .. whole family had a nice time with karaoke playing in back ground ... Excellent food and friendly staff ..
4.5,Good ambience and great food. Loved the concept of karaoke singing to accompany the food. The singer in rhe restaurant was very melodious. good option for family outings.
5.0,"Food was awesome, service was very fast .Really happy with the ambiance. Nice ambiance. Worth of price.Overall really nice place to have a lunch over here."

4.0,"Came here for a team lunch, and we tried the buffet. Pretty authentic food with flavours of Punjab. Live counters for Makke da Roti n sarson da saag stood out.  Desserts had a good spread too especially the Gajar Halwa.. If you are in Bellandur or ORR and wanna try out some good Punjabi food, this is the place"
4.0,The ambience is very good n soothing. Food is excellent n service is superb.... The songs played are lovely n voice of the singer is very melodious..overall a very good experience n vll sure recommend my frndz..
5.0,Awesome food....nice ambience...great service...:)
4.5,"I am a regular customer of punjabi times. Must say the food was beyond my expectation. Service prompt and the live music is something that would set ur mood just right .   Food -5/5. Must try chatpata paneer tikka, aloo Makkai sev tikki and makkai ki roti/ sarso da saag ( not usually available in the south ) . The Punjabi pickles from Amritsar is yet an other attempt to mesmerise ur tastebuds   Ambience-4.5/5  Robust ethnic rusty and yet sophisticated. I personally like the concept of lights inside the bangles and of course the punjabi khanda.  Service-4.5/5  Prompt and very quick. Must say personal attention and their proactive skills have earned this rating   Not to forget is the live karaoke performance where the singer with his 90 s tunes just makes a night to remember. We were also offered a complimentary paan stick at the end .   Definitely gonna visit again ."
4.0,One of the best butter chicken. Reminded me of Delhi's taste.. Really humble staff and good service.. Ambience is also nice.. Must come when you want to taste good north indian food..
3.5,Great ambience... Good service... Had come with friends for the lunch buffer... Good food options... Tasty food.. Worth coming back again....
4.5,Such a delicious food and hosts! North indians head for it. I dont miss my pandara food any more. Well well and well. There is one guy Kuber and he should give fee lectures on hospitality to many other places in bangalore. Enjoy food and live happy !!
5.0,Excellent place. Great food and ambience. Very friendly staff. Reasonably priced.  BTW: There is a guy here who sings old songs of your choice. Wonderful voice. He also invites you to take the mike and sing if you so wish.

4.5,Been here for dinner. Unique punjab experience in Bangalore. Awesome food and very prompt service. An evening well spent :) recommended for punjabi food lovers!
5.0,"Awesome experience of lunch today, food is very good and taste of north. Manager is too active for the services.sweet dishes are pure Punjabi style. Rate 5"
3.5,"Relive the old times with old and gold songs sung live at your request , its the best part about this restaurant . Food is good with north indian flavors, service is awesome with special attention. Last time I visited I was offered gulab jamun as complimentary. Happy to visit again and again this place."
1.0,"So this is my second review about this place within a few minutes....... My first one was pretty decent. I wrote bcoz the staff asked me to, but what happened next was simply disgraceful. The manager comes down and asks me to take out the review since I had wrote about a particular dish I didn't like. Now, that is sumtin I cannot take. So I am Neva again stepping in here as they do not know how to treat their customers. The murg bhatinda and the shahi tukda was just horrible.  My opinion for the money they charge you shud definitely go sumwhr else than eating here. Absolute nonsense this place is. I write this with great displeasure and hope people know what this place is all about.........complete rubbish!!!! Only good thing here is the live music and the waiters courtesy."
3.0,Excellent food and ambience. We really enjoyed the meal and extremely courteous staff. The tandoori chicken was the highlight of our meal...
4.5,"Have been to Punjabi Times many times and every time the food is delicious, service is good, live music just adds to the nice dining. Being a vegetarian this is one of the best place where all veg items are good. Rabri here in dessert is a must try."

4.5,Good service... Live singer honoured our music requests. Must visit for authentic Punjabi food. On ordering food waiters were generous enough to suggest stuff we would prefer and quantity. Overall great place to visit especially if you are old music fan.
2.5,I felt it was little pricier 280 for appetiser and as compared with the long name of dishes chicken leg pieces were very small. I felt the live music was very loud. Those who are not a fan of kishore kumar and old music would not feel comfortable. Service was quick. Not sure why i felt the food turned cold even before serving. It took us a long time to find the place glass house which is next to punjabi times because of no clear directions by the staff. But we changed our mind and visited punjabi times due to its branding and visibility. We were told that they don't serve drinks when we asked for cocktails which is not true. Tried sizzlers and appetizers we felt it was too less quantity for the price of 350 or 280 Service: 3 Music: 2.5 Walking Space: 2 Ambience:2.5 Suffocating AC:2 Location:3.5 Visitors quality: Family restaurant  Restroom:1 Pricing: too high for the quantity Staff: 3
3.0,A well decked up place with some good punjabi food. The food is good compared to many other North Indian restaurants in Bellandur but is not consistent. The food is a little better than average.  Food: 3/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Value for money: 2/5
5.0,"Being from punjab this place reminds me of my home, Dal makahani and bundi ka raita, mong daal halwa are awesome here. Not to mention the great taste of chicken pathankoti and chicken bathindi  Go here for awesome and authentic punjabi food.  One more stuff the ambience super awesome must go and u will come again and again"
4.0,A great place for North Indian / punjabi food... Paneer is very soft... Love it... Don't forget the lassi and chicken tandoori starters... Great going punjabi times.. :)..
3.0,Pretty average place with above average pricing. The kheema roti is exceptionally good. The kababs are just about ok. The pricing is a little too much for the quality of the food that they offer
5.0,One of the best places to fulfil your Punjabi cravings.... Chakk de phatte... Every thing gives a feel of authentic Punjabi dhabas..... Love to be there always....
5.0,Awesome place .. Luv the food luv the ambience and after all it's my best hangout place  Luv being here and the dishes are fabulous.. A regular customer and always wanting to visit Punjabi times
5.0,"One of the best food & ambience , The only authentic punjab in bangalore is "" Punjabi Times ""  For north indians - Come here to cherish your home memories For south Indians - Come here to feel how & What the Punjab is .   Bon apetit...Cheers !!!"
5.0,"I have been a regular visitor of this place. The ambience, service and the food totally takes you back to Punjab. Be it the starters, the Thande Ras or the main course everything is amazing. I personally like the Murg Galauti Kabab and Tandoori Murg. So if you are a Non Veg Buff, this is the place to be. The Service staff is very courteous and well mannered. So i would suggest this place if you are looking out for nice North Indian style food."
5.0,Love the Decor; Love the Ambience; Love the Drinks; Love the Food; Love the Service; Love the Servers!!!  Do not forget to try  pan-icecream!  Deserts are their speciality try it ..!
3.5,This is a decent place for non veg food though nowhere compared to Chandigarh food ;) Whenever we want to have simple n sober food( roti n chicken curry) we go to this place. I tried their buffet once but did not like it much.
2.5,"I have tried this restaurant a few times, mostly delivery, with the hopes of getting something good atleast once. Honestly, the only good thing after ordering thrice was the seekh kabab. The daal, chicken cury, butter chicken etc are not at all authentic and the taste lacks any original flavours.  Coming to the only good thing which i liked, the seekh kabab were nice, the texture was smoother than i expected it to be but taste was better than most seekhs you get in the restaurant in the same area. Online ordering was hassle free and the delivery was hassle free.  Service -.5/5 Ambience - NA Food - 2.5/5 Value for Money - 2/5"
1.0,They cheated us on the name of buffet they blocked us for 2 hr and served only 12 items including every thing. They served us on table. They are not at all punjabi. Don't go there !!!! Gajar ka Halwa was not fresh and AC did not work at all.
2.0,"This is the second time we were visiting this place. The food is OK, however service was slow. The Musician was good, but the overall effect was poor considering the room to be small."
3.5,"Visited this place for a team lunch. As the name suggests the look and feel of this place has been given a Punjabi tadka. We opted for the lunch buffet on offer.  We started with the shikanji and some chats. Shikanji was refreshing. Chats were also good.  There were three non veg starters and three non veg main course dishes. Mix of chicken, mutton and fish. There was egg curry and chicken biryani as well.  I tried the rajma chawal which wad very good. There was makki roti and sarso saag also on the offer and bot to forget the lassi.  Didn't concentrate much on the deserts. Music played was perfectly matching with the Punjabi folk songs. Service was great. There was also tea towards the end.  Overall we enjoyed the place. Most importantly food tasted good though the spread was not big. Nice place overall."
2.0,"We 25 colleges went for Weekday Buffet and the food is pathetic and not even hot. Biryani is the poorest to be rated followed by the veg/non-veg starters. Desserts were better not to be mentioned, so as the live chat counter and paratha counter. Overall the quality of food is below average, so as the service."
1.0,"We order something but got different to eat. Ordered cola got lime, ordered boneless Chicken got with bone. Taste isn't great. Wouldn't really say it was value for money. It's expensive for the experience and taste that was experienced."
4.0,"Great food, especially dal makhni was really good. Completely punjabi style, which only a dal makhni lover like me will understand. Service was good. But, quite a costly place."
1.0,Those idiots refused to take sudexo coupons even when it's written that they accept it. And the waiters were so creepy that they were staring at the female friend with whom I went throughout making us uncomfortable. And to add to it there was a power cut so we had to eat dinner in darkness.
2.5,"A really overrated place with awful food. The ambiance is good and that is where all your money is going to go.  We were 3 people and were really hungry. we ordered veg platter, one curry and naan and everything was a competitor for being worse but Veg platter won. i remember there was 2 big boiled , unpeeled potato with some stuff put inside, and even the stuff inside was not eatable.  There was a guy trying to sing there and my roommate sings better then him, overall experience was really bad. The restaurant is within 500 meters form where we live but we could never collect enough courage to visit the place again."
3.0,3 star quality food at a 4 star place with a 3 star service. Overall average food in fancy plating and overfancy decor.  Taste - 3.2 Ambience  - 3.5 to 3.8 Service - 2.8 Vfm - 3.0 to 3.2
2.5,Their Bannerghatta branch used to be my favourite place for Punjabi Khana when I used to live in that part of the town. I was so happy to see that they had a branch in Bellandur when i moved here. So when i went there the first time i ordered their kababs and butter chicken as usual but was in for a surprise. The meat in the kababs was very rubbery and when we complained they did change it but the new one was as bad as the old one. The butter chicken was a little sour than usual but was not bad. We did go there a couple of times more but the food we found is very average compared to their Bannerghatta road outlet.
4.5,"Excellent Excellent Excellent ! Went their on my birthday and it was one of the memorable ones ! Ambiance : Good, liked their colorful lighting with the bangles on the ceiling. Given Punjabi touch with Dhol and Matkas but most noticeable was Diler Mehandi and Bhajji huge Pics. The best part is their Live Singing night. Its great for people like me who like Old Hindi songs. They even sing on requested songs. It just made my birthday more special ! Service: Good Food: Good, Their starters, Main course and even the deserts were good ! Nothing extraordinary but good.  If you like the live music then you will enjoy the place else over priced."
5.0,"Updating review from 3 to 5.  I have been here so many times that I can't count because of its proximity to my home. After being sure that its not worth a visit again, I didn't visit this place for almost 2 years now. Yesterday, I couldn't find la carte option to dine in at a restaurant opposite to punjabi times and just ended up visiting this place again.  Though, the waiting staff is as lost as I knew earlier, the management was lovely. They replaced a dish that was mistakenly written as tawa chicken sizzler instead of tawa paneer sizzler, almost without a question while the waiter told us it can't be changed as he had repeated the order. I am sure there was a confusion and i wont blame him or us for that but it happened. We were ready to eat the chicken too as we do eat non veg but the manager was so cordial. In fact, he even came later on asking if we were Vegetarians as he was feeling guilty. The good was above average, ambiance was wonderful all because of this beautiful singer who was a treat to the ears with his live performances. I can go back to this place again and again for that alone. Left me and my spouse so happy to be sharing that quiet moment and singing together at our table! Hmm.. recommended for dining any day when u r not sure where to go but need to go!"
4.0,I have been to this place twice.. The more recent one being for a lunch buffet.. Food quality was pretty good and the staff were really courteous too.. I would recommend this place for good food if you happen to be around Bellandur..
1.0,"Very bad delivery service. Ordered twice and both times it took 2 hours to deliver food across the street. Called them up and no regret and kept saying on its way, on its way. Will not recommend to anyone. Food arrived cold. Avoid at all costs. Unprofessional and lack of basic customer service. AVOID."
2.5,Ordered some home delivery - few roti and one 2 curries - 1 Paneer and 1 Mutton. Roti was OK. but both Paneer and Mutton dish were much below par. Especially mutton pieces seemed to be striped off of the meat - only bones with cartilage left. Smell is not good also. Overall it is not a good experience at all.
3.0,Ambiance is really good.. I live opposite to this place :p .. Punjabi flavor lingers around your taste buds... but doesn't satisfy you to the fullest.. Maybe they cater to the larger crowd...the staff is courteous.. food arrives on time.. but doesn't pull you to go there for a second/third bite
2.5,"Expensive for what they offer in terms of taste and authenticity! The place is no where close to authentic Punjabi food. Seekh kababs are extremely extremely average when you notice that they are supposedly known for ""exceptional kababs"". The main course is actually below average when you compare with their own starters. I would rate 4/5 for the ambience and about 2/5 for their food. Overall an average place."
3.5,The buffet is good and had lot of variety in each dish like starters/main course/desserts. Good option for a corporate team outing. Only negative is the music they play. Such a horrible playlist!
2.5,The food is not as great as it is expected to be. The one on Bannerghatta road is about 10 times better than this branch. Im not sure if they are a franchise or owned restaurant. The thing is you expect food as good as the brand and the ambience but that isnt the case. The only good thing about this place is their offer on drinks!
3.0,"This place is quite nicely decorated, but the sad part is the food. It isn't that great enough for the price they quote.  Had a veg platter. Nothing was super good, infact i found gauva/apple tandoor which i didnt enjoy any! Others were okish (sheekh kababs, some paneer stuffed mushrooms, baby corn tandoori) The main course was also average, nothing so great. Had mango lassi and this was good.   Would not prefer this place again keeping in mind the cost!  Also the service was bad, it took ages to serve the platter and main course, and especially with my kid, i found it quite annoying. They had live music, but the sad part is we got a seat just next to the singer and we somehow found the volume to be high! may be we might have enjoyed if it was a far away seat..."
3.0,"Typical north indian food that we found in most of the places. Oily and spicy and that traditional thick gravy where you need to fish out chicken or paneer. Very very average taste. Over priced and after vat and service tax and service charge it becomes a lot of money on pocket for an average meal. The ambience is OK, nothing great. Service is slow."
3.5,"I would highly recommend this place for a good dine in. They have live music to go along with the punjabj food. The staff is courteous and humble. Even though the starter was ok, the main course made up for it. I specially liked the pindi chole. The ambience is good and the service fast. Thumbs up.!!"
3.5,"Good food luv the chilli cheese naan there,have trief both ala carte and buffet, lunch buffet can be a litttle better. Nice ambience and one of the better places for dinner in bellandur and sarjapur."
3.0,Decent okaish place. The stuffed paneer was delicious. And the chicken curry was average. Actually less than average..There are so many people around you when they serve and they just dont leave the table..!
3.5,"We went there on a Friday evening after office for drinks and dinner since they had an offer on certain drinks. The offer was fantastic considering the amount our team usually has. We ordered for their veg platter and the tandoori chicken. The veg platter was good and we thought that the tandoori chicken was a little overcooked and burnt in certain places. Nothing that we couldnt manage. For main course we ordered butter chicken and rotis. The butter chicken was average, nothing compared to what you get in amritsar or chandigarh. Overall an average place which is a little over priced. would go back once is a while for a lazy office outing"
3.5,"This was my 2nd visit here. The first one was disappointing one so thought of giving this place another try. The ambience is good. Adequately lit place with live karaoke singer. About the food, it is moderately priced. We had the babycorn with til for the starter . it was crispy n yummy with some chat masala on it n with green mint chutney that compliments it very well. For the main course we had tawa paneer sizzler( which is a curry ) with kulcha. The quantity of the curry was not that great. It is sufficient for 4 kulchas. We also trued the lassi which was good enough. All in all its a decent enough place to go out for dinner"
2.5,It's just an average place with nothing special about the punjabi thing. The dish we ordered was either too sweet or lacked flavor. I would prefer other punjabi type restaurant to this one if I wanted to have north indian food.
4.5,"Great place. Weekday buffet is really awesome and the makke di roti stand is a must visit during the buffet. Good spread and good options for both veg and non veg. Wide spread of chats, starters, main course, rice and deserts! Great ambience, weekdays are generally dominated by office crowds from the near by IT parks! Must visit place!"
1.0,"Food tastes OK but the price is not worth the meager quantity they provide. The hotel service is bad. The hotel management is stubborn and when we asked them to lower the AC temperature, they didn't do that...!!! There is also a hefty amount of tax to be paid without getting any service. This shall be the the first and last trip to this place."
1.5,I went to the Bellandur outlet. The food was good. But the service provided was not good. The didn't finish our basic requests like turning down the sound of music player or turning down the a.c temp as a.c couldn't be felt. Moreover the quantity of sabzi was very less not at all proportionate to rate. In addition to taxes(service tax and VAT) the took 10% service charge for I don't know why because all this rates should be included in the prize
1.0,Worst Service ever. They are applying 15% service charge+service tax then also no Service. And yeah Music will be totally noisy. Food qaulity and qauntity was not good at all. I do not recommend this restaurant for punjabi food at all.
4.0,if you can enjoy food with out ambience and forget an oil free diet for just one meal this is an experience you must have. The paranthe are something else.
3.0,I found this place very average. Whether it is in terms of ambiance or food. Went there on Sunday evening. They had a live music going on. It was more of noise than music. Ordered Tawa Murgh Sizzler. It was all what was described by the waiter but taste was very average.
3.0,Seriously if you want to pay 5 star prices for normal punjabi food ..i would recommend go to katari in btm or gyani da punjabi dhabhi or uncle da punjabi dhabha in silk board..hideous pricing and taxes.  Food quality is ok.
2.5,"I had been to their Banerghatta outlet which was very good in terms of taste and service so thought of going to bellandur's restaurant which turned out to be total opposite.  Order : Daal makhni, subz amritsari , amritsari kulcha, naan and zeera rice.  Taste : Daal makhni was not at all tasting like it should be. It was way overcooked while subz amritsari was not cooked to the perfection. Amritsari kulcha was having the stuffing of  Paneer fried in zeera which was pathetic , naan was not hot and zeera rice were  ok, nothing fancy  about the food.  Service was decent but the best part was the live ghazals which were par excellence. The singer was a replica of Kumar Sanu ;) cheered up the mood.   As far as food goes especially veg they need to improve a lot !"
4.0,"Wonderful place where you can hangout with friends and family. Team lunch was organized at this place from my office. Friendly staff and they served variety of good food. Started of with aloo tikki, samosa, chole-batura. Had lot of option in main course and deserts were the best part of the lunch. Great guys. I would love to visit again! :)"
4.0,I order in from this place and food is always fresh. I want to highlight the sarson ka saag...had today with makai ki roti and it was awesome and very authentic. Will need to be a regular order going forward.
2.5,Nothing great. Had the non veg thali and hardly any non veg to the dish. Decent niece but will need to improve on the food especially the corporate Thalis. Good luck.
4.5,"Went with colleagues for lunch today. Dinning area has good decor but feels little congested as there is very less space between Buffet counters for main course, chat counter and dessert counters. Now coming to food, I started with Laasi (salted), Paneer Tikka, Butta, Aloo Tikki, Amritsari Maachi (fish) & Amritsari Masala Papad.  Lassi was really good and had authentic punabi taste. Paneer Tikka was perfect and paneer was tender and soft. Aloo Tikki was ok in taste. Butta (Corn) was nice and bit spicy. Dandi kababs were really good, cooked to its appropriate amount and i haven't seen such a good presentation of Amritsari maachi (fish) was really nice and was melting in mouth. Amritsari Masala Papad, formed in the shape of cone.  The best thing I liked about this place is that it has live counter for main course and had authentic Punjabi Prantha, Sarson ka Saag (Mustard Leaf Vegetable) and Makki ki Roti (Corn flour bread) with butter and Gur (Jaggery).  I had following things in my main course: Dal Makhani was really great, one of the best i have ever had. Aloo Prantha (Stuffed Potato Bread): Taste was good but could have been great. Sarson ka Saag (Mustard Leaf Vegetable): Test was great with butter. Makki ki Roti (Corn flour Bread): Test was awesome but was not properly roasted.  After this I was totally full but after having such a good food it was worth giving their sweet dishes a shot so had Jalebi, Rasgulla and Sawainya Kheer. All three sweet dishes were finger-licking good.  Service was good and staff was courteous.  Food- 9/10 Service- 8/10 Ambiance: 7/10 Value For Money - 9/10  This is place is quiet decently priced and full Value for Money. I will definitely like to go back and taste other veg varieties available in Veg Buffet."
4.0,"A well established name, here on the busy roads of bellandoor is Punjabi Times, easy to catch coz it is facing the ORR only. So, u enter this place & are surprised by a soothing early hindies song playin, but wait, its a singer singing those great oldies on request. Yea, first thing I did was to request a song to be sung (attached foto :)) , alryt, business talk : this is a 4/5 ambience place & I am not just talking about the bangle jewels chandeliers, or wall hanging bowls & glasses making the map of Punjab, but, the attire of waiters too. Food : Keeping the essence of being a Punjabi alive (:)), we did order, daal makhni & lahori paneer (with cashew gravy) along with rumali roty, butter naan & lacha parauntha. Quantity : Daal was just enough for 3 people, meanwhile paneer was on a bit lighter note. Quality : Daal, I believe, is the criteria for a restaurant/Hotel & this 1, stood like a warrior in my view, meanwhile paneer din't have that cashew punch, 1 wrd : mediocre. They do have double-to-mrp drinks, but we din't order any poisons. Overall, it did cost us 900 for 3 people which is more than reasonable. Ps : the service is little slow, So, dun make it a quick-meal-spot, rather, plan some good quality time, amidst the live songs & overwhelming ambiance. Defo a 1-time-go. -Dw"
3.5,"I visited this place with my colleagues. It is a nice buffet style restaurant. As I am not that familiar with Indian food, I like this type so I can try many things.  I liked the chat, it was really tasty and not too spicy.  Although my colleagues thought that the variety of food was not wide enough, I think I could try a lot of things and it is true that I already ate better, but still I think this place is a good option.  In such restaurants it is very important to take away the dirty plates in time, in this area there is room for improvement."
3.5,They have lunch thali which I have had a couple of times. Their el a carte selection for veg folks was good as well. I have been here couple of times with office folks and with family. Decent choice but a little on the expensive side for the food they serve if you go for the el a carte. Lunch thali was well priced. Overall it is good.
2.0,The worst ever experience from Punjabi Times. We order almost every week and it is almost double the price of any other North Indian in this area!! lol! We ordered today and paid almost 1k for the most shitty order ever! Never going to call them again! The mushroom in cashew nut gravy was the most hopeless. Dal Makhani which is usually 4/5 was actually 2/5 today. Better is to order from Aangan in this area. It is much better Value for Money from Aangan and it is probably 60% cheaper as well!!!  Punjabi Times - you have lost it guys!
2.5,Food quality and taste was average. There was a stinking smell in the atmosphere. Ambiance was fine. Music was quite authentic. I would avoid the place in future.
1.0,"This place was rather shandy. However, since we had made a reservation,w e decided to give it a try. And What a mistake was it ! The place was not well maintained, the plates dirty and the manager seemed busy in everything else than looking into these complaints. He seemed to be working like an usher, getting new customers to their tables and then vanishing.  In fact the complaints from all customers seemed to fall on deaf ears.  Cockroaches seemed to have made this place their home.  We decided not to risk our health in this place."
2.0,"Having high expectations from this place, it was a big disappointment.. Started with Railway Chicken which was too dry & chewy.. Moving to corn potato sev tikkis which were in reality bland boiled potatoes with a coating of nylon sev The ultimate test of patience was tiranga tava veggies which took more than 45 mins to cook and to our surprise were tava sauteed veggies.. All of this being Chef recommended on the menu & the justification for the delay in serving was due to high number of parcels to be delivered.. They must start paying attention to the customers in house rather than concentrating on home deliveries.."
4.0,"To satisfy my big hunger for some desi Food visited this place, though the rating is low but still the ambiance seemed nice so went there to have my first dinner of 2015. First of all the dinning area is really good and too comfortable, some 4 different seating sections, with slight modification to the decor. i won't say the decor was kinda unique but ya really good. Nice karaoke was playing with some old( really old) Bollywood songs, singer did justice to those songs and was quiet soothing. They had a special menu for the 31st - 1st which contained very less option to choose from, that was a bit disappointing.  Now coming to food, Started of with Sweet Lassi, Dandi Kabab and cheesy Paneer Roll. Lassi was really really good really thick one. Cheesy Paneer Roll was a bit tangy i didn't understand y, but was fine. Dandi kababs were really good, cooked to its appropriate amount and i haven't seen such a good presentation of Amritsari Masala Papad, formed in the shape of cone and stuffed with certain vegie's.  Now Main Course - Punjabi Paneer tikka- really nice flavors, cooked properly nice gravy just the paneer wasn't soft enough but good. Dal Makhani- seriously gr8, one of the best i have ever had. I usually don't like makhani but this was something really really good. Dal Tadka - good, homely taste. They did real justice to the breads initially they served a cold one after just informing them quickly replaced it. The Amritsari kulchas and Cheesy-Chili Naan were really good. After this i was totally full but after having such a good food it was worth giving there sweet dish a shot so ordered Badami Rabdi totally worth it.  This is place is quiet decently priced. Neither low or too high a VFM place. The only thing i didn't like here was the service which was quiet slow, though the staff was courteous but SLOW.  Food- 4+/5 Service- 3.5/5 Value For Money - 4.5/5 Ambiance - 4/5.  P.S. This place is a total thumbs up, worth Visiting again. Definitely deserved 4+ but less than 4.5."
3.5,Punjabi times is one of the nice places in Bellandur area. Loved the chuza tandoori and other non veg dishes. Cottage panner was really tasty.
3.0,Called in delivery - dal makhani was good. Butter chicken was good too..rotis were lousy however nan was edible. Plan to visit the restaurant soon to sample their starters
1.5,"I went for dinner with my family, being close to my place we decided to try it once. But i feel it is the first and last time for me. Though they have tried their best to maintain a punjabi theme, but the food is not upto that mark.  we had to wait for atleast an hour to get the food served. Servers were not even willing to attend to you even if you call them, they were only interested in passing the buck to the other one. Another annoying thing is the Music, Live music what they play was too loud that you can't even talk to others. even after requesting to lower the volume by many people, nobody from the staff seemed to be bothered about it. Finally we were so annoyed that we have to leave the place without having the food properly with not so good feelings.  For the management: Please try to improve your service, people are not willing to wait for an hour to get the food and not all people are interested in listening to your music, please play it loud in the adjacent pub."
3.5,"This is one of those places that i like to visit once in every month (as it has become expensive gradually over a few years) with family and also with friends. The best part of the this place is that it is near my place and in comparison to the restaurants, of the same cadre, its quiet resonable. Starters (veg): the paneer tikka is all that I have tried, being a non vegetarian, and it doesn't dissapoint.  French fries with sauce was quiet good and the sauce was quiet thick which added to the flavor. Starters (non veg): the chilly chicken was quiet good and justified it's category of an appetizer.  The fish tikka was something that exceeded my expectations as i was expecting a smelly dish that will add to the fragrance of the room. It tasted well as was cooked with perfect amount of oil and just the perfect quantity of spices. The mutton tikka was something because of which i decided not to eat any more that particular day. The mutton was not skinned properly and we could literally pick out the skin from it. Main course(veg): the paneer lahori is what i would recommend. The curry was indeed well prepared and had a sweet taste which is recmmended for people who dont like spicy gravies.  The ""sarson ka saag"" (being a Punjabi) is wat i like to have whenever i want to go easy on my stomach and to be frank it didnt disappoint at all. I only wanted it to be a little spicy, which is still ok as it was not like a bhartaa, which most restaurants serve on the name of punjabi dish, and were you can very well taste the sarson and it goes very well with the ""makke ki roti"". Other dishes that i have tried, in veg, are dal tadka, and dal makhni in which i recommend dal tadka anytime over dal makhni. Main course (non veg): the best chicken dish i love here is ""punjabi murg curry and lahori murg"" both spicy, well prepared and light on your stomach.  Pros: great ambiance and good service Cons: drinks are very expensive and they have stopped offering complementary papad and soda with the drinks."
3.5,Another team lunch adventure which turned out to be fun. The fact that we were eating in a punjabi themed restaurant.  The buffet was ok. The buffet was kept in a small place which always was over-crowded. The items were different from the usual buffet spread and it was good as well. The pan ice cream was great.
1.0,"I'm not going to write a review lampooning the buffet and approving the  la carte, because that is the way it is. The buffet is almost like taking a plunge into a rather crowded and noisy community pool, which inevitably ruins your appetite. But in the end, it shouldn't seem so ridiculous: It's a common deal you get without spending an awful lot, after all.  The wait staff - they'd be very busy. Groups of five to ten people collect around the tables, and demand the staffs permanent attention, meanwhile chattering about their businesses as noisily as they chomp, while demolishing in one clean sweep, everything there is to eat.  I will not go over the food they served, because I wouldn't like to remember most of it, but I'm imagining that the restaurant had reservations about offering a wider choice. But understandably so."
4.0,"The place is very colorful, with Punjabi village theme, we went for lunch buffet. the spread is ok ok, as in taste is very good but items are limited in comparison with other buffet's that we see. The exceptional thing here is the pan icecream which we get in seldom, we discarded the buffet desert and tried pan icecream and we all liked it a lot. The paneer dishes are a must mention here, as they are exceptionally tasty. I also been to this place for dinner, and it looked more colorful than in day :)"
3.0,"A team lunch outing in the agenda and Punjabi Times being close to office, we paid a visit today. A decent buffet at an affordable cost. The makke ki roti and sarson ka saag deserve special mention. Rest of the buffet was good, but nothing spectacular."
1.0,"On a sunday afternoon, the AC was not working, and when we ordered Veg food. the Jeera riceserved hadmutton kheema in it. He refused show the kitchen when asked if they had separate kitchen for veg and non-veg. Prior to this incident when i oredered veg biriyani home from the same place, it has a worm in it. I dont recommend this place for vegetarians."
1.5,"i don't recommend the place. it has lost the charm, the place stinks just no maintenance and poor service."
1.0,Changing my rating due to my recent visit. I wish there was an option for negative rating. Waited an hour at least for the food Horrible service and horrible food. Not recommended at all!! Please value your time and spend it somewhere else
4.0,"I bet that it is one of the place which serves an authentic Punjabi food in town. Had been here on a double date and we almost loved everything about this place. The ambience, service, food quantity and quality and what not. I loved loved loved their sheek kebabs. Finding a right excuse to visit this place again."
4.5,"Extremely tasteful interiors and comfortable seating. While I see from photos that the lighting makes the interiors look nice at night, I went for lunch and was still quite impressed; I thought it was pretty ethnic-chic. The coloured glass collage right behind the buffet spread was quite dazzling, too!  The buffet boasted great variety and wonderful-tasting food. While the soups and salads weren't much to speak about, the starters, mains, and the bread basket were excellent - mostly (the Fish starter was a standout!). Right combination of spices and no unnecessary oil. The food refills could have been a bit faster, but still not long enough to complain. Service was prompt and efficient, otherwise. Desserts were good, but I'd have liked to see more options.   I didn't mind paying ~Rs.550 (all incl) for this, but I would definitely think it is costly if I were just vegetarian."
3.5,A good restaurant the decor is indian traditional only draw back of decor is the dim lighting .  Food is good but a bit expensive for taste  Any one who wants to eat north ka khanna it one of the better place in bellandur I recommend dal makhani with butter naan (must try)
1.0,"Probably the worst establishment I've ever been to. As a person born and brought up in Bangalore, I've never written a bad review of any restaurant. But this place was pathetic. Not only was the food bad but the service was equally terrible.  We were made to wait for close to 1 hour for our main course. The waiters gave us some stupid excuses like ""the gas is over"" and ""sorry sir, its a busy night."" Apart for my wife and me, only five other tables were occupied. We started to get irritated and decided to drop it and ask for the bill. At which time the manager comes to us and says ""give us five minutes.""  When our food finally arrived, the kulchas were cold and the Roti's were uncooked. The curry was also cold. I usually have a high threshold of patience, but this was something I couldn't handle. I canceled the order, paid for my starter and left. Nothing is more important in a restaurant than the quality of food and the service. The customer is the most important person in your establishment. The dcor and entertainment should be secondary. The only saving grace at the place was the singer performing live music. Hats off to you sir, for helping me maintain my calm. I wouldn't recommended this place to anyone."
3.5,"I have been to this place for a team lunch, and it was stupendous. The buffet had variety; makki da roti and sarson da saag was amazing. I liked the ambience and indeed would surely recommendit to my friends and colleagues. Overall, its a great placeto havelunch or dinner party. Hence,would like to write thanks to theentire Punjabi Times Team forproviding such an amazing food and service."
3.5,"Virtually scouting for authentic Punjabi Fare on Zomato..we chanced upon Punjabi Times and thought of giving it a shot. We were welcomed with the sweet melody of nostalgic hindi songs, pleasantly surprised to know that it was no tape playing in the background..it was live singing. I graciously donate one point for the singers soothing voice that set the North Indian tone for the night. As expected..the ambiance was typically a scene out of a prosperous Punjabi village. To feed a group of hungry stomachs, we started off with the kabab platter, a mix of chicken, mutton and fish delicacies. The chicken kababs were flavorful, the mutton seekh kababs were a bit too dry but the most disappointing was the Fish, which was just not palatable, we left it untouched. Based on our appetizer experience..we decided to stick on to the safer option, chicken.  As suggested by our host, we settled in for Murg Bhatinda and Murg Lababdar accompanied with some basic Indian Breads. The main course was typical Punjabi fare..nothing to complain about but nothing that excites you for more. Overall, my points are for the decent service (considering the crowd on a Sunday evening) and in keeping up with the predictability of Punjabi cuisine."
4.0,"Its a Punjabi buffet all the way along. I have been to this place for a team lunch, and it was very good. I loved the ambience, the food was good and of course near to my office. Although its not a place where you can go daily to have some. The prices are in the same range of BBQ Nation. I would say go to this place to taste the best of Punjab cuisine."
4.0,The buffet spread and quality of food has been very good whenever I have tried it. I have been here 3-4 times and never have been disappointed with the food. The service is very decent as well. Good value for money.
4.0,Good food. Chicken starters and biryani is worth a try. Overall ambience is nice and different. Not economic but definite value for money. Good option for authentic Punjabi food close to commercial workplaces in Bellandur.
3.0,"As per the atmosphere....the place screams punjabi... not so much on the aspect of food. I participated in buffet(so my judgements are kinda partial) The food was cold and didnt uphold the standard to be called real punjabi... starters were very limited and god help you if you are vegetarian.  Was on a corporate dinner, so didnt try the booze..."
4.5,"Nice interior, food and staff. I went for lunch, from starters till deserts all items were yummy....good place if you are looking for a budget between 500-600 per person including taxes...we tried different things and all were Nice."

3.5,"We went here couple of weeks back for a friends farewell. The place was good, with decent food and good collection.   Cons : The service there was not up to mark. There was point where people started getting their own spoons and disposing their own plates that speaks volumes of their customer service. They had good options for both veg and non-veg but was not worth the prices.  Overall the places was decent , nice ambience, good food but service there can improve a lot and price was a bit on a higher side.  Mukund"
3.0,"Its normal punjabi food , but not so great in name of punjabi food , ambience is good , but overall food is expensive over price. Looking at the area near Eco-space its one of the decent places to eat... as their not much around. Visited in June 2014"
4.0,"Who said that you can't get authentic Punjabi food in Namma Bengaluru! This place never disappoints, that's what I have observed from my five visits to Punjabi Times.  If you are a hard-core non-vegetarian and will always prefer your Butter Chicken over a cheesy Pizza, this place is meant for you. Food quality, quantity and taste, all three are top-notch. Choice of Rotis is tremendous and all the offerings are good.  Ambience is fantastic. Punjabi Times strikes a fine balance here between sophisticated air-conditioned glassy restaurant and rusty, earthy Punjabi roadside Dhaba. The seats, especially, at the very end give you a beautiful look of Outer Ring Road on one side and shimmering bangles on the ceiling of restaurant on the other side. Just to add to this, there is a live karaoke performance on Sundays. The person sings some beautiful renditions of old hindi songs, which go down really well with the atmosphere.  The service is decent enough. Normally, most people would like to have generous servings of water after each bite of ultra-spicy kheema paratha, but the waiter, unfortunately had no clue what his guest was expecting. Other parts are just right. People are warmly welcoming and caring.  The rates are decent enough. If you don't care a lot about your spendings are are genuinely interested in some hearty, filling, desi meal, this is the place to go to."
4.5,"A very good place near bellandur for team lunch or for a dine in with family , Heard a lot about rich Punjabi food but at punjabi time i just experienced it , Went for their Lunch buffet , the spread was not probably the longest in the city but yes the 20 items they had very perfect .....just perfect , very good taste , rich ingredients -like the amritsari machi , sesame baby corn or the butter chicken or the melting panner all very perfect ......or may be i was really hungry at 3.00 after a crazy hot day .....jokes apart perfect 5 for food taste and presentation  Ambience : right balance between bold , soothing and colorful ambience with rustic dhaba feel , and of course the awesome punjabi beat in the background all perfect.  Service - This was the only place where i thought some improvement might be possible ,or like i said it was too late for me to come in at 3 - 3.30 for lunch  Cost - The costing was also very reasonable , for the awesome tasty food and the variety.  Thanq team Punjabi time, for a wonderful experience at your restro"
4.0,"Looking for a place around Bellandur where you can munch on some good Punjabi food?Punjabi Times if your best bet then.Its on the same service road where Bangalore central is located. The ambiance of this place is wonderful with a very royal & colourful feel throughout the place.The walls of this place have writings in Punjabi and gives you that home away from home feeling. The food is delicious while some of the must try things is the aam panna,The missi rotis and the biryani.Yummy tummy food and a great experience.  Rating -4/5 Budget - 1200 for 2                                                                 lohith1509.blogspot.com"
1.0,"I went there with my wife and a friend from Italy because someone told him about the ""Punjabi Times, Bellandur"" so we took him there.  We ordered.  1) Paneer Tikka 2) Butter Roti 3) Rabdi 4) Chana Masala 5) Some gravy Paneer  Good Part:  Haven't come across any.  Bad Part:  1) The paneer tikka had mud/stone particles in it which we could feel really bad and it tasted really overcooked(burnt) from top and raw from within. ( Like cooked on a high flame) 2) The persons service the tables were slow/ignorant and we had to ask them multiple times to bring us rotis. (Pisses you off if the continuity breaks as we asked for chapatis in 3x3x3 but felt like after every 3, we were ordering again) 3) Ambiance was quiet dull not because of the low lightning but the way the aura was there, wasn't pleasant. Good for drinking but dinner, no way.  Overall : Disappointed Rating : 1 star"
4.0,"Nearest food joint to my place so m pretty much regular to this place and trust me its the best option in 5 km radius of bellandur. Lets do what i m here for ... Food: no regrets ever .. Service: depnds on its weeknd or weekday ... on weekend its lil slow but then they serve awesume papad chaat for starter and on weekdays its quiet fast ...  Ambience: decent always quiet with punjabi music on weekends and not much crowd ... clean and good seating arrangements .. Speciality : i have tried almost all nonveg dishes and had tasted some vegeterian as well ... ""u know there is always one vegeterian in group to spoil the options"".. so i would suggest go for regular like butter chicken and tabdoori rotis ... quick input here ... always order a second curry dish like handi , mughalai or something ...  Quantity: depends if u r foodie like me or others ... coz quantity will not disappoint u bt its always good to have option on ur plate ...  Quality : lets say better than normal home delivery curry we order on weekends ...  Now let me give some quick inputs here  Its never full so u can always find place to accomadate ur gang but still be early on weekends but its only decent place other theb one or two to dine in properly for north indian food in bellandur area ..."
1.5,"Explaining you with Use Cases -  If you have allotted team buffet lunch budget, you need to go a close by restaurant in Sarjapur belt, Quarter deadline to finish the budget is coming closer and you are not having any option to visit. Then please book a table in Punjabi times as you will be greeted very nicely in the reception with smiling staffs but once you are on the table you will be pleading for your chance to grab some starters. And if some waiter visits your table they will offer you your choice of kebab in very limited quantity as if you are eating too much and it is injurious to your health, be health conscious.  Overall the butter chicken and butter nan combination was awesome, live counter makai ka roti with sarso sag was disappointing, cheesy potato and Mongolian chicken were good and paneer tandoori was pathetic and rubbery which you cannot expect in a punjabi restaurant.  I complained to the owner of the restaurant and explained him to check his serving manners which is Ram bharose, but assured him that visiting his restaurant is next to impossible now."
3.5,"Good food. I went on a weekday and the lunch had a buffet spread. The food variety was pretty decent for Rs 475 ( plus tax ). The spread consisted of live roti / nan counter,  live chat counter, 2 types of welcome drinks, vegetable curry, paneer,  salads, biriyani, fish, chicken and mutton. The dessert had gulab jamuns, ice cream,  gajar halwa, chocolate cake and firni. Overall good."
4.0,The closest restaurant to office means we regular here.  Good food. Not so bad cocktails. Great service. Ambience is also not bad.
3.5,"This place was a real surprise....the moment we entered, there was a beautiful retro song being played and when that song was over we heard people started clapping.....that is when we noticed it was a live performance.....well then what, we requested some of our choice and it all went awosem. I strongly recommend this place to anybody who loves those classic of 70s - 80s...have good time with lovedonce and can dedicate a song to them as well...and yes food was good as well."
4.0,"We went to this place quite unexpectedly. After checking out a few restaurants on busy Monday, we reached the place with a pretty good ambience and where people there gave us a warm welcome. We opted for the buffet and we were not disappointed at all. They had a variety of starters both veg and non-veg. All the starters were just too good. The main course was decent as well. Then came the deserts which again had surprised us all. It was all a treat to the taste buds. The service was also quite good. In all we had great PUNJABI TIMES."
3.0,"Disappointment !  Went for a delivery order. We had 1 Chicken Rara 1 Dal Makhani 1 Mushroom Curry 15-16 Naans/4-5 Rumaali Rotis  Bill : 1500 Rs.  Chicken was horrible ! at times it tasted raw, uncooked and what not. Dal Makhani was pretty good while the Mushroom was average.  Naans were also not upto the mark. After hearing so much of positive about this outlet, this was a let down !  VFM : 2/5 Food : 3/5"
3.5,Nice ambiance. Sarson Ka Sag and Nalli ghost is always good there. But they are overly priced.  Quality of food has gone down drastically. Yesterday afternoon ordered one mutton biryani & one chicken biryani with sprout salad. It was horrible. Not biryani at all. It was masala rice with three odd pieces of mutton.
3.0,Quite expensive. But kebabs are a must to have.You can go with starters and beer bucket.Dint try the main course.
4.5,great biriyani!
3.5,Awesome food...!!! Keep it up friends...!!!
4.5,Good place for punjabi food. Have been here couple of times. Reservations recommended. Recently they have introduced live chat counter and few other counter which they prepare as per request.
3.0,Visited two times for team lunch and the ambience is quite ok with the Punjabi touches. Foods authentic punjabi and buffet gets you reasonable varieties.
4.0,"I wish all the places we just stop by in Bangalore serve tasty and just rightly priced food. Again I will be commenting only on the veg part which we tried. Saw the board were extremely hungry and so we decided to stop here. basement parking and available on a Sunday eve was a plus point. We got a table for four and because of the current weather were not willing to sit under the AC and the restaurant staff was kind enough to take our order on that table and then quickly arrange for another even in the busy time. My daughter was already troubling me with hunger and so we quickly placed a simple order: 1 Dal fry 1 Wheat naan - I found it interesting 1 Butter naan 1 Butter roti 2 Missi roti 1 Punjabi paneer sizzler combo - interesting again it had something like kadhai paneer and 2 palak and potato rolls, some rice and 2 roomali roti and again one interesting potato tandoored and stuffed with tomato salsa. 1 plain curd 1 mix veg raita  All this costed us around 1215 All Inclusive. They had vinegar onions and green chutney which was also good in taste. Quantity and quality both were good and I surely wanna try some starters next time I go there as they looked interesting to me :) Entire staff was so courteous and warm welcoming that we enjoyed our quick visit there. Service was great. We being demanding ones in this visit also dint trouble them Loved the ambiance soothing one and some interesting art works. I am just thinking how did I miss this place so close to my house. Probably a better board will help as I always thought this to be a bar and restaurant but the pub is separate and the restaurant separate. Over all good experience. Good value for money. Good staff."
3.5,"Very good ambience and service. Tasty food, but quantity of starters and others are very less compared to other resturents. We had to wait for around 10 mins to get two seats."
4.0,Nice Buffet. They have different variety of chats. Non-veg is pretty good. Fish fry is also good.
1.0,"Ordered food two months back and it was not the authentic punjabi taste . It was stale n tasteless.  Yesterday ordered again at 8.50 pm , waited till 10.45 called to find out it on the way... at 11 pm no one answered the call. We slept without food   as no one came with our order. No food n no apology so far.  Pathetic people."
2.5,"What a sad disappointment that place was,  It was a colleague of mine who wanted to treat us for lunch on a weekday, and Punjabi Times, being near to our office, became our unanimous choice.  We settled down for a lunch buffet, where food was served at table. That doesn't really feel like a buffet, but saves from all the movement. Server takes the pain for you.  The non-veg starter contained chicken, mutton and fish. Fish came out to be not well marinated. Mutton kebabs were hard. Only chicken tangri kebab came out to be a good choice.   Veg starters were not that impressive as well, other than the papri chaat.   Proper dismal performance started with main course. Chicken was too spicy. Mutton gravy was tasty, but the pieces were not that great.  Didn't really expect a good biryani there, and they just met my expectation.  Hot gulab jamuns were the last thing to come (before bill of course), and they were indeed tasty, especially with the scoop of vanilla ice cream.  That was quite the lunch summary.  And at this price range, it wont be my strong recommendation at all."
4.0,"I have been to this place twice and the word i would like to use is ""Amazing"". I went there on friday night on both occasions and both the time the food was amazing.  I love their starters both veg and non veg specially palak papdi and murgh malai kabab. they have some unique ways of preparing it..:). Coming to main course we all (group of 8) loved both veg and non veg dishes consisting of Chicken Pathankot and Malai Kofta which is very unique. In desert try shahi chawal ki kheer, you will surely love it although the lassi was very average. The best thing about this place is you can enjoy your drinks with some good food in a very shady ambience. So, my overall experience was good apart from the fact that they take long time for service. And of course, last but not the least it's a bit costly and taxes are too high.  It's definitely worth a visit...:)"
3.5,"When I first wrote this review, food was inconsistent and expensive. But, these days, I am back to ordering (home delivery) from Punjabi Times. The food quality is more consistent and is much better."
1.0,I went here 3 times in my staying at Bangalore.  definitely it Is not  a good restaurant   for non veg people. ambience is very good. The test  of mutton  was horrible.  Gobi fry was  not proper.   Some times I feel they prepared the non veg food with old stocks. I was unwell after eating at this restaurant.
1.0,"Horrible !  Ordered food on Sunday at 8:00 pm ,At 9:30 pm they said your order will be delivered in 2 hours.Seriously ? Who would like that kind of service ? This is the first and last time i will ever look to eat here. Totally disappointing with the service and attitude of the Restaurant here.  Thanks. SIddharth"
3.5,Starters awesome Maincourse Ok Price on bit higher  Ambiance good
1.0,Very horrible service
4.0,"Home style punjabi food. Good ambience, good service. My all time fav. Chicken bhatinda and bhatti da murg. Must try."
4.0,"I visited Bangalore last year and stayed there for around a fortnight. Even though i'm a great Dosa fan, I started missing the North Indian food before the trip was over. Punjabi Times came as a saving grace in the midst of all this.  Most impressive thing about PT is its decor, slightly overdone, but so is everything about being Punjabi ! There are pillars made of colorful bangles, posters of Bhajji and Mehndi, and lots of artifacts which adds to the aesthetic value of the place.  My friend and I started with traditional Chaanch, i.e., salty buttermilk. Post that we moved to the main course that comprised of Paneer Lahori and Dal Makhani, along with butter naan and the chef recommended-cheesy chilly naan. The food was good, probably the best punjabi food i've had in the city. I should not be comparing it to the food we get in Delhi, still I was happy with my overall experience. Would definitely dine in the place again on my next visit to the city."
4.5,"I'm the biggest fan of punjabi times. It has beautiful food, great prices, lovely ambience, friendly waiters. Super yum"
1.0,Disappointed.Chicken Biryani was not good.seemed like rice was cooked separately and hard boiled tasteless chicken was put into it.not worth the price I paid
2.5,"I wrote the review for Aangan restaurant sometime back.  So, I thought let me make some comments on another Punjabi restaurant in the area.  The name is Punjabi Time and is on one of the service roads on the 3rd floor, I think.  The first thing you get an impression about the place is that it is very shady.  But, as you venture inside, you find that the ambience is not bad.  I was quite skeptical before I could put myself into the restaurant.  I think, it was a decent decision.  I still remember that they took a long time to serve the Veg Platter after serving the soup.  I guess they had some problem with preparing the tandoor gobi or the Paneer.  I dont think that the output made any difference as it surely wasnt upto the mark.  I think the gobi wasnt fried pretty well and also the panner wasnt done well.  In terms of the main course, the daal+roti combination I tried wasnt that great as well.   But, the interesting thing is that the place is situated next to the outer ring road so that view very good.  And the restaurant was decently full, at least around 60% which I thought was a big surprise.  Overall the taste was surely not upto the mark.  I guess a lot of north Indian living in and around that area do make a visit 1-2 times and surely its been surviving there.  My rating for this restaurant would is around 2.5 and no more than that. Food - 2.5/5 Ambience - 3.25/5 Service - 2.5/5                                             fodyssey.com"
3.0,"Had gone there for a team lunch. After inquiry over phone, we were told that buffet contains two complimentary drinks. Was a bit disappointed to find out that the drinks were buttermilk and jaljeera.   Starters - Chaat counter was decent. They served bhindi pakodas that day. It was was very oily. The cheeseballs hardly contained any cheese. Paneer tikka was fine. Also served non-veg, but I am a veggie.  Main Course - The spread was good. 2 curries, rice, pulav, salads etc and other typical stuff. Taste was OK.  Dessert - Were good. Gajar halwa was nice. Tried mango firni for the first time. Here also the spread was good.  Good experience. Not a super awesome place but definitely worth a visit."
3.5,"I  visited Punjabi Times 3-4 times last year and it has been more than 6 months for last visit. I was not aware that Punjabi Times started weekday buffet and tried first time on last Friday. Buffet price was reasonable like other buffet options out in market and they had pretty good amount of items to try out. I had to try Veg options but my friends were on Non-Veg items. Veg (specially Paneer) & Non-Veg starters were really good, Chicken starter was simply awesome. Only concern was from starters point of view, 2 non-veg starters served instead of 3 and they was no answer from service team on missing item. Main course was also pretty good with variety of curries, specially chicken curry and Aloo Masala then Deserts gave really happy ending to tummy with yummy Gulab jamun and Pan Ice creme. In Overall, food was really good and worth to try out but what made us so disappointed with this place was service team. They were least attentive to us and having lack of details about missing food items. Starters were served with huge delay. Definitely we can try this place for the food but don't expect speedy service."
3.5,A good value for money place.
3.5,This place has the authentic ambiance of a punjabi restaurant! We went in as a team and opted for the lunch buffet. Lets just say that the Paani Poori was the best I had in Bangalore. Veg Starters were okay and the main course was filling. Deserts topped the charts and were superb. The service can be improved a LOT!!!! Not to forget that the place feels a bit costly compared to the service you get!
4.5,"I went here with my friends to celebrate birthday.. The ambiance was just wow for the event.. Food was awesome the service was excellent and it was right priced . I loved the food . If you are lo oking for the lunch buffet the weekdays . This is the best place with right price and large variety of food .  PUNJABI TIMES ...U Guys rock- Went there aon a weekday for dinner with my team of 18 a must say that u guys did a fabulous job..

3.0,"We headed for a quick lunch there on a week day. The place was decent with a good food. We had ordered non veg platter, it was really good.  Then we ordered some roti and some gravy, all proved to be rich and good. I will visit this place again for a leisurely lunch or dinner."
2.0,"Hello,    We had a buffet team lunch here on weekdays. so i would like to share my reviews with you guys:     I went first time in punjabi times, Bellandur. They have charged 500 rs + taxes per person. I found that varieties in food are    good enough, not less. I am vegetarian so i tried only veg food. But food taste was bad. Really food was tasteless. Even my colleagues those are non vegetarian , they didn't like the food also.  Even i didn't like the place also. Believe on me, it was not looking like the restaurant also.   Ratings in food as per my experience:    Starter: 2/5   Main Course: 2/5   Dessert: 4/5   Ambiance: 3/5  I would suggest to punjabi times, please bring improvement in your food taste in buffet.  Would i go there again and suggest to othe people to go there?  NEVER"
4.5,"We have been to this restaurant 3 times and it hadn't turned us down yet. (because I have faced the problem 2nd or 3rd time about quality in most of the restaurants). Its always keeping upto its expectation with respect to taste and quality. Food is good, tasty and I would say a little above the price, but then you can't do much about it, as its one of the better one around this location. I am a pure vegetarian and have had a good experience till now. Ambience is also good."
2.5,"I have been here 4 times, gets 5/5 for creative ambeince and look of ORR from glass... food is ok-ok, not that great. non-alcoholic drinks are great... specially thandai and aam ka paana and shikangi.... rest is all ok. Not a great food that you will say wow... you expect more for the price you pay... don't go on weekends as food can give you a feel of little un-cooked, some of my team members had stomach upset due to railway gobhi and other starters... not sure if they always serve it fresh."
1.5,Never and ever go for buffet .It all waste of money with not even 1% of taste . Deserts are worst . Think before you go there
4.5,"Amazing buffet spread for the main course and as an believable range of starters love the taste and quality of food the place never disappointed me and team never felt like stopping the best besert l've had worth every bite its a quality service Ambience is also very good l perefar you to reserve in advance since thery have rush throughout the weak .AMBIANCE 4.5/5, FOOD 4.5/5, STAFF 4.5/5"
3.5,"I visited bellandur punjabi times recently though I have been in this area for some time. If you are staying anywhere near 5 KM circumference and craving some nice Punjabi cuisine, this is the closest option one can get.   You can feel punjabi village and ethnic vibes as you enter in decorated door passing through tube-well model, wooden swing, earthen matkas turned into lights and bangles hanged on ceilings. One can also find harbhajan singh and daler mehandi posters embellished on the wall. Overall dcor, music and waiters dresses complement the place.  Coming to food, we ordered chil-mil subzi, cheesy-chilly naan and missi roti. All items were well-cooked, appropriately spiced and similar to home style cooking. Taste wise they are very consistent with one on bannerghatta road. Main course was followed up by Moon Dal halwa and believe me this is one sweet you should definitely try.  I found food slightly expensive and that is something they can look on.   Dcor  3.5 Service - 4 Food - 4  Value for Money - 3  Must Try  Moong Dal Halwa  I recommend."

NO... as I said inspite of 25% extra I pay as all the taxes.. we did not get pleasent service"
4.5,"If you're a foodie Punjabi Times is a place to be. The ambiance, Hospitality, food is simply the best. I have visited this place a number of times, with family and friends. The experience has been really really good. Taste wise i haven't eaten better punjabi food anywhere else. The staff is really well trained and they treat you like the way your family treats you back home. Rate wise its the best bet for the taste and ambiance. Recommend this place for anyone who loves punjabi food."
5.0,"Excellent time  Booked there for my team for around 45 people on Wednesday night they offered us a unlimited package of alcohol and food for 1400 plus tax , earlier we were sceptical about the price but believe me it was worth more that what we actually paid for   Starters  6 staters  which had some great tawa fish and spicy tangy chicken for veggies they had some aloo tikki and some panner tikkas accompanied with some great american bhelpuri and my all time favourite peanut masala   We were actually pampered with good alcohol and the service was quick < non drinkers had their load of mocktails which i heard was good   Now the main course though not many had the courage after starters but we still had a couple of bites  butter chicken , mutton roganjosh and hot naans which was great !!  They could improve on the dal tadka i felt ,  overall vfm place and great service and attentive staff   Will be back soon !!!"
3.0,"Food - 3.5 Ambiance - 3.5  Service - 3 Value for Money - 2.5  Have been here around five times. I live in Bellandur area and this is the only good North Indian Restaurant here. The food is good, the ambiance is okay, the service is decent. However, the reason I would give it a 3, and not a 3.5 is that the place is too expensive for the quality of food and the experience that it gives.   I go there only when I am craving Indian food and do not wish to travel to dine at a better restaurant. This place is convenient as it is right next to office. It generally costs us around Rs. 1500 for two people, depending on how hungry we are. The food is good, but not worth the price.  Would I go there again? Yep, but only when I don't have better alternatives."
3.5,"Punjabi Times opened up a branch in Bellandur a couple years ago. And that brought in some good Punjabi food into the area. I have been there various times for lunches and dinners. Their lunch buffet has a lot of options but quality wise I wasn't impressed. However in a-la carte, the food was pretty good. The paneer tikkas, sheekh kababs, kofta gravy, dal, chicken gravies are nicely made, good in quantity and served well. The service can be slightly slow when it gets crowded, and it DOES get very crowded in the weekends. They sometimes even have musical nights, and the ambience is quite nice in the evenings. The decor complements the place, and has a very ethnic feeling. The dimly lit lights, bangles as lamp reflectors, metal plates and glasses show attention to the decor. Its a good place to go with your family, or friends, or even on a date.   I wish they improve their buffet lunch. Our team mates were quite disappointed in it. For a-la carte, the place is great.                                                                 sheknowsgrub.com"
3.5,"Have been here several times. Satisfactory experience guaranteed!  Starters, main course, drinks and desserts..  Everything will make for a relishing experience. Overall Food tastes good and the term Punjabi is not only for namesake like many other restaurants. Good interior and managed staff.  Definitely worth it!!"
3.5,"Food was tasty. The starters were delicious, except the Soup (Non-Veg), which tasted dull. Main Course and Desserts were also great. And Sweet Lassi was awesome.  Overall Punjabi taste. The service was really great. Awesome experience. But the place was little congested, could be a little more spacious.   We were in for Buffet there. Heard that Buffet and a la carte experience here could be different. Didn't experience the later till."
3.0,"Have mostly ordered home from this resturant. This restaurant gives the flexibility of paying using food coupons, which is a great plus. Food is good, espically the chicken starters. The biriyani is nothing great, the subzi is good but very oily (for the calorie conscious)."
3.5,Overpriced!! Too dark and shady!!food was tasty but then order took a long time .
4.0,"Went for team lunch after a tiring morning! Starting with shorbha - was just fine, not that good. Food was amazing specially the malai chicken and biryani. If you are a desert lover, try gourd halwa there, you'll love! Must visit place with a punjabi touch!"
2.5,"We went for a Office Team Lunch, for the buffet. This is not a place that you enjoy. The Decor is nice. Food is average. The chicken soup tastes like salt water, so salty, that you may want to throw up. The Non veg starters were good, pepper chicken was nice, however the fish smelled bad. The mutton curry smelled like a goat, and the biriyani had no taste. Murgh salgum was watery chicken curry.  All in all, I won't prefer it the next time."
3.5,"We keep frequenting the Punjabi Times, Bannerghatta Road outlet and have found the food satisfactory. This weekend, we were in Bellandur shopping at Evok near the Salarpuria Tech Park. It got quite late for lunch after the lengthy shopping spree, we were famished and wanted the easiest option to dine at. Punjabi Times which was two floors above Evok became the obvious choice.  This outlet is much bigger and hence more scope for making it appear rustic and earthy. Very simple knick-knacks have been used to decorate the place. The walls are adorned with posters of Punjabi celebrities and some illustrations on how the pagdi/Sikh turban has evolved over the years. My eyes caught the ceiling decoration made of plain glass bangles which is quite interesting. Peppy Punjabi numbers were playing in the background. Coming back to the food, we ordered the Khumb Dilwale coz I wanted hubby to try this one. Good dish - I have already spoken about it in my review for the Bannerghatta outlet. I swear by the parathas of this place and make sure the main course includes them. We ordered the onion, gobhi paratha, missi roti and the sukka makhana te panner for the gravy. The paneer dish was yummy, except for a few makhana(lotus seeds) which were hard and we had to set them aside.   The service is decent, but indifferent at times. For instance, the guy who was serving the starter was quite clumsy spilling the salad all over the table. And when the gravy was being served, he forgot to get his napkin to shield himself from the heat of the serving dish. After serving the gravy, he almost banged the dish on the table coz he couldnt withstand the heat!! :D  The bill was around 780 INR which is fine.  A highly recommended place!"
2.5,"Yesterday we team of 12 went to Punjabi TImes for dinner to give a farewell to one of our friend. It happened to be very bad experience. Will never ever go here again. Mainly because of service, its atrocious and highly mismanaged. Had to wait for ages to place the order and to get the food served. Some of the starters we ordered are served just before main course. Starters we tried (tried Malai chicken, Railway chicken and Sheek kabab) are just ok  and main courses (punjabi Chicken + lahore chicken) were below average and not at all worth the money you spend. Rice (Ghee Rice and Curd Rice) we ordered were under cooked, could feel raw rice in every bite. Ok, enough about the bad side, here are something I liked : Lassi was very good (many of us ordered 2). Ambiance is also very nice and there was a live music going on when we went there. My Verdict : Food -             2/5 Service -       .5/5 Ambience-    4/5"
3.5,"Punjabi times is a decent option for Punjabi food and the main attraction for me is actually the vinegar dipped round onions that you get there! :)  I have been to the Bannerghata road one and the Bellandur one and found that the food is almost consistent although Bannerghata Rd would score a tad higher maybe ! The punjabi sizzlers was somethinew new and not too bad but I would recommend strict North Indian foodies to stay away from this one if you are not too adventurous for nothing beats the traditional Butter Naan and Chicken Tikka masala ! :) They have some ridiculous people playing Ghazals at their restaurant and that din is unbearable. I literally wanted to ask them to shut up ! The sideshow apart , the food is quite attractive although the ala carte can get quite expensive!   I would recco this restaurant majorly if you want authentic desi food and a decent ambience!  Although if you're Church Street side then do try Angeethi !!"
3.0,"Have been to team lunch last month, it was a good experience, though I would not consider it to be great as we choose buffet as the source, but the real issue was with the sitting as the rush was too much as it is surrounded by IT hub and ovio it is supposed to be of full rush on a approaching weekend s. Btw coz of such rush we adjusted ourselves in the bar where the waiter initiated to serve us the starters.  Trust me the soup they served was horrible apart from that the other stuffs were good.. But to point it again the fish served to us was pathetic. To conclude the buffet was not upto the mark paying 500 bucks for it."
2.5,Had Ghar-ki-biriyani (both chicken & mutton) - not worth the price !
1.0,"After about a month had a chance to visit a new place: PUNJABI TIMES..   Food: Below Average. The quantity is good but quality is not good . Soup we ordered is cool and requesting bought it again but still it's not tasty. Same is the case gobi started ( lot of salt ).. But paneer curry is good..   Ambiance: Cricketer posters in a formal interiors seemed a bit weird combination. It surely did not look like a sports bar. They could have tried a theme had they wanted the posters around. Not sure if it happens every night but that night they had someone singing gazals. That was good.  Price: Better options avialable near by in central / sarjapur road . Best avoid it..   Service: OK..  Final Verdict - Not good in terms of taste , hope they will improve"
3.5,"Visited Punjabi Times for Team Lunch and overall experience was good. We went for Buffet Lunch and somehow missed booking the table. As its located around number of IT tech parks, you can expect huge rush on weekdays, specially Friday. The manager told us that we have to wait for 20mins, which I assumed that 20mins will stretch to 30mins so we settled for the Bar & Lounge area, which doesn't server buffet but the Waiter was courteous enough to serve us with all the items whenever we asked for. Coming to the food: Soup was pathetic, Veg & Non Veg starters were good except for the fish, which was again pathetic. Mains course was very ordinary. Dessert were good and also they offered good choices. Overall experience: Was satisfactory"
4.0,"I would like to categorize my Review here: Ambiance: Its small yet spacious with more of Desi Feel to it. Window view is the best place to enjoy your lunch/dinner. One Pain I must say is the placement of the rest rooms (narrow entrance). Apart from that nothing to complain about. Feels good. I give it a 3.5.  Food: For a Buffet, they do have a good variety. Served with chilled beer/mocktails/cocktails. The starter are good and so as the main course. If you expect anything else apart from shudh desi Punjabi khana or North Indian khana, you might end up in disappointment. I didnt, so i was Happy. I give it a 3.5.  Service and staff: A real Plus point here i believe. A good hospitality can impress anyone. The behaviour and effort to make you feel satisfied made me give a Full 5.  Pricing: Very reasonable when compared to others in the area. 500 bucs for a buffet including complimentary drinks. I give it a 4.  Verdict: If you are looking for a Desi Food Hangout. This is the place to be. Not to mention opposite to it you find Glassy Lounge. Have fun."
5.0,"I went for dinner day before yesterday, and I was just stunned by the food Quality there. Loved all the cuisine which i ordered. And service was awesome, Inspite of so, much crowd, we got our order within 10 minutes. I must say, This is the place to go again and again."
1.5,the word is DISSAPOINTED. got some good review from my vegie friend. being a  hardcore non-vegie highly dissapointed. asked for galoti kabab and these guy serve sheek kabab in the name of galoti. even motton rogan josh was average. so I didnt get satisfaction for the price I paid.
1.0,"Been there couple of weeks ago on a Thursday eve.... food was served pretty quick within 5-7 min.... quite bland though.   The highlight was Masala Kulcha, which i puked out with first bite... it was rotten; being refrigerated for more than a week. The best part is the attitude of the manager who REFUSES to apologize. Rather boasts that my restaurant is packed with people on weekends. He says, "" I DO NOT CARE even if you write a bad comment anywhere or tell hundreds about my food. You have to pay for the whole food ordered"".  I hail from Amritsar ... one of the BEST places in India to devour North Indian Food and this restaurant adds the adjective of Amritsar in front of every dish.... as in Amritsari Kulcha, Amritsari Fish :-)  For sure, In Bangalore, i would have been happy with fresh and decently cooked food....be it any  cuisine. But, when you shout aloud about Amritsari machchi, Mr. Manager..... please learn some hospitality & courtesy from the city Amritsar, to the minimum !! In case you did not know, the hospitality matters SIGNIFICANTLY in your industry & can get you Brownie points, sometimes more than your average bland food.  WISH the proud owner of 3 outlets of Punjabi Times in Bangalore reads to this and responds !!"
2.0,"Disappointing . Limited choice, lame decor, bad food!"
5.0,"The best Punjabi food with excellent service and extravagant ambiance. tasty food.Well forced to write again,cos this place needs appreciation for the class of food they serve.Alright coming to the ambiance i would definitely rate them 5of5 ,right elements placed just perfect. Food would give them 5of5 ,the best food around in b town.must try would be bhatti da murg-partially chared kebab rightly spiced and well marinated dal maknani is a must try.not to forget the cheesy chilli naan along with the multi grain roti just perfectly set my girlfriend appetite right.The deserts which was just above normal human standards was the paan surprise and the gajar ka halwa. SERVICE-4.5of 5..very happy OVERALL Punjabi times u r doing a fabulous job ."
5.0,Really hungry and went during lunch hours with great expectations. Great food and service. Ambience was a bit odd but good only.
3.5,Nice place. Liked paneer starters. And liked lassi.   Biriyani was bland however.  Don't take the biriyani.
2.0,"I had been to this place about a year ago and had absolutely loved their a-la-carte fare.So today when my team in office decided to go for lunch here, I was excited because I wanted to try their buffet. But I was highly disappointed, let me elucidate why. We were a group of 28 people and the entire lunch was complete chaos. FOOD- For welcome drinks , they had - cocktail/mocktai/beer and there was not a selection of cocktail or mocktail, it was just one in each type. I took the mocktail(strawberry crush something) , was passable. They had 3 veg starters, 3 non veg starters and a soup and a papdi chat.The non veg soup was simply hot water with just one chicken piece in it. Others were lucky enough to get a soup with few more chicken pieces but unfortunately they had missed serving our table of 4 people and when we reminded them , they served us lot later the hot water disguised as soup!! All the starters were pretty average or below average and nothing actually stood out because of it's taste. In the main course they had 3 veg and 3 non veg gravies along with the usual selection of roti, naan, plain rice, chicken biriyani and a peas pulao. Again none of these were really remarkable. Though all the mutton eating people in my team did mention that the mutton roganjosh was quite good, which is quite a compliment because getting mutton dishes right is very difficult For desserts they had ice cream, pastry,tomato halwa and gulab jamun. The gulab jamum was very well done. I think they were trying to be innovative by trying a tomato halwa but some things are better if not experimented with. SERVICE- It was messy from the very beginning. We were seated in tables of 4's and 6's in the central dining area . Some tables were getting served some dishes and others were not. And we had to keep track of who is getting what and ask for it. I actually went and asked them if they could tell us what is there in the starters menu so that we know what to expect but they dint provide us with that information!! In most good restaurants, I have seen when the waiters serve they tell us the dish name and then serve us but here they were just piling food on our plates without a preamble Also I had to ask for water to be served on our table for about 3-4 times. Pathetic service to say the least.  AMBIENCE- The only good thing about the place. Very nicely done up decor . Specially loved the bangles decorated everywhere and the all punjabi feel to it dhols and matkas around.  The buffet cost us about Rs.516 per head including taxes. It was definitely not worth the money!!!   My Ratings- Food - 2.5/5 Service - 2/5 Ambience- 3/5                                             gourmandsdesire.com"
2.5,"We were a group of 4 and went to this place as the nearby restaurant 'Grills and Gravy' was closed. I liked the ambiance and the staff was very friendly. We ordered two chicken starters and they were amazing. We instantly had high hopes for our main course. But we were very disappointed by the outcome.   We had ordered a 'chicken lababdar' which was so salty that we ate it only because all of us had already taken few bites and we didn't feel like returning the half eaten dish. Disappointed by trying a new dish we decided to go for something which every restaurant gets right..""chicken butter masala"". But somehow, they spoiled this dish too. It was so sweet that we could even manage a single bite.   The chef heard us and immediately replaced the dish with another chicken item, but our appetite was already spoiled by this time. The bill was a pretty hefty too. We decided we won't be coming back to this place any soon.  I must still convey that the starters, jeera rice and the lassi were good. It was only the main course which spoiled our dinner."
3.5,"After about a month had a chance to visit a new place: PUNJABI TIMES.... Its very much approcable, just a 100-150 mtr walk from Bellandur Central towards Sarjapur Junction on the right. Placed on the 2nd floor of the building, parking on the basement. Ambience: i quiet liked the place, as it has used very common things and represented it very nicely. Different coloured bangles in a formation was attracting me. Paper cutting walls having punjabi stars like Bhajji/Daler/Dharmendr and sons was good. Service: Service was very good. We were promptly shown our place where we had a view of the ring road. The tables are spaciously placed giving some privacy. Food: Food was descent enough for the price. we ordered Tomato shorba nd chicken shorba.Both were just OK, nothing amazing. Skip that even if u want to. for starters we had an railway murg and aloo makkai sev di tikki. Railway murg was too good, yes but the veg starter was a bit disappointing for me.in Mains we ordered chilly cheese naan,aloo paratha and mixed veg paratha, all were good but chilli cheese naan was outstanding. WIth that we ordered murg tikka labbabdar and keema subz. Both complemented the breads. And we 4 were stuffed to our limits. Didnt have stomach for an dessert, hence skipped. Wallet Factor: The total bill including tax's came to around  1700 bucks for 4 which was pretty descent."
1.0,"Simply can't express my disgust in words. Food is very bad. Paneer malai kofta was like stone kofta - very hard. Chicken was half-cooked. After telling that, the boy just took it again to kitchen, cooked once more. But it was still hard.  Very much overpriced. Our actual bill amount was 980/- but they charged 10% service charge (though service was not goo), s.tax & VAT and then the overall biil came to 1270/- almost 30% more.  Will never visit this again and never recommend any one."
4.5,"This place has good food, nice desserts,good service and nice live music...recommended for a good time...had a lot of fun.. And you can request your choice of music as well."
3.0,"went here yesterday (14 July). was recommended by a friend.   Starters: Good spread and delicious. Ordered Paneer based and chicken based. Decent quantity.  Main Course - We were not lucky enough to be served with what we expected. Our chicken dish had only gravy filled upto the brim with around couple of 1/2 inches chicken pieces. It tasted awful and we eventually ended up eating the roti with gravy. There was no onions (as per the manager - the stock was over at 9 pm. what a dumb).   Dessert - good and yummy. Lassi is amazing.  Drinks - bit expensive. so one shouldn't order anything more than a pint probably; just for the mood.   Service - The Captains (as they are called), are nice and hospitable. Although the Manager is a bit arrogant and gives idiotic explanations. But i give him a rat's a**.   Overall - Food for 2 - Rs 1400 with drinks.  My partner being a vege enjoyed. i was sulking bcos my non-veg got screwed up. But the place is good so i will give them another shot."
2.5,alcohol terribly expensive food is too spicy ambience is just average
3.0,"As we were in Bellandur, decided which place to eat, Punjabi Times came to our mind as you can see its board flashing ""I Times"" from very far. (PUNJAB lights from the banner seem to be down) and that kinda made us a bit curious about the maintenance of the restaurant from inside.   Food: Average. The quantity is excellent. Also the taste of paneer curries, dal makhani,was good. However i was not impressed with Naan and Kulcha they just seemed to be of different shape nothing more. Also the Nan was not properly cooked and was raw in some parts.  Ambiance: Cricketer posters in a formal interiors seemed a bit weird combination. It surely did not look like a sports bar. They could have tried a theme had they wanted the posters around. Not sure if it happens every night but that night they had someone singing gazals. That was good.  Price: Decently priced for quanity.  Service: The staff seemed to ignore us until our order was ready as if they were trying to avoid being asked how long it will take. We had to call them 2 or more times to make them come and take any additional order of beverages or starters that we wanted to give. ________________________________  Final Verdict - Nothing special about the place. There are better options around."
3.5,"I visited to punjabi times for a get together with old friends on a saturday eve. The interior was on average. But i liked the live music. The crew was really helpful on suggesting the menus and dishes. Tried railway kabab, arsenal kabab, reshmi kabab in starter. All were really nice n tasty specially railway kabab a must try.. ordered couple of cocktails n cocktails..those were just average ..so the main courses and the prices were upto the Mark.. Overall a good place to try out. Definitely will revisit. :-)"
3.5,"Visted the place as I happen to be in this part of the town n on a friend's recomendation.To start with a pretty above  average ambiance n attentive staff who could be a lil faster on the service front.N now the crux of the review the food. All non-veggies so to start with we ordered 3 non-veg  starters, the Alishan kebab ...which was suculent well marinated pieces of kebab topped with cheese...with a killer combo like this how can one go wrong.Next was amritsari fish...a tad disappointing...as the flavours were not too pronounced n it could have been cooked better.N the final starter was the railway Murg....a really interesting dish which had a taste which was unique n really delivered. For the mains it was a dal makhani ....the usual taste which had a very typical desi flavor. N a murgh tikka lababdar...juicy tikkas in a tasty gravy. All this was had with the usual suspects ... soft tandoori roti n avg jeera rice.N of course all through out the meal we were well lubricated with pegs of old monk for the hard core drinkers n Shikanji for the non-hardcore drinkers.Must say in terms of quantity ... they rate avg ... not generous but not stingy either. N in terms cost...not too bad...just the food it was around 2.1k...so for 3 non-veg starter, a dal n 1 main non-veg dish n the accompainements of rice n roti...not a bad deal.Would like to visit this place if I happen to be in this part of town again n am craving north Indian food as this place is pretty authentic when it comes to the taste."
1.5,"I won't say that the food was bad but very average and certainly doesn't justify the price. Ambience is good but the service isn't, atleast on weekend evenings when i had been there. Never earlier in my life I was served such a ""kabab"" - chicken first boiled and then grilled. And I hope never again. Pathetic."
1.0,"They have Buffet on table concept which is bad due to slow service. Almost all things reached us cold. Taste was not so good. All in all, we didn't like the place at all and won't ever think of  visiting again."
3.0,Good place .. Excellent tasty food .. But the service is so unprofessional for that kind of place n price   Believe me the guy who served us never smiled and he even managed to spill water on us
4.0,Beautiful ambiance and good food. :)  their rotis are a lil small but taste is really good.  perfect for small celebrations.
2.5,Came here on a week day for lunch.  I was quite impressed by the reviews but the place did not meet my expectations. . The food was very average. .nothing new.  Shorba was luke warm. .chicken in starter n main course was quite hard. However I loved the decoration by bangles. .n the lassi was just amazing.  Overall not very satisfied.
4.5,i went to the restaurant after reading the rave reviews. n to my delight they were all true. the decoration is simply awesome. for few minutes i was choosing where to sit because every nook n corner was beautiful. after sitting the waiters dressed in traditional clothes came to greet us. the owner or manager came to us for suggesting dishes. n let me tell u they know what they serve. this is rare!! we ordered a platter n sizzler. which was delicious. they took very less time to serve us order!!  we also ordered lassi which was just out of the world!! meanwhile i just kept clicking pictures of the deco. this place is my choice whenever  crave for punjabi food!! n of course the courteous staff!!
3.0,Just visited this place .ambience is fine . Starter is good however the curries we ordered was fair not met the expectations. The desert  double ka meeta was not met our expectations too Suitable for Just a office catchup dining ..choose your menu with care :)
4.5,"Seldom do I write a review about a place twice, especially after having a good experience the first time round as this leaves little scope of betterment for the second time. After last night's hugely appetizing dinner, I am compelled to break tradition and put in words, what can be described as a soul-satisfying dinner !  In the vicinity of Bellandur with my girlfriend insisting on proper desi khana, decided to stroll into Punjabi times as I knew we couldn't go wrong with this place. I was highly insistent though that I would try something new and not regular on the menu, to see the chef's skill and also cos I was in a mood to experiment. After rustling through the menu for a good ten minutes, I came across an interesting choice (Amritsari Chole Sizzler). Upon enquiring with the waiter, he explained that it was a combination of chole, parathe, rice and alu makai tikki served as a sizzler. Intrigued as much, I ordered for the same and girlfriend decided on the evergreen favorite : rajma chawal. We also ordered for alu parathas. In a few minutes, the owner walked out and spoke to us for a good few minutes explaining about the dishes, variety and was very friendly. Within no time, my sizzler arrived and it looked like a feast to the eyes! In 15 minutes, the whole of it was devoured, the amritsari chole were typically masalewale... with rice losing out on a bit of sheen due to being sizzled but good nonetheless, and amazing parathe! In the meantime, the rajma chawal and aloo parathe also arrived. Need to mention that the rajma was perfectly cooked, and went down as a delight with the aloo parathe. Satisfied and perched on cloud 9 at this point, I was bought back to ground when the waiter came and asked us for desserts. Too full for the same, I politely declined. At this point, the owner (Mr.Angad Singh) came back and offered a couple of choices, which were intriguing again!!! He suggested that we try the paan flavored ice cream, which we did order, and am glad we did! Definitely try this one out, the ice cream is so well flavored with the essence of a sweet paan, u will be left wondering why other restaurants don't do it ! Full marks for the innovation, and another satisfying experience at Punjabi Times. Bon appetit People!   ----- 07 Mar, 2013 -----  Punjabi times, as the name says it, concentrates on offering an authentic Punjabi dining experience. It lives up to its name with some authentic punjabi food on the menu ( railway murg, dal makhni, murg tikka lababdaar, amritsari macchi , alu sev tikki, rogan josh ) being my personal favorites. Food service is quite efficient and quick, and they have valet parking. Dessert menu is sumptuous and nothing better to top it off with a huge glass of lassi. They have some singers performing during the weekends which offers an alternative to regular boring classical music playing out of speakers.The ambience is quite nice and upon enquiring, found out it was hand-done by the owners themselves.. price is okay for quantity.. definitely recommend it for punjabi food !"
4.0,"I had been to this place in the bannerghatta outlet , and knew about the food of course , So one day while searching for dinner place on outer ring road, we saw this one and i immediately asked to stop the car to check out the outlet here . This i snot hard to find place, You can see it from the main road.   Ambiance : I like the ambinace here .  Its huge , A lot of seating space and private too.we were six and we took a big table on a side and it was good. The ambiance is private , Comfortable and the staff is courteous , so its all good.   Food :  the food here is good, definately above teh normal standards. I like the tandoori gobhi and i orderd alu parantha this time and i was not disappointed. Usuallu wherever i order alu parantha i get disappointed because its not up to the mark  but here its good.   The Non veg here is also good . Husband tried teh seekh kababs with rotis and it was juicy and soft. perfectly cooked. the other non vegeterian dishes also ( i dont remeber the name now )  are also delicious.   In dessert we ordered ras malai and Shahi tukda. I loved the shahi tukda here . The lassis here are not too sweet which works for my palate.   Over all , Its a good place to go and you get really good food which is perfect for the price you pay . Must try if you are in the area."
1.0,"Currently siiting at punjabi times at bellandur. This place is big no no. The staff here are extremly ill mannered.Service is slow.I have ordered for Sindh da meat and they had given me most of the pieces which is not worth eating and when I complaint about that the so called  waiter whose name is Santu das, started arguement.I will never visit this place."
4.5,Awesome food with a proper punjabi ambience...i simply love this place...a bit costly but its worth it!
2.0,"This place looked big and nice from the ambiance when we entered, and we were give a table without cushions on the back. But when we asked for a table change to a cushions on the back one, they refused saying all of them are reserved, and nobody came on those tables till we left ! We ordered a veg platter, and none of the 5 items from that platter was worth having.. They tasted like they were prepared a day before. None of the main course dishes were good. Service was also slow and poor. And bill was almost 500 per head!!! Very disappointing!"
4.0,"What a fun, bright place this was.   I loved the way the pillars as well as the lighting on the ceiling had been decorated with colored glass bangles giving it that festive, Baisakhi all year round look. Oh did I mention the earthen 'matkis', Symbol of the Khanda ( SIkhism's religious symbol), Punjabi alphabets, dholkis, and my favoritest the map of Punjab made out of bronze/brass/copper katoris on one side.   What a visual treat!!   The food, was well af-course everything Punjabi and 'North Indian' and about as close as you can get to it also. Thank god for that. Finally a place which served true North Indian fare without pretending it was so.   The Jullundri Jal Jeera and Aam Panna were bang-on.   The Veg Seekh Kababs were average but the Paneer Cheese Tikka made up for it.   The rich Murg Malai kebabs were succulent and came in a hearty portion with a generous flavoring of garlic.   With any Punjabi eatery the first thing I always try in their main course is the Dal Makhani, frankly the make or break of a place for me. This one surely made me happy enough to want to go their once again. It was some of the best I have had in Bangalore so far.   Overall a Happy place with all things Punjabi. Burraahhhh!!!"
4.0,Good Punjabi food which is fairly priced... A must go for any food lover.
3.0,"It is situated at Bellandur ,almost on outer ring road . The ambience reminds you of ""Sada Punjab"". The Food preparation is mostly authentic. The non vegetarian preparations are must try ..be it kebabs or the main course. Even the vegetarians would love this place. Little expensive by its standards though. But must visit place for Punjabi food lovers. I am sure their heart will go ""Balle Balle"" after visit this place.                                                                 thefoodietales.com"
3.5,"I have been to Punjabi times twice. Once with colleagues for a team lunch and other time with friends for dinner. Both the times it was an OK experience. The restaurant has pictures of a number of Punjabi mundas and mundis all over the walls. They also have pretty cool bangle decorations which is nice. They always have a band (3-4 people) singing classical hindi songs during dinner time.  The food here is pretty good, but its a little pricey. The alcohol is priced pretty well and goes well with the punjabi food. The lunch with colleagues was a set menu and it was priced at 350+ taxes which was pretty decent. They even served the food and we didnt have to go to the buffet to get it.  A decent restaurant will good food but a little pricey. Might go back here again if run out of options."
1.0,Very Costly...Just plain curd cost around INR 60 :(
1.0,"The food was really bad! Its not worth for the money.. The chicken was not fresh.. It was smelling like atleast a week old meat!.. I dont suggest this to anyone and I dont enter the Punjabi Times at anytime in my life!.. If they offer the free food also, i wont recommond it.."
3.0,"All awesome Punjabi food in Bangalore but it's pinching on the pocket. Can hang-out at any other good place for this price. Really liked the water wheel at the entrance. That was a charm. The service was ok, could be faster but yes courteous. The overall ambiance can be rated to 3/5. Missed the real Punjabi feel somehow. Lassi was pretty authentic. Overall can go once for nice food."
4.5,The Aloo makai sev di tikki and Bhindi kurkure is a good way to start for vegetarians. Bhatti da Murgh is tender and served as a substantial portion.  The staff is very good and frindely
1.5,Confused service... Forgot to give half the order...
4.5,"we always love & prefer coming here  today paneer was nice and still good food  staff very friendly caption das very decent boy he suggest food   ----- 26 Dec, 2012 -----  food was  good and staff was  very friendly the raliway murg and aloo sev tikki was  good  the ambience looking  was very nice it looks like as mini punjab   ----- 26 Dec, 2012 -----  the food and staff were very good  we were enjoy the food,   railway murg & was very good and must try aloo seve tikki and lahori murg was execeleant and staff was very good frindly"
2.5,"Food quality degraded here after they started serving Alcohol, don't know if the cooks is changed here as initially when this place started here in bellandur i visited a couple of times did not disappointing but recently food quality is degraded."
3.0,"We went to this place expecting to have a sumptuous and filling Punjabi buffet  It's been a while since we went out to eat and a birthday seemed the right excuse to get that done. We zeroed in Punjabi Times, since it was very close to our home and we had pretty much covered everything else in the area.  The ambiance is decent and very ethnic. The staff was courteous and helpful. As usual, we were hoping to have a sumptuous buffet but unfortunately the Buffet is available only for a group of 10 or more. According to the waiter, thats because it will be difficult to serve buffet for a small group - an excuse we found utterly rubbish.   Anyways, so we ordered from the menu. The jaljeera, chatpate paneer tikka and Railway Murg were all decent enough. However the Railway Murg can be rated better than the Chatpatte Paneer Tikka for taste and serving portions. For the main course we ordered Amritsari Subzi which was a total letdown for me and the Murg Tikka Lababdar which was passable.  The Cheesy Chilli Naan is different and deserves a try. Surprisingly all of us were full and did not opt for either any Rice items or desserts for that matter. The bill of 1090 for the food  (for 3 people) seemed reasonable. But the grand total came up to Rs.1411 including VAT, ST and Service Charge of 10%.  It's not really the kind of place I would go for a second time."
1.5,"I have ordered around 4-5 times from this restaurant and I am writing this review due to the horrendous experience I had last time. I'll be fair in my review to say that their food is usually okay, average stuff that is priced a little on the higher side. Not VFM, if you ask me because you can get the same food elsewhere at a lesser price. But still, their Chicken Biryani, Dal Makhni & Chicken Tikka Masala are usually good.   Anyway, I had ordered from PT on Wednesday night i.e. 12th December. We ordered for Amritsari Jhinga i.e. Prawns, Kakori Kebab, Dal Makhni, Murg Tikka Lababdar, Lachcha Paranthas & Butter Naan. Cost me around 1500 INR and caused a lot of heartburn.   Easily the WORST food I have ever had in a long long time. The Prawns were extremely salty & in a portion that cost me some 300 bucks, there were only 4 tiny prawns!!! The rest being a concoction of yellow, green capsicum & onions and LOTS and LOTS of salt. The Kakori Kebabs were hard & cold and nobody touched them after tasting them once. The Murg Tikka Lababdar was tasteless, left much to be desired. They even got the Lachcha paranthas wrong as even they were salty & hardly chewable. Dal Makhni was eatable & so were the naans.  The rest of the food went where it was destined to go - the DUSTBIN.  I did give the call center a call & spoke to the Manager & gave him my feedback.   A definite NO NO if you're planning to order a home delivery from this joint, or at least taste the food before you pay their delivery boy. Going by the other reviews, they do take better care of diners."
2.5,"We went to this place twice, once on a weekday and once over the weekend. Must be noted that the food and service on weekdays is better due to less crowd.  We tried the following over the two visits - jullundri jal jeera, chaanch, aloo makkai shorba, khumb dilwale. The drinks are nothing special, the soup was innovative, but not bad. The starter was decent. We ordered phulkas and a veg gravy which was quite ordinary. Eatable, but not remarkable.  We also ordered two of their vegetarian sizzlers  during our second visit (I somehow do not see them in the menu now), both of which were extremely disappointing. Ironically the only thing that sizzled was the lettuce leaf. The food was not even lukewarm. The aloo tikki which was part of the sizzler combo was positively cold (taken right out of the refrigerator). We tried badami rabdi with litchee for dessert once and it was very good. Since I am a vegetarian I cannot comment on the non-veg dishes they serve.  The ambience is good, with tasteful decorations. But they should do away with placing water jugs and food on a stand in the corner, which kills the effort put in decorating the place. The seats near the window overlooking the ORR offer a night view of the ring road lit up with vehicle headlights.  Service is very poor. They did not even apologise for the cold sizzlers and we had to call the waiter multiple times to even fill a glass of water.  Overall, the taste of food is ok, but not a place worth going to if you are planning for a special dining experience. Fits fine for a random unplanned dinner if you happen to be around that area. It is neither authentic nor great-tasting. Desserts are quite good. The ambience is decent. And I really hope they improve their service quality, specially considering the service charge they add to the bill."
1.0,This is useless and shabby place to be. Te food served is stale food hence forget about the taste. The payasam is served from the tumbler kept at the entrance which is not clean & refill on daily basis.................horrible :( .........This is the crap place to hang around.
2.0,"15 of us decided to go to punjabi times for a team lunch form office. We went for the pre-fixed buffet. This costed around 500 per head. Now, the buffet is serve on your table. Which is good and bad. The menu was terribly bad for the vegetarians. With tandoori vegetables and fruits which tasted like sugar candies it was a bad start. Then came the onion pakodas. And after that came nothing for the vegetarians. I think that was cheating. 500 is very high for such starters. Now came the main course. The 2 Curries served were 1) Aaloo Muuter 2) Palak Paneer. The panner was actually not all that great. You may feel this also not worth your money. Roti was served I cant remember if it was with butter or not. Then came the veg biriyani. The kind of biriyani you get in any of the shanti sagars in the city for 50 Rs a plate. And this one tasted bad compared to the Shanti sagar biriyani. Dessert was gulab jamun with ice cream. AND nothing else.   Come to think of other buffets which charge you 500 in the city. Like say chutney chang etc.  You will surely feel cheated with the Buffet here. I really dont have the guts to there for the ala - carte  The extra star is for the decor and the ok ok staff. Else it would have been a 1 star."
1.0,"Writing the post on the fly... heard lot about panjabi time, got good review plan for lunch and in result Pathetic Experience in Taste . They should not call it panjabi. The ambiance is very dark even if it is a lunch time. Anyway no much complains about it still it looks good. But a foody goes for good food. Recommend not to come if u expect good taste.  Rest all your choice. My one star just for the shake of."
4.0,"Being a true blue non-vegetarian, I rarely order veg starters. Due to circumstances, I did and was pleasantly surprised to find that the veg starter tasted much better than the non-veg one. Punjabi times lives upto its name by serving proper Punjabi khaana . But there are some other not so Punjabi dishes on the menu which are also worth trying.  The staff was also very courteous and made efforts to serve us within the short break my friends and me had managed steal from the working hours."
2.0,"We planned for a Pre Diwali Dinner but didn't wanna go anywhere far, so we decided to Check out Punjabi Times. The first impression was Very Good, as we got out of the lift we were greeted with a energetic Sat-shri-akaal.. The staff was very good(which is a rare sight in this area) especially our waiter,awesome energy purely punjabi feel.. BUT and thats a big one...The food was terrible..At one point of time we thought that the restaurant has ran out of spices and salt.. Nothing Punjabi about it.."
3.0,"BALLE ! BALLE ! Going in a group for some Punjabi food ! This is it!  Following the Friday  tradition of ensuring that we colleagues go out for  Friday Lunch we landed at Punjab Times ! Located bang on Outer ring  road surrounded by IT offices , it is bound  to be crowded  during Lunch time . Loved the decor - garish , audacious , loud  colors , very different and nice !   We ordered lassi  and aam ka  paana , was dissapointed with the aam ka paana - it was synthetic not the original taste ! Next came amritsari macchi  this was nice . the dal makaani with rotis is a must try . the veg array at this place is good .end your meal with kulfi .... This definitely not fine dining experience but going in a group for some Punjabi food ! This is it !"
3.0,"Tasty north Indian food, good ambiance and good place to go with family. They include 10% service charge in bill itself..so no need of additional tip."
1.0,"Pathetic..that is the only word to describe this restaurant. Nothing feels you special here it food, ambiance , even the service..  So Guys AVOID IT."
1.0,"Useless, and definitely not even near the real Punjabi food prepared in my home town Delhi."
1.0,A ridiculous excuse for a north Indian restaurant! The place scores on the ambiance factor albeit barely but everything else is just plain pathetic!  They have this new concept of running a punjabi themed restaurant with a staff that is anything but from north! We ordered 3 non-veg starters and 4 main course dishes all of which were sweet and kind of bland. Veg food was ok and the service is really slow! The kicker came in the end when we ended up paying 5.5k for 8 people and left with a tummy half empty and bemused as to how did this place make it in the zomato's list of trending restaurants? Surely Bangalore has more to offer than this!Zomato please fix this!
3.0,Tried this place as an alternative to Bakasru after seeing pathetic review about Bakasur here.  A restaurant with nice ambience and theme. Ideal for a family outing. We went on a Saturday lunch outing and found exactly what we were looking for. The crowd was family stuff and a very courteous staff made the luch even more enjoyable.  Overall a nice experience.
4.0,Last night I had gone with friends to punjabi times restaurant for celebrating my birthday.Food was very good specialy shikandari raaaaan.....along with drinks specialy shooters was just 'wow'never tasted before definatly w'll be back thanks guys cheer's........!
3.0,Great food and ambience...We had a team outing and had dinner at Punjabi Times.
5.0,"Punjabi Times is a sit-down dining experience in an ethnic ambience across a two locations in Bangalore. The ambience is aimed at being traditional Indian and greatly complements the food. It's affordable prices make Punjabi times a top choice for the discerning. I had gone there for dinner with family.The food is amazing.I am a regular customer there. The ""Batti do murg"",mushroom dilwale,kakori kababs,chole sizzlers,stuff paranthas and not to forget..dal makhani and Moong dal ka halwa..are to die for!!!These  are some of my favourites. Its a total value for money place to be.:):)"
5.0,Great food and ambience...We had a team outing and had lunch at Punjabi Times...True punjabi flavour especially sarso da saag was treat to us....
2.0,"I must have visited them a couple o times. Nice ambience, okay food, average service. Dont expect the moon here as you will not get it."
3.0,They have a nice ambience... but they need to focus on food which at best is average. Lots of waiting time for orders placed. Lunch they advertise thali but is not available when you ask for it and the place is crowded. They better buck up as Bakasur is coming and Chakra has opened as well.
3.0,"The location at Outer Ring Road works as an advantage for Punjabi Times. It is really convenient for the host of offices near by. We have been there twice for team lunches. The ambiance is very bright and cheerful. The first visit did not leave a favorable impression of the service but the food was good. The second visit was better. The lassi is nice and thick.Also in veg starters aloo makki sev di tikki is different n worth a try. There are a lot of options for the main course as well with a nice spread of roties.Amongst desserts Shahi Tukda is a must try if you are a fan of the crispy, sweet n creamy rich flavor of rabdi and bread. But again they can work upon improving their service."
2.0,Decent but pricey. Waiters are clueless and so is the manager.
5.0,"People who say we do not get good north Indian food in Bangalore....then guys u gotta visit this restaurant ... Amazing ambiance, dedicated service, delicious food..............and refreshing drinks.....its a must place to eat who loves mouth watering food......"
1.0,"Pathetic Service, the worst service I have seen in Bangalore. Food was not too bad, but it never came to the table. Waiters, the Manager are all confused on what is happening in the restaurant."
3.0,"Food  - well done .. except for the sizzler that I order. I must say the rest was very well done but then I tell myself for the price we pay in such restaurant, they better work on the food. Now coming back to something in the menu ""Amritsari chole kulcha sizzler"", everyone is free to experiment but why try it out on your customers when you don't even care to take the feedback. This was a disaster, why would an authentic Punjabi restaurant want to try something in sizzler and fail so badly. I am not sure about the other sizzlers but this one was a disaster.    Well the service, Me: "" can you get me ""sirke wala pyaaz"" ?"" Waiter : [really puzzled ] "" what is that sir""  Waiter : [waits and responds] "" no sir we dont serve that""  five minutes later I see the same thing getting served on another table.   very sluggish when it comes to attending their customers but when it comes to clearing the table, they wont even care to ask your permission.   So I wont be surprised if someone tries to clear your plate even when you are half way through.   Well also when you order your food, you try to order everything in one go  soups , appetizers , main course , deserts.   But then here you should think twice,  everything lands on your table at once. They just don't care about the order, I wouldn't be surprised if they serve your desert at first and rest will be dumped on your table in another 60 seconds. BIG TURN OFF to see all that food lying on your table and then you just feel as if you did the dumbest thing by ordering everything in go.  I have much more to say about their bad service , but let me stop here and suggest ""They need to work on the service"".. its terrible , you will find better service on road side Dhaba's.   Lastly, guys you need to know the air conditioner is not meant freeze people  in your restaurant....   over all I would say   food - 3/5 service 1/5  Its little pricey , but then in today's economy even they need to survive, so if you just are bothered about food and can ignore their bad service, go for it :)   Thumbs up for serving falooda matka kulfi !!!!"
4.0,"One of the best punjabi food is served in Punjabi times, believe me being a north indian, its really difficult to relish punjabi food at places in Bangalore. The ambience, the music, the service, the variety of food(veg & non veg) is great. Been here twice with my same set of friends for dinner. And both times, we had smiles at our faces while leaving the place..."
3.0,typical pujabi ambience 2 gud!.. gr8 fud.. nt a place 4 vegetarians cuz non-veg smell bothers.. no dedicated person 4 a table.. gotta improve...!!!!
