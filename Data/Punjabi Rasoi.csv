4.0,Although Sunday night was quite crowded. It signifies the place is really popular . My experience ratings are as below: Foodtaste-4.5 Ambience-4 Variety-5 Service standards-4 Serving time-4
2.0,"Everything was above average. Ratings could have been 5 star. Only because of Mutton Punjabi and cost factor vis-a-vis value for money, it has gone to 3 Star. Also the cost for two is as per attached bill photo image. Mutton Punjabi looked like broiler chicken and tasted too like broiler chicken, but wasn't accepted by anyone in restaurant (waiter, captain, cook and manager) as a broiler chicken. This was my 6th and most probably the last visit to this place. Rest everything is okiedokie."
2.0,"Nothing so great about the place. Went there for team lunch last week. Not so impressive ambience, neither the food.  Staff was arguing for most of the things. Wait time for food was too much. We ordered Achari Paneer Tikka, Hara Bhara Kebab, mushroom takatak, Paneer lababdar, butter chicken, dal tadka, lassi...apart from panner and chicken rest was below average...kebab tasted like burnt cookies and even looked like one....mushroom took forever to come, looks like they were growing it and tasted only of coriander powder. There are definitely much better places in Indra nagar for Punjabi food. This place doesnt do justice to their name."
5.0,This is an awesome place for a party and get together if you are foody... The foods are very very tasty... No words to say.... Out of my experience..
4.0,"A very good north indian restaurant. The service was quick. The tandoori chicken had pretty small leg pieces which was disappointing.  Main course were great. Piece of advice - dont order two same based gravy, you wont feel the difference in the dishes. Dessert was good. All in all a pocket friendly place."
5.0,"This is one of the best place to enjoy authentic Punjabi food. I have been going there from almost 10 years now, when they had just 1 branch in Indranagar. The owners are very friendly people. The service is awesome. Chicken Chaat is my fav here. Definitely a place worth visiting and highly recommended."
1.0,"I am a fan of Punjabi Rasoi, HSR layout. Had gone Indira nagar one for dinner. Expectation was high as HSR. But the taste of foods were seriously bad. Not recommended this. You will not like if you have ever once gone to HSR punjabi rasoi. The signature recipe like Amritsari chicken is changed completely here. It is dry starter in HSR, very tasty, in indira nagar they will give you as gravy."
1.0,This restaurant USED to be so good.  I recently ordered their Non Veg Thali and a Mutton Seekh Kebab. The Thali was absolutely mediocre. The 'Butter Chicken' tasted like it wasn't cooked enough and it still has the raw masala flavour to it. It was just too oily.  And the Mutton Seekh Kebab had to be the worst Seekh Kebab I've ever had. It tasted like it was frozen and it was just so hard. The quality of the meat was very questionable.  I can't believe that The Punjabi Rasoi has stooped so low in terms of quality. Avoid.
4.0,"Food 5 /5 , if you love spicy and North Indian food this place is perfect for that , always full , table booking is must. Service was good , only thing which can be better is ambience ,it's bit small place and always full because of food"
4.0,"Good place to try some north indian food. All the chicken dishes be it the chicken tikka, chicken chat or the chicken biriyani were delicious. The rotis were nice too. Pocket friendly place."
2.0,"Being a big foodie explorer, I had visited this place with local friend on weekend.I had to wait to grab a place.We ordered Veg -paneer,dal,jeera rice and like soda. Food wasnt cooked well. Taste will not dissappoint you.But you will definetely regret next day when your stomach goes down. I guess ingredients used werent good quality to make it tasty and water used is definetely not RO or filtered one. They dont ask you as well if you need mineral water or normal water. I found this place pricy too . I would not recommend this place."
5.0,"Hands down, the best north Indian restaurant in Bangalore that too with reasonable prices. They definitely need to work on their Dal Makhani but apart from that every dish that I have had here has always lived upto my expectations. Keep at it Punjabi Rasoi! :)"
2.0,"The moment I entered the restaurant I felt like I was in vegetable market, that much noisy it was! The food was below average in taste and the service was super fast as they already knew what we were gonna order! One can surely visit if everything else is closed.."
4.0,Simple ambience with yummy food and very reasonable price. Staff is also very polite and service pretty quick too. Have visited this place many a times and it had lived upto my expectations almost (not all ) everytime
5.0,"Food is awesome ,Biryani need to improvise ,kabab and food is good we visited indranagar restaurant last week we enjoyed with kabab  n kulcha"
4.0,"You can find proper punjabi food here. Afgani chicken and dal makhani are my all time favourite here. When it comes to service, I would give 3/5 but apart from this I like everything from food to ambience. Overall - 4/5"
5.0,"Wah wah wah!!! I guess saying any other thing is just waste of time. Food & Taste : Awesome Value for Money : definitely yes Ambience : very good Service : Friendly  I would recommend people to this place. Thanks team Punjabi Rasoi, you all deserve."
4.0,"Received our parcel few mins back, we have ordered kheer for meeting our dessert craving .Thanks for sending Onion salad and dosa chutney with the same . I feel you guys should be awarded with Oscar award for providing us Onion and Chutney with kheer. Lol   Can't come over this"
5.0,"I had heard a lot about Punjabi Rasoi and I actually tried the restaurant only very recently and I was taken aback at how much I would love the food! Tried the butter chicken, aloo gobi and mutton takatak and I loved all of them! The lassi and naans were great as well! Would recommend to anyone who wants to eat great punjabi food!"
2.0,Initially the taste of the food was good... I feel the quality of food has degraded.. you can easily make out if you had been to this place earlier...I think they have forgot to review their quality.
1.0,"I am a regular visitor to this restaurant from past 5 years in Indiranagar branch, though sometimes I had visited HSR too, earlier also i faced some issues for the hospitality which they provided, but food was good so I ignored, the experience which I had yesterday night, is really disgusting , and cheap on the management part of the restaurant, so what happened, I got my gravy packed as I could not finish it, and later when I came home, and felt like having my gravy at home, toy surprise , it was not even 1/4 of the quantity which I asked them to pack... I don't understand how can they keep the part of my food and just give me a tiny quantity...And the best part was, when I complained against this, the so called mangement person, called me and he infact blamed me , that I am mistaken instead of accepting their mistake and apologies.. Gosh ... These people really like to serve their staff the left over food of their customers... really pathetic and not acceptable...Its my harden money which I spend every weekend almost on their restaurant... They don't even apologies on their mistake and asked me to check camera.... M imagining , can they really show me footage of food taken from my table till the place where it was packed.... camera only records at one direction.. I can only say, they have the worst hospitality even if their food is better... I don't know about others, but I like to go to such restaurants where I can get better hospitality and food at the same time...I hope u all beware abt the stuff which you are getting pack and thinking to eat later ..."
1.0,Ordered food from here yesterday. Veg kadhai was stale and was tasting bad and they had put a lot of oil in the vegetable as well as dal. Disappointed
4.0,"|| Punjabi Food || || Sunday Dinner ||  I was having a craving for Kulchas so went there last sunday for dinner.  Ambience: The ambience is simple and as the seating arrangement is of wooden table and chairs and steel plates and glass is used.  Staff/Service: No complain on this part. The staff and service both are quick.  Food: In starters we ordered Chicken Tilka which was so so so yummy I cannot express. Best Chicken Tikka I have ever had. After that in main course we ordered Chicken Lababdar( Boneless ) , 1 Butter Naan and 2 Amritsari Kulcha. Chicken was nice and tender. Kulchas were yum yum totally. And at last we take garam garam Gulab Jamuns. Jamuns were also great in taste.  Overall I can say it was nice way to end the weekend with these delicious food.  #Phone_Camera_Food_Life"
2.0,The food was decent but not up to the standards of punjabi rasoi and the service was very bad. Order was delayed and wrong order was served. On the whole a total disappointment. I have been to other rasoi outlets but this was a let down.
1.0,"The food quality has gone down over the years. Usually the vegetables used are not fresh. Even parts that are rotten, like aloo that has turned black or has holes will be included in the gravy. in dishes like aloo capsicum, you can hardly find even 3 pieces of capsicum. Mostly it would be rotten potatoes dipped in tons of oily standard punjabi gravy to increase the quantity; that is a complete opposite of how an actual dry aloo capsicum sabzi should be. The place is usually brimming with people bcoz it is quite reasonable, but one should not compromise on food quality and hygiene in a trade off for price."
5.0,This has been our favourite place for the last 10+ years.. it never fails to impress us.. the chicken is tender and extremely authentic punjabi which is one of the favourite cuisines.. the owner is very courteous and friendly.. service is very good.. all chicken items are generally loaded with butter.. if you are calorie conscious then this is definitely not the place for you
4.0,"Had been here on a Sunday evening. It was crowded, depicting the positive feedbacks. Had only Veg. Soups are mediocre. Had ordered 3 varieties of soups. A prob faced was, they had mixed up the order with the other table. Before taking the spoon, we doubted and asked, which revealed it was Non-veg soups. Rotis were really good. Big enough to fill the tummy. The gravies tasted gud. Infact, the floor managers suggest gud options. The dessert was a compliment. Had hot jamoons and was amazing.. Overall 4/5."
3.5,Chicken chat was yummy.. Chicken briyani was very bad.. Mango lassi was good.. Ambience is on the average side.. Service was good..  Food-3.5 Ambience-3 Service-3.5
4.0,"Decent place to have north Indian cuisine esp. non veg. Service was quite slow but food tasted good. Chicken cream soup, chicken punjabi and missi roti are recommended."
1.0,There was cockroach in the food. The waiter just removes it from your food and says carry on. Terrible experience..never visiting again...bad
3.0,"Couldnot maintain the level of taste like HSR branch, been thrice and every time they hardly serve hot breads. Big yes to curry, chicken curry was too good but again dissatisfied woth Tandoori Roti."
5.0,"Amazing food is an understatement for the fare that is served up here. The ambience is a right mix of ethnic and retro. The food is finger licking good. The service is very prompt and pleasant. Recommendations - Chicken Tikka, Chicken Lababdar, Keema Naan. Definitely going back there to try more. Definitely value for money food. Keep it up!"
1.0,"One of the worst experience ever had so far! Planned on visiting this place on a special occasion and it turned out to ruin our day entirely! The taste of the food was shockingly worse! The Chicken starter wasn't fresh and it was just heated up and bought on to the table. Biryani was the worst ever tasted in any of the restaurants so far at Bangalore! An Immense waste of money! Would definitely never recommend this place to anyone! And if you really wish to opt this branch, good luck to you! #Regret!"
1.0,Had food delivered for lunch today. Removed closed to half a cup of oil from the chicken tikka masala & another 30 ml from the veg kofta. There was only 1 big piece of kofta in the dish. Very disappointed.
4.0,"I have recently visited this place with few friends... Coming to ambience, which was not very eye catching. Place is fine for casual outings. Coming to food and service. We ordered Dal makhani, paneer kalimirch and garlic naan and some other stuff. Food was amazing... It fully satisfied my appetite.. service was also fine..."
4.0,This is my go to place for north Indian food. Everytime I feel like eating paneer I straight away go to this place. Anyone who visits this place must try Amritsari kulcha and punjabi paneer.
4.0,"This place satisfies your tastebuds because it has some amazing dishes on the menu. Among the non vegetarian cuisine ,achaari Chicken and Mutton Roganjosh is a must try .And for vegetarians ,achaari paneer,bindi masala ,paneer butter masala is a must try here .The ambience is good. The place is usually crowded"
5.0,"Wow awsome/ teasty food we really enjoiyed a lots.. We try butter chicken, alu gobi, tanduri roti kulcha... Its mind-blowing teast and we try lussi butter milk it was awsm thank u so mch guys we come bacj again.. And kithcen's chefs all are great awsm... Thank u panjabi cuisine... I for got to take a phto lastly.. One"
5.0,One of my favorite place for North Indian food. I m a vegetarian and best paneer u can get in bangalore. Reasonable price and decent ambience
4.0,"Ramdom check in post doc visit on a friday night. Food turned out to be heavenly. We ordered daal makhani, butter chicken and tandoori roti.I had the best daal and butter chicken of my life here...felt like I m in Punjab...Must visit place...I would any day recommend this place over those fine dining fancy Indian cuisine resto...as they lose the rustic taste of the food..."
1.0,"It's best place to get stomach infection. We were on team lunch Thursday and with amazing food got complementary infection. Thanks for that. Zomato, can you please have ZERO rating system."
5.0,Really nice staff and quick service. Food is just delicious. Really really well.  Fulka was really soft. Pickle is just what my grandma  makes. Aaam panna is just what my grandma  makes.  THE place for some really nice North Indian cuisine.
1.0,"I'll keep it brief: I went to this restaurant with my friends; all of us got food poisoning the next day. Terrible food, terrible experience."
2.0,"Paneer items are good, in non-veg section food is very oily, the gravy is good though. Stick to tandoori items. Buttermilk is good. Ambiance is just average as it's a less costly food serving restaurant."
3.0,Quality of the food is not the way as it was.We ordered non-veg platter..The taste was okay and the food was not hot.The gravy items were also average.Lime sodas were overcharged. Overall the experience was okay. But the money spent wasn't worth it.
4.0,"Visited this place couple of time. Non veg and veg items are delicious. One of the best place for lunch and dinner. One can try Afghani chicken, chicken achari, Mutton curry and Paneer tikka."
4.0,"Ordered jeera rice, daal tadka, kadhai paneer and garlic naan and I'm easily able to add this to a go to place for satisfying Punjabi food cravings that I keep getting. Jeera rice and dal tadka were perfectly cooked and the restaurant made sure that the packing was perfect!"
5.0,"Well it's a small restaurant on the main road. They have valet assistance to have your cars parked.  The ambience is OK and seating is comfortable. The food was great the reason I am giving 5 stars is for their tandoori soya, although I am a hardcore non vegetarian but was blown away by their soya preparation. The authentic dishes sarson ka saagh and Makai ki roti were really nice. And to finish off with a nice maghai pan made the afternoon enjoyable."
3.0,It's a decent place for Punjabi cuisine. But I feel the meat used for a few of the items was not fresh and hence if didn't match the taste- expectations. But the fish kabab was on point. Most of the items are delicious but the amount of oil used might draw the attention of US government soon. Quantity is good but I feel this place can do so much better
3.0,"I had heard such good reviews about this place. And after going through zomato I was like heck yeah let's go.  Made a reservation and reached there on time. No one greeted us, served us water or anything for a longtime.  Ordered paneer Tikka, veg kofta, garlic Naan and kulcha.  Paneer Tikka tasted great. It had an unique flavour to it. Our main course was average not to brag about.  Service was painfully slow and staff was not attentive at all. Ambience is quite basic.  So I am definitely not recommending this place. But if you happen to go there definitely try their paneer Tikka."
5.0,"One of the best Punjabi cuisines one can get here that too down south! Ambiance is good, in-fact rooftop. Service is also courteous & friendly.  Tender Meat minced in their spices adds the flavour almost to traditional Punjabi food."
4.0,What a comfort! The old familiar butter chicken paired with their choor choor naan and daal makhni. A classic tale of good food and flavour on the plate. Additional benefit is the value for money.This restaurant offers a tough competition in the realm of Punjabi cuisine. A must visit if you are craving some Desi Delight.
3.0,We did not like the food.. food is too much oily .. price is ok but taste is not worth .. ambience also not happening like as shown in the pic.. very old setup. I regret my decision to have lunch here.
5.0,"Awesome food. Had Mushroom Tikka, Kadhai Paneer, Garlic Naan and Manchow Soup. Worth every penny. Paneer is very soft. Mushroom is very tasty."
4.0,Went here for a team lunch. Food was tasty. We went to their rooftop. Just felt a bit overpriced for what they serve. But otherwise the place is good and worth visiting.
5.0,Such a nice place for north indian food. Really liked the food never had this kind of food ever in Bangalore. Must try once.  Good job guys
5.0,We can make out from the quality of the food if its an authentic punjabi restaurant or not. Paneer lovers must try this place. You won't be disappointed. Have never had this kind of paneer before. This is by far the best.  Tandoori gobi - 4/5 Peshwari Paneer tikka - 5/5 Shahi Paneer - 5/5 Carrot Halwa - 5/5
5.0,"The staffs in this business have an important role to play, sometime even if your product is not out of the world it can continue to sale just because you have an amazing salesman. Mr. Rambahadur is one such staff who knows the art very well.  Overall very nice food and courteous staffs. Nagada Chicken & the phulka combination is a must try."
2.0,After 2 successful visit we visited this place 3rd time and we were very disappointed. Food quality was not at all good. Breads was not cooked properly.
5.0,"It is not one of the best but I would say the best place to dine for Punjabi food in Bangalore and it does full justice to it's name, I was actually a lil sad I discovered this gem after so long.  The ambience, their cutlery and the Punjabi songs in the background, give it that DESI Vibe. Jitne pyaar se yahaan khaana khilate Hain or jaisa vadiya khaana hai lagta hi nai aap Bangalore mein ho, lagta hai ki dilli ya Chandigarh kahin baith ke kha rahe ho.  Even the food is as good as it can get, authentic taste , freshly made and served with love. It has the best butter chicken you get in all of Bangalore ( and you can trust me on this, I've literally eaten at thousands of places all over town looking for the best butter chicken, but this is closest to the real deal), the chicken is soft and fresh, their rotis are great. We also had Chicken Malaamal and Chicken Chaat, which were good too. Washed it all down with lassi ( served in steel glass, again giving you Desi feels) and ended with hot, melt in mouth Gulab Jamuns.  My tummy was really happy after eating here, all in all Dil Khush Kar Diya Ji, Swaad aa gya!"
3.0,"The food is tasty if you are only considering the taste. Being a first timer I had no idea how much oil they will pour into the dishes. The amount of oil added in each dish is so prominent that you wonder whether the name of the dish is what it is meant to be. e.g Palak Paneer should be renamed to oil Palak paneer. So those who don't consider health it is one of the tastiest destinations in the city I can bet. But just a suggestion to the restaurant, the amount of oil you use can be decreased drastically without compromising on taste."
5.0,"Was introduced to Punjabi Rasoi by a friend more than a year ago, and have been a regular here ever since. Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken Masala are excellent. Have tried Paneer Tikka, the paneer is super soft and melts in your mouth  Also the best place for Dal Makhani as well. A must try place."
5.0,Hands down the best Punjabi food. The paneer they serve is so delicious and perfectly cooked. Must try is Kadai paneer and punjabi chicken. Id definitely recommend this place. Worth every penny.
4.0,"Just one of the place while exploring bangalore searching for good north indian food. The place is amazing, its situated at a very well, calm and quite location. The menu serves you authentic north Indian delicacies & the plus point is there staff so helpful and serving. Theyll happily guide you through the menu of your taste and will serve you the food as well. Thumbs up to the place!"
4.0,Nice ambience.Authentic Punjabi dishes.Must try sweet Lassi.Food is avrg.Good service.Stuffed Naan and paratha are yum.Veg Puloa will make you remember your home.
4.0,"Many restaurants claim to be authentic Punjabi but this is the true Punjabi Rasoi in every sense of the word.  Consistency in taste is the biggest USP of this place, every dish has the  same great taste even after years, the waiters there are also the same faces :)   Mine and my wife's favourite has been the Chicken Chaat for us and Nargisi Chicken for the kids in starters, the Chicken Rara is a must - try it with their butter naan or Kulcha. Not a big fan of Lassi but this place serves one of the best according to ones who devour it. The best reason again to go to this place is that you are never disappointed with what you order - the quantity is also decent, taste is great, they also have a in-house Paan wala."
5.0,"A Must Visit Place for all Punjabi-food lovers in Bangalore. One of the best places in Bangalore to have north Indian food. Have been there multiple times and it had been a treat always. Everything ranging from starters, mains or even lassi will give you an authenticPunjabiflavor. Try Chicken Punjabi which is my favorite here."
4.0,"So I ordered (from this place through swiggy) dal makhani, amritsari kulcha and pudina parantha and got green chutney, vinegar dipped onions complimentary! The moment you open the dal, believe me the aroma was so good and so punjabi that it took me to delhi :D it was just yummmmm Also kulcha and parantha were appropriately cooked. If you ask me pudina parantha was better than kulcha, because they burnt that (kulcha) a bit. Overall food was cooked to perfection, making it my go-to (read it as order-out) place for Punjabi food :))"
4.0,"The place was lit in yellowish color and I felt the tables are really close but it didn't matter cause there weren't many people when we went. Also, the tables are really small and it's not very comfortable to eat. Coming to the food, we ordered hot and sour chicken soup which was okay-not bad. The masala pappad was really really good. Spicy and sour. And then the tandoori roti and veg kofta were really awesome and little spicy. especially the roti was really soft. The pineapple raitha was extraordinary. So far the best I had. I liked those small onions and some kinda chutney kept at the table. The food was good in here."
4.0,"Looks a little shady from the outside but inside its good enough. Taste is good with that Punjabi flavour. Steel utensils and Punjabi music add to the feel. Non veg prices are genuine, veg are not. Service is fast. Must try - Nargisi Chicken Con - Drinks are highly over priced."
5.0,Best place in town for authentic Punjabi food for both veg and non veg.everything from sarso ka saag maki ki roti to mung daal halwa everything thing is finger licking good.  There dal makhni and paneer malamaal are must try. I love the chutney and sirca wala pyaaz (only place in Bangalore that servers it I found so far ) Thank me later !
4.0,Been there for lunch and ordered daal makhni and kulcha. Daal makhni was good. Kulcha was just ok. Again ordered a butter naan and it was good. Vinegar onion and green chutney were fresh. Mouth freshener was a hit in the end. Overall good experience. Enjoyed.
4.0,Service was good n nice ambience .. I tried mutton rogan josh it was just amazing..Nice resturant for frnds n family for good north indian dishes
4.0,"This is now my go to place when my South Indian pallete craves some punjabi food. We always order the Afghani Chicken for starters...and Garlic Butter Naans with the main course . Their Butter Chicken is quite impressive, but if you want to try something new, different and absolutely amazing, I suggest the Nagada Chicken"
4.0,The food was good.chicken chat was superb Please go early or you have to wait.the place was little cramped and the music was little loud.makkiki roti is good.
4.0,"We ordered paneer shashlik, veg kabab, naan,paneer lababdaar.. everything was great.. awesome taste.. except for Punjabi lassi. Food was great but not lassi.we expected a authentic Punjabi lassi but it was nothing but curd mixed sugar hence reducing 1 rating.otherwise food was excellent.paneee quality is good"
4.0,"Food was good. Liked the chicken briyani. Service was really good, a bit slow bit. The pineapple raita was not so great but really happy with the starters both veg and non vegetarian."
4.0,"Craving some grease or just hungover, just head to this place. Amazing north Indian food. My go to place for Punjabi food cravings. Top picks achari chicken, musallam chicken, butter naan, carrot halwa and masala cola. Caution food is extremely unhealthy.."
4.0,Love the butter chicken here ! This is my go to place when ever I crave north indian food. I have mostly home delivered the food so won't comment too much on the ambience. Overall good food :)
3.0,"Ambiance - 4/5  Food  3.5/5  Service - 4/5  The food is delicious and the menu is quite elaborate, making sure majority of the common Punjabi food items are also present."
5.0,One of the Best Punjabi food in Bengaluru....#veg... must try there paneer lababdar n dal makhani... The green chutney that they serve on side is amazing
4.0,Must try Shahi Paneer Korma if you love medium spicy and semi-sweet gravies. The staff is very friendly. The decor is elegant and sober. Do visit this place if you like north Indian. One of the better places to dine in Bangalore.
3.0,This is one place that you could visit when you crave for a pleasing Punjabi cuisine. I'm almost certain that you will enjoy this place. The curries are rich and the breads are nice and fluffy.  Overall a good place to be in for an occasional dining.
1.0,"I have been always a fan of Punjabi food and being a Punjabi myself have visited this restaurant couple of times. But, last evening's experience was horrible. We had ordered for cream of chicken soup, tomato shorba, hara bhara kebabs, chicken kalmi, Dal, garlic naan, plain naan, pineapple raita, pudhina chicken. Good things first - Service was good by the servers and on my request gave a small bowl of curd for my kid as well. Too an extent Dal and curd were good. What went wrong- chicken soup was very sweet in taste. Tomato shorba was more like rasam and had a tempering of garlic. Chicken kalmi was ok types. Pudhina chicken was the worst of the lot as it's spices were not cooked properly and on my request the server took it back and made it little better by re cooking but by that time I had lost the appetite. Coming to breads it was hot but was very chewy.  When I complained about the same thing to manager he said, no one has complained to me since evening let me get it checked. Also, he said being a Saturday cooks might have messed up, but to be honest it was a very lame excuse and not acceptable.  My conclusion is that either their cooks have changed or management is no more interested in having customers returning back to them."
5.0,"Went here for lunch on a Friday and Ive never been so happy. Their food is so good! We ordered Achari chicken for starters. Butter chicken, mutton roganjosh and bread basket for the main course. Everything was delightful! The butter chicken especially was the best Ive had so far in Bangalore! Will be coming back for more!!"
3.0,"Had been to this place a couple of times, and it's one if the best places to have Punjabi / north indian cuisine. The menu is very original and has lot of options for veg and non veg. Their paneer dishes are some of the best. Love their Indian breads and the Chicken dishes too.  The menu is fairly priced and the quantities of the dishes are big. A must try for ppl who love hearty punjabi food."
4.0,Ambience- 4 Food -4 Staff-3.5 as they are always in a hurry to serve other tables Calcutta ( Kolkata) pan was yum! A nice place to try some punjabi food.
4.0,Very authentic punjabi food! Well cooked and tastes a lot like what we get in Punjab. Good service. Sometimes some waiters will try to cross sell - just be firm on what you want thank listen to their sales advice. Have been there two times - have loved their food.
4.0,"Really nice restaurant with typical Punjabi food. Ambience is also nice, its a rooftop restaurant. Ordered butter chicken and tandoori chicken and really liked it"
1.0,"Very very bad food, I never expect this from Punjabi Rasoi, price is high but food is unhygienic too oily, roti and nan ware very burnt and test was not good."
1.0,never order biryani here.. it was the worst I ever had in bangalore  no taste no spice nothing only rice not properly cooked moreover the raita served was not going with biryani
4.0,This place gave us a good smile on our face..  keep it simple Try butter chicken with butter Naan and have a glass of lassi.. Thats completes your perfect meal..
5.0,"I visited this place randomly last month with my couple of college friends on Sunday afternoon to have good lunch.  I tried food at RT Nagar branch of Punjabi Rasoi and liked it very much, so thought of giving this one a try too. And believe me this was also really good.  Without any prior booking we arrived at this place and within 20 minutes we got the seat without any trouble.  We tried these items : Bhindi Masala - We saw in recommended section on Zomato and Service guy recommmended too, so went ahead and ordered it. And it was really tasty as mentioned by others  Paneer Dish - Paneer was soft and good in taste. Sorry, I forgot dish name.  Garlic Naan - My friends liked it very much.  Butter Naan - It was prepared well. It was not burnt from any side.  Butter Roti - Like other items this was good too.  Sweet Lassi - Not like proper punjabi lassi which you get at Haveliof Jalandhar but it was really tasty.  Overall good experience at this branch too."
4.0,"This one's been around for quite some time. Pretty popular for their yummy North Indian food. Meal time finds this place teeming with people...so you better book a table. Be it starters, main course or desserts, Punjabi Rasoi is a go to place that you wouldn't regret going to. Courteous staff and prompt service .... Enjoy!!"
4.0,"If you are paneer favourite, you should be here. Ordered paneer achari which was decent starter.Paneer malamaal was yum. Tandoori roti was soft while garlic naan wasn't. Sweet lassi was yum. My non vegertarian friends were happy with these items than nonveg which they had here. The ambience, seating should be improved and air condition should be added. Rating is only for paneer"
4.0,"If you want to taste authentic North-Indian food then go no further than The Punjabi Rasoi. The ambiance coupled with the authentic taste will have you in good spirits.  Coming to ambiance, its kinda two-leveled inside. On the right once you enter, you can see a yellow wall decorated with mirrors and mostly handy-crafts. Turn around and you will see some witty one liners that are synonymous with northern part of India like ""Kade Hass Wi Lia Karo"" , these will lighten your mood for sure.  In Non-veg, tried Chicken Kadai, Chicken Jalfarzi and Chicken Lababdar and loved it. The good part is, you can customize your order and can increase the number of pieces you want to add on to. In Veg, Paneer tikka was delicious. The spice-level was just about perfect.  In bread options loved Missi Paratha,Methi Paratha, Makki di Roti and regular Garlic naans. One word to describe these rotis is ""Ghee,Ghee and more ghee"" again that's traditional and common up-north to make your rotis swim in ghee.  Service was pretty fast and the staff was courteous and professional. Had good time with friends and certainly recommend it for a date with North Indian cuisines."
2.0,The punjabi rasoi has been recommended by my frnd who works in swiggy...we entered der at 9.0 clock nd it was too crowded on a saturday ni8....we have to wait fr d table and finally we got one.We ordered chicken chat as a starter which was recommended by d staff and punjabi chicken as a main course and butter naan....coming to the taste the chicken chat was awful....the whole masala was raw and the chutney was also not good...the punjabi chicken was d worst one....i have not eaten dis type of punjabi chicken ever...chicken was not properly cooked....naan was okk okk....and the worst part of the restaurant....the staffs were not able to manage the crowd....we have given an ordinary steel glass fr drinking and a jug of water....interestingly the jug was leaking....will not suggest anyone to go der....worst punjabi restaurant in bangalore
3.0,"I like the paneer food from Punjabi rasoi much. I have been to this branch many times. What I feel is they not maintain the taste consistency always same. Sometimes I get spoiled curries, even today I ordered paneer lababdar which was too bad. So I gave 3 rating. This rating is from my past 2 years experience in Punjabi rasoi, Indra Nagar."
4.0,"This place came recommended by friends as the cheap (economical) and best place for Punjabi food. We visited this place on a Sunday afternoon and there was a queue. Which itself talks volumes about the place. We were OK with the table which we got in the corner with chairs but the staff insisted if we can wait for 2 more minutes so we can get a table with the sofa as we had a toddler with us. That really was beautiful.  We ordered aachari chicken for starters, chicken patiyala for main course and bread basket. We even ordered sweet lassi as that completes any Punjabi meal.  The aachari chicken tasted heavenly but it was bit raw in the inside. The patiyala chicken was good along with the breads, though the naan could have been better. The lassi was okish for a Punjabi place, also I was disappointed to see the lassi glass being the regular steel glass. At least they could have given a bigger glass.  All in all, a good place to dine in. Will visit again."
4.0,"If you are a sucker for Indian/Punjabi food then you  must try this place. Although the place looks small on the outside, it has a decent ambience.  I ordered for chicken chaat , butter chicken, tandoori roti and butter naan.  I have had better butter chicken but their chicken Chaat is a must try! LOVED IT!"
2.0,Got take away from the Indira Nagar branch. In comparison with the RT branch the food standards are not upto the mark. We had ordered Methi muttur malai and it was sweeter than kheer.. the butter chicken was equally sweeter. Still a fan but for RT Nagar branch only.
5.0,Omygod the butter chicken and paneer tikka here is legendary !! Its like comfort food to the max!! Ordering in works best because restaurant is sometimes really busy and crowded .. that wouldnt stop me from eating here anyways ! Best punjabi style in Indiranagar Ive eaten till date
4.0,"If you want to have some authentic punjabi food in Indirangar without burning big hole in your pocket, then this is the one place you should give a try. Ambience is not very fancy as people mainly come here for good food. Their veg and non-veg dishes are equally good. Their lassi is just lip-smacking. Service is little slow which can be improved. Food-4/5 Service-3.5/5 Ambience-3.5/5"
4.0,"I had been there with family on 14th April 2018 we had try tangri kebab that was awesome in taste but one small suggestion don't add white sauce its blanket real taste of kebab after that in main course we ordered Punjabi panneer, chicken lababdar and chicken tawa . chicken tawa wasn't that much good as compare to other item which we had . Ambience was average and it also cost affective the item are not over priced . overall it's a good restaurant in indiranagar . I would love visit again and try other chicken items"
3.0,Taste of this place is good. Expected better ambience considering the pricing.  If you eat here expect to feel the heaviness in the stomach till next day.  Lassi was good. Chicken masalam was the best dish out of what all we ordered.  Service was quick.
4.0,This place has graduated a lot of times past couple of years. The food remains the same even though the ambience changes. The staffs sense of humour is up the roof. But guys you need to know when we need you the most. yes after dessert we still love to have soaf. Don't save it for the other guests. Punjabirasoi
2.5,"Went there with a craving for Choor-choor naan. Started with a veg-platter for starter, which was mostly filled with potatoes and cauliflower. It was tasty though.Our mood was spoiled after seeing the naans. They were just stuffed-naans.So either they don't know how to make choor-choor naan or I was befooled :-(.Would like to say, whatever we had was tasty and quality of the food was good as well."
4.0,"Food is good. We ordered dal makhani, garlic naan, tandoori roti and bitter milk. Dish was awesome to fill our taste buds. Service was good and waiter  was taking very good care of us."
5.0,Great food.. we ordered kadai paneer and butter chicken.. taste was authentic north Indian.. plus the show stealer is the home made am ka achaar and amrood ki chutney.. must try place I usually visit this place often
3.0,"After searching for a good North Indian restaurant I landed to this place with my colleagues. Knowing the fact the location is Indiranagar, I was expecting good food. But I was disappointed.  Food : Below Average - chicken dish hardly had any pieces of chicken. Dal Makhani was not cooked properly.  Service: Poor - the staff really need to learn how to talk to their customers. Not once but even on other tables I heard the customers arguing with the staff.  I would really appreciate if the management concentrate on training the staff and work on the ambiance of the restaurant, it really needs an revamp."
3.0,"Enjoyable!!  We had been here on a Saturday night for dinner. It wasnt that crowded, so we could get our table. We started directly with the main course. I ordered for a chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and stuffed paratha. The chicken tikka masala was rich and tasty. The naan and stuffed paratha were just okay. It was a good dinner."
1.0,I didn't received my order. yet it shows order as delivered.  Even the delivery guy is not picking up the phone. Disappointed. Didn't expect such a poor behavior from one of the finest restaurants in town.
1.0,Overpriced restaurant which doesnt match with their customer service. Service is very bad with rude staff. atleat you would have to call 3-4 times for anything you want. Food was average not a authentic punjabi food. Would never recommend if you dont want to spoil your mood!!
3.0,"went there for the second time. The service was very slow. We had a table booking and yet when we reached, all tables were occupied. We had to explicitly ask for drinking water. In food we ordered butter phulkas which were completely cold and we had to send them back to be heated. In re-order of phulka, it was cold again, then when they brought hot one, it was without butter and this thing happened twice. Also, one of the paneer gravies, which was marked spicy in the menu was rather to the sweeter side. Disappointment in the revisit. Prefer to visit at times where it is almost empty as was the case with my first visit."
5.0,"Best place to have north india food.best dish in veg.makki ki roti ,sarson ka saag...lassi., missi roti.In non veg kadai chicken .If you want to enjoy the taste of proper north indian food..best place to visit"
2.5,"We came here after attending #ytff and were really really hungry . For starters we had aloo hariyali and  panner tikka .  And for main course we had paneer pasanda, panner butter masala , mix veg , garlic naan ,Butter roti, anddddd (phewww we are like bhukkads ) tandoori roti.  We liked the starters very much but the main course was really below average . Aloo hariyali is a must have here . Garlic naan was too chewy and felt as if we were chewing rubber . I have had better panner pasanda and paneer butter masala . Butter roti and phulka were good .  Now the food we liked the most . GREEN CHUTNEY here is awesome , i think they should serve it a handi instead of a small bowl ."
2.0,"Great food but not so great service. If you order non veg and veg together, expect the latter to arrive at least half an hour late.  You order dal tadka, and expect a dal makhni.  Also expect a ton of argument if you rise a concern.   Overall, the food doesn't taste great with so much of confusion on delivery."
2.5,Was good earlier - but quality seems to have reduced now. Ordered food online and wasn't great. Will not order again. Paneer in particular was horrible.
2.0,Its no more the old punjabi rasoi with great taste. They need to focus more on improving the quality of food instead of expanding the business.
3.0,Paneer was like rubber
1.0,Ordered boneless. Still got bones.
4.5,"This is completely because of the quality of the food . Ambeince is also nice but food is awesome, it's all finger licking food. Be it chicken chat, malamaal chicken, the variety of Indian breads or lassi. If you are looking for some awesome authentic Punjabi food then you must head to this restaurant. We have visited multiple times and it is always our best Punjabi food destination."
4.0,Tasty food and has variety of veg and non-veg dishes. Ambience is good and hygienic place and need to improve on service. They take lot of time to serve order and they wont guide on choosing order
3.5,"North Indians paradise. Love non veg curry items this is the place. Service needs to improve a little other than that I like everything. Ambience, crowd and food."
5.0,Good ambience. Best restaurant in the area with good quality of food. Exceptional service done by Amit and Shivam. Arrange surprise for both of us.
5.0,Love this place. Awesome food and good service. Finger licking and fresh paneer. The soups are also awesome. This place has never disappointed. One of my favorite north indian joints in Bangalore. A must try.
4.0,"Been to this place many times both for lunch and dinner. Stopping by for a review for the first time. The entrance and the look of the place is a little shabby from the outside but once inside it's a decent place. They do get a lot of guests and the place can get busy and the service can slow down a bit. But the food is good and that's what matters. You can't really go wrong with any of their dishes, but I'd recommend their Non veg platter as the must try, as you get to taste most of their good items on a platter without ordering too many."
4.5,"For a heavy tummy delight ,hit this place . Chicken Achari , chicken chat and Afghani chicken are must try staters. Mushroom fried rice is good too .Lassi to sign off . Desserts are average ."
4.5,"Food - 4.5 Packaging - 4.5 Delivery - 5.0 Value for money - 5.0 My friend Shivam Pandey, had won 10000 rupees courtesy of Zomato in a competition that was hosted by radio one that allowed us to order from any restaurant for said amount. So we were lucky enough to eat to our hearts content from this lovely restaurant. And we definitely did take a lot of dishes, so much so that I am just gonna rate them individually so that you can decide the dishes worth trying here. First let me just list all the items we ordered.

5.0,"Food- 5 Delivery-5  We have ordered around 11K food through some online delivery app. This restaurant actually prepared soo much food soo fast that I never expected it to prepare that fast.  Food- Coming to food. It was just mind blowing. Must try place for North Indian cuisine. I would love to visit this place and taste their food at their outlet itself. Thanks to this place for super fast preparation of food and super tasty food. I like Paneer Achaari and baby corn tandoori in starters, everything was perfect in main course but Sarso ka Saag was the best, in breads almost everything was nice. Desserts were not that great. They don't have many options in dessert, it would be great if they include some more dessert.   Would be adding even more details about ambience and service once I visit that place personally. Expecting it to be good.  Note- Food listing would be long enough if I write down all the food items. Have attached the bill for the same. :)  Loved it :)"
4.0,"Ambiance - 3.5/5 Food - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5 Value For Money - 4/5  Ambiance - Being a regular customer, i have seen the restaurant adapt and change the decor. Its a good thing for a restaurant to change as per the market. The ambiance of the place is welcoming and good place for a family dinner.  Food - Punjabi Rasoi serves one of the best punjabi cuisine in bangalore. Majority of the starters are spectacular and perfectly cooked. My personal favourites being Paneer and Chicken starters. I would preferably stay away from the rice dishes in this place, as they are average. The Main course curries and the starters are to die for here and to finish the meal with custom after mint which is the perfect finishing touch.  Service - The service in terms of both delivery and dine in is quick. The staff is courteous and well mannered and also greet you with a smile, even on crowded days.  What I Ordered - Kheer, Chicken Lollipop, Kadai Paneer, Tandoori Roti, Kalmi Kebab, Mutton Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken, Punjabi Salt Lassi, Punjabi Sweet Lassi, Gajjar Ka Halwa, Dum Aloo, Jeera Rice, Butter Naan, Makki Ki Roti, Garlic Naan, Aloo Stuffed Paratha, Chicken Tandoori, Gobi Tandoori, Paneer Achari, Afghani Chicken, Chicken Malai Tikka, Hara Bara Kebab, Chana Masala, Sarson Ka Saag, Kaju Masala, Butter Paneer Masala, Methi Malai Mutter, Paneer Bhurji, Butter Chicken and Babycorn Manchurian."
4.5,"Awesome restaurant, nice staff, a real Punjabi restaurant. Sarso ka saag and makke ki roti are some must try dishes. Food has an unique taste."
3.5,Being a vegetarian I was excited to see soya in the menu. Ordered soya tikka masala and some soya starter. The taste was great. Kulchas also tasted great. Ordered vegetable pulao which was the only disappointment. overall it was a good experience
3.5,"Be here if you want to have some lip smacking punjabi food.we were here on Saturday evening for dinner around 8.30 n it wasn't much crowded. Staff are friendly n polite and attend to your queries patiently. We ordered lassi ,jaljeera, paneer tikka for starter. Lassi's quantity n quality was good. Jaljeera too was nice. Paneer tikka was the best I had. Soft marinated n barbecued paneer n veggies ,loved the mustard flavour. For main course we had dum aloo n phulkas. Dum aloo was punjabi style, mild spicy. Overall a nice place for dinner/lunch."
3.5,"I went to their rooftop space,  which is nice and airy.  The food is delicious and the menu is quite elabrate,  making sure majority of the common Punjabi food items are also present.  I found the music to be a bit too loud,  making it difficult to have a conversation and the service is a little slow."
3.0,"Over all average restaurant. Food, ambience and staff. Most of the crowd was family crowd. Butter chicken was OK. Biryani can improve a lot."
3.0,"This place has nice ambience and service, Food quality is also pretty decent. A bit expensive but good option to visit if you are craving for some north indian food."
1.5,"All our team lunches are cursed! This one was no better. Everything right from the starters till the lassi was nothing worth mentioning! Oh sorry, there was no lassi available in a Punjabi restaurant!!! My friend pointed out the green chutney and the hara bhara kabab was somewhat good!  Definitely not worth the money or time, the ambience or the decor is nothing great either! Don't even get me started on the music."
4.0,"Good food and good service. Chicken Achari was a good one in non veg starters. Chicken Rogan gosh and chicken kadai were the perfect accompaniment for the butter rotis. Kheer was not as great as expected. Could be improved. And importantly staff service is good. Overall, a good filling dinner at Punjabi Rasoi."
3.5,This place is decent. Not very great. We had some rotis and chicken curry. Don't exactly remember the name. But quantity was very less when compared to the price.
1.0,"We went to this restaurant, ordered food,their service was worst. For single order they were taking half an hour to serve, not at all happy with the service."
4.5,"Authentic Punjabi food. Dal makhani is tastiest ever. And don't miss Aam panha. Very good ambience. You will love the place when you enjoy your food with Hindi, Punjabi songs."
4.0,"Hi, had a good experience of dining and you served a yummy food especially loved Amritsari kulcha. Food - veg and non veg is served and tasted veg Ambience - Good and pleasing. Service - Good service. Photos updated here are old ones and it's a right place for having a get together with your family or your office colleague. Try this if you are in Indiranagar and not getting any options of place to hunt your hunger."
5.0,Always make the chicken dishes taste so good. Variety of non-veg dishes are served here. Always come here to eat great food with friends. Delicious food :)
4.0,One of the best place to have authentic Punjabi food.Staff is courteous and food tastes great.Have tried many paneer dishes all tastes awesome.Am a vegetarian so can definitely vouch for veg food what I had there.
4.5,"I love this place in Indiranagar!! It has been my favourite since 2011, when I first shifted to Bangalore and lived in a PG with limited food options, this place was my sanctum for ""good"", ""tasty"", ""real"" food. Punjabi food is the one of the few cuisines which I consider as real food and this place did just that. No need to recommend dishes, almost anything you eat there is delicious. However, to name a few, chicken hara bhara kebab, malai kofta, chicken rara, lassi etc. Ambiance is simple yet clean. Place is usually crowded. Must visit for a good dose of heavenly food."
1.0,Serving roti without proper facilities to wash the hands. Indian food isnt eat with fork and spoon. Westernising at the cost of hygiene. Not cool.
4.0,"Food 4.0 Ambience 3.5  Service 4.0  Been there with my family it's was okay.. but I like there chicken seekha kabab,butter chicken. The ambience was quite okay.. all over okay experience.."
1.0,there was no complimentary kheer
3.5,"Been there with my friend. Food is okay. Especially the briyani, quantity wise it's satisfying. But taste wise they have to make it aromatic as authentic punjabi one."
4.5,"Went here last weekend for lunch. The food was really good, we had paneer tikka masala and dal makhni with amritsari kulcha and it was just amazing."
1.0,late delivery with compromised quality of food
1.0,"Shame on you guys , I had to re heat the food to eat it . Such a pathetic food and service , the delivery boy was rude he was angry because I ordered food so late .... Such a shame   Worst service and food quality ever   Beaware guys please don't order food after 9:30"
1.0,"Head waiter is very arrogant, doesn't like to answer any question, infact he would ask you a question rather than answering.  Don't expect any hospitality from the staff. Will never visit this place again."
3.5,Have been to this place a lot of times. Did have bad experiences couple of times .. nevertheless great punjabi food .. I like their paneer curries with roti. In starters I like hara bhara kabab.. service can be improved a lot ..
4.0,Pretty Good North Indian Place to Have Lunch\Dinner. I personally like their Lassi and Paranthe. Always worth a visit in Indiranagar if you are craving for some good Punjabi Food.
4.0,"100% satisfaction to Craving for North indian food. My recommendation is there Non Veg items and for vegetarians malai kofta is a must try.  Huge sitting space, Quick service, amazing food. Perfect combo for family outing."
3.5,"The quality and quantity of food is good. Like a Punjabi, Dil kholke khilao! It's a nice place to go for a hearty meal. I had been here with my friends and the food was not disappointing at all. They have some really good options in chicken main course."
4.5,"One of the oldest Punjabi restaurants in Bangalore, Indiranagar, this place holds a special place in my heart, thanks to the 'Dal-Makhni'. You guys have always given us memories with your food. No matter where I am or whenever I came back to Bangalore, the first restaurant that comes to mind in the middle of the night, is yours! Thank You.  Your food is great, your waiters are the sweetest, your paanwalaalways gave us the best pieces. thank you!"
4.5,"The food and ambience was great. Best biryani I had in Bangalore.( Well, I have been here only for a month or so). One of the few restaurants I aim to visit again."
3.5,A nice place. Good ambience. The food was also good. Lip smacking panneer. Really soft n crispy nice rotis. Starters were nice. Reasonable price. But expected something more nice.
4.0,"Great restraunt with authentic punjabi food. You go there try there lassi, kadai chicken, patiala chicken Also do try their makki di roti and saag really good taste."
1.0,"Very unprofessional management. They are not capable of handling large orders. It is very much expected that food items will be missing in case you are ordering 40+ items (Yes, I generallyorder for my team and some of them will be left disappointed because of this). And coming to the best part, they are not ready to compensate also. They simply say ""Hum kuchh nahi kar sakte"". Are you kidding me.....?? You should maintain some sort of decency while talking to your customers. After all, you exist because of us."
3.0,"I have been here twice. The place is always full and taste is really punjabi-ish. But service has been awful. Noone cares to take the order, unless you remind them 3-4 times. Even after that, they mismatch the order and bring someone else's order. Service was a big let down. Apart from that, this place was decent."
4.0,"Location : Indiranagar, perfect. Ambiance : Nothing extraordinary. They serve in steel dishes which adds up to the feel of having North Indian food. Food: One of the few places in Bangalore serving good butter chicken :D  Have been here/ordered quite a few times. Go ahead with butter chicken and daal makhani. Less scope of disappointment there :D"
4.0,Have been here three times and food has always been good. Paneer gravy dishes are the best. The paneer is so soft... The menu is short on desserts.   Ambience is just fine (good lighting in the evening) but nothing special.
4.0,"Food:4 Service:4 Ambience:3.5  I would say one of the best punjabi cuisine restaurants in town.ordered hot and sour chicken soup,paneer tikka,malai kofta and methi roti. The food was really delicious but the malai kofta was too sweet for our palate.all in all a good experience."
5.0,".Preety good place for north indian food. I visited the indranagar outlet. we odered some chicken malai starter which are awasome and main course we odered chicken lababdar, roti. butternaan, all food was on the batter side of good.. like the ambiance being off big spaecious... over all not a bad experience... we visited again... @"
2.0,Very bad and slow service. The waiter were unprofessional and were not responding like waiter should respond. Food was good and tasty. We had ordered chicken curry.
2.5,"The place has a minimalistic look with two levels. We were seated in the lower level. Both levels have sofas and chairs. We were seated promptly. The menu offers typical Punjabi fare. We ordered lassi and buttermilk. The lasso was pretty decent but buttermilk was below Average.  In soups we ordered tomato and sweet and sour. Tomato was ok but sweet n sour soup was too spicy. In starters, we ordered paneer took a which was decent. Main course veg has mostly paneer curries so we ordered kadai paneer which was good and then daal tadka which was too oily! In rotis, we ordered phulka which was too thick and methi paratha which was good. We didn't find desserts interesting so we didn't order. Rates are low. Service is okay. Not worth a try!"
3.5,"I went to this place today for lunch to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi. The place had a good ambiance though nothing extraordinary about it. We had ordered for Jaljeera, Fresh Lime Water and Masala Papad at the start. I didn't like the Masala Papad as it was not at all crispy nor the Jaljeera which was a bit sweet; the Fresh Lime tasted just about okay. For the main course we had ordered for Phulka, Butter Naan and Paneer Butter Masala. I must say I was really impressed with the taste of the Paneer Butter Masala. The naan and phulka were also very soft. The service was okay though I didn't like the fact that the starter and the main course was given at the same time. Overall I had a good experience but there is scope for improvement. I will definitely recommend this place to other people."
4.5,"Enjoyed being there for dinner . We ordered Mushroom Tikka, Paneer Punjabi and Malai Kofta. All dishes tasted great and have certainly Punjabi flavor and aroma. Service was also fast and prompt. The only thing they need to improve is cleanliness of their washroom and I request management to pay attention to that."
1.5,"We ordered a large meal for ~10 people via Zomato. Since it was raining, we assumed the delivery would be late - however, this took almost 2 hours. Even then 1 dish was missing (which we had to ask them to send later). The biggest disappointment was the food - in particular all the north Indian curries. I have never had food with sooo much oil. It was greasy, tasteless and unhealthy. We had ordered a year or so ago - the quality was much better than this. Hope they improve soon - otherwise they will lose more customers like me."
3.0,Ordered butter chicken and was expecting a Punjabi touch to it because that is how they sell themselves. But sadly it's nowhere near that. Not going here again.
1.0,"It's the third try at this place, first time the chicken was stale in the curry !!!!! second time the chicken was fresh but they gave a plastic cover piece roasted along the roti, my friend called the manager to show that it isnt right to feed polythene mixed rotis, to our astonishment the manager said and I quote "" it's alright, it happens, I'll change it"" . There was not even a word of sorry from him and did not even make an attempt to assure us that it will not occur again !!!!!!! Third and the last time, ordered today chicken curry and the rotis, again the stale chicken which are like the size of sumo wrestlers were sent, which was thrown out on the first instance of contact with the taste buds.   They have this 'don't give a f**k attitude' but they have to mend thier ways to reach the true potential and please please source fresh chicken which are cut in small pieces for human consumption."
2.5,"We went there for our team lunch,they served the starters and veg starters were totally low quality specially the gobi and the mushroom  which was simply boiled and served without any taste.It was horrible in taste. However the rating is only given for the main course which tasted nice."
3.0,"Good to have a quickie or dinner.A decent place to have some good time. Food tried: North Indian Service: Good Ambience: Ok Accessibility: Easily discoverable, resides in main city area."
1.5,"Very poor service. They don't even pour drinking water in your glass leave apart serving food properly. Also, they have some weird horrible rules. 1/2 soup is chargeable extra. Onions and lemons are chargeable extra. Why are they even running a restaurant if they cannot afford onions...  Food - 3/5 Ambiance - 3/5 Service - 1/5 Value for money - 2/5"
4.0,This joint we were use to go to college days as well. Very pocket friendly and dhaba style food. Chicken bharta and lasuni chicken tikka is our faviurate order. Also tandoori masala chicken is too yumm. Interiors is rustic here and not very pleasing but who cares if we get awesome food. Whenever I'm in indiranagar I must drop in here for lunch/dinner. Recommended
3.5,"I found this place while I was looking for north indian food in indira nagar area. Visited this place with my family on a Saturday evening, it was crowded but we got a place within few minutes. The ambiance is okayish. We had few dishes here-  Chicken tandoori- It was roasted well but oily which was very evident on the plates. Chicken masala- Very disappointing, we were expecting it to be spicy but it had a tangy n creamy flavour Aloo mutter- This was little spicy but tasty Lassi- This was the showstopper in the dinner  Overall it was just a okay experience.   Food- 3/5 Ambiance- 3/5 Value for money- 3.5/5 Service- 3/5"
5.0,Love the butter chicken with butter naan. Been here several times..fish starter not recommended.. stick to chicken gravies.. never tried the rice items...Kheer is very tasty!
3.5,*Food is superb  *Service sucks Food is one reason that you cant stop yourself from going to this place but when it comes to service they really need to improve.
2.5,"The service was slow. The food served was cold. We informed the staff but the next two items were cold as well.   The Punjabi Paneer was really good. The Sheek Kebabs were dry. Decent portion sizes.  If the food had been served hot, we would have had a better experience overall.   The ambience is average but pleasant."
5.0,"Tasty and authentic North Indian cuisine. Though on a little bit costlier side, it was worth it. Took my family and everyone appreciated the taste including my mom-in-law."
3.5,"Just an above average restaurant serving north indian cuisine. Nothing great about their ambience as well. We ordered soya tikka masala, butter roti, babycorn crispy chicken punjabi and kheer. The best among these were baby corn and kheer. The babycorn was perfectly crispy and since kheer was served cold the flavour came out really well. Overall an average experience."
4.0,Visited this place today. Ambience is average over here. But Food compensated for it. Service was little slow. You can work on the lighting to attract more people.
4.0,"Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 3.5/5 Overall - 4/5  As the name of the place goes, it serves some awesome Punjabi food. I have been to this place several times, tried almost everything they have to offer, be it vegetarian or non vegetarian.   They have 2 seating sections on the first floor and on the second floor(which they open only when there are enough people),I personally prefer having food upstairs.   Coming to food their must haves will definitely be Butter Chicken, Dal Makhni, Rogan Josh, Bharta, Bhindi Masala, Punjabi Chicken and Pineapple Raita, make sure you order main course along with Pudina Parantha(how much I love them)only. The food is amazing, I have tried so many things and everything turned out to be good. I seriously doubt if you can get Punjabi food as good as this in the Indiranagar neighborhood. A certified place for Punjabi food, trust me a true Delhite and Punjabi speaking here  A must try for anyone craving for some authentic and amazing Punjabi food in Indiranagar. Thumbs up guys"
4.0,Really like the good. .for vegetarians peshawar paneer tikka is must... you get a perfect balance of spices in it...we also ordered chicken achari as a starter.. and for main course we had butter chicken with butter garlic naan. Believe me gravy was so so good that I only had gravy and left the pieces for my friend.good place to have casual dinner with ur loved ones and the best part is this place is not that expensive..I really liked the service and staff really friendly. Will definitely go again and again
3.5,"Only worth considering for a quick bite. Ordered Tandoori Gobhi which tasted more like a Gobhi bhujiya prepared by my cook. Thankfully the main course was face saver. Dal makhni, paneer tikka masala, veg kofta, jira-rice, chur-chur naan were above average. Service was quick but haphazard. We were almost served chicken that would have caused a lot of trouble to my hard core vegetarian friends. Cost wise pretty decent and pocket friendly. Interiors are done nicely adding to the punjab feel   Taste 3 Ambience 4 Price 4 Service 3"
4.5,"One of my favourite restaurants for Punjabi food. The place is not very fancy, very simple decor but the food is another level. Must try their Nargisi chicken, Its the best starter. Also their chicken chaat! For main course my favourite is butter chicken ofcourse, but I have tried almost all their main courses and each was equally good!"
4.5,"Amazing food, they always serve good food, the service was also good this time, a little bit more work ok the ambience can move this place to some new heights."
4.5,Have tried the vegetarian cuisines. Paneer gravies and veg seekh kabab were very good. Everyone who loves punjabi food must visit this place at least once.
4.0,"Specially the Paneer starter was awesome, worth hanging out with family and friends, superb taste for both veg and nonveg!! Prices slightly high but recommended!!"
4.5,I have been there for around 4-5 times and it's a good place to hang out with friends and family for lunch or dinner in Indira Nagar which have lots of variety both veg and non-veg. People from North side of India it is actually worth visiting this restaurant for lunch and dinner.
4.5,The food was awesome. The ambience is also good with good music. Enjoyed having nonvg main course. The staff is good and service is quick. Also got parking space for my bullet! When your tummy is happy everyone is happy lol
4.0,"I was in the town for 2 days when one of my friends told me about this place. Normal place with not much to show in terms of Ambience. We ordered Paneer butter masala, Daal makhani and naans. Daal Makhani was so good. I would visit this outlet again just for daal makhani alone. Service was great. Though the place was full that day and there was a little delay in service but the Manager was really sweet and treated us with a lot of respect. The prices are decent.  Small Tip: Jaljeera sucks! Order sweet lassi instead.  Ambience: 2/5 Service: 4.5/5 Food: 5/5"
3.5,"Tasty, authentic, buttery punjabi food. Dal makhani is delicious and so are stuffed parathas, chur chur naan (paneer stuffed naan) and the melt in mouth paneer butter masala. Kala khatta (masala thumbs up) and papad are the must tries. Ambience and service can be improved upon."
1.0,"Food was really pathetic, looks like majorly they concentrate on non vegetarian. Ambience is not good. No value for money. We tried sweet corn soup, that was the worst I ever had."
4.0,"Visited this place 8 months ago for the very first time and loved their lip smacking butter chicken. Got a take-away 3 days ago for Kadai chicken and Tandoori chicken, it was super good. Almost everything on the menu tastes authentic Punjabi. Must try sometime."
4.0,Love the butter chicken here. Tasty food and good quick service. Lassi was awesome. Nice place to go with friends or family. Would definitely visit again !!
4.5,Service 5 stars Food 4.5 stars  The food here is really amazing. Must try paneer starters for vegetarians it's authentic. The price paid for the food is worth every penny.Overall experience was splendid.Would suggest this place to everyone.
4.5,"Here u will get 'Propperr punjabbi' flavor!! We ordered basic food, punajbi paneer, naan and lassi which had a hint of rooh-afza.  Must try - Lassi  Ambiance: 9 Food: 9 Hospitality: 9"
1.0,"Pathetic customer service. Ridiculous behaviour by the staff. Ordered online and the staff wouldn't mind lying out of their mind to shut a call down. The delivery staff are equally obnoxious and it would really make a difference if they'd give two hoots about the people paying them for the food.   Extremely disappointing service. 3 calls to the restaurant resulted in the first telling me the order had left. The other telling me the order hasn't arrived. The third telling me it's on its way again.   Go figure, gents. You're running a circus out there."
4.5,"If you love north-indian food, you will find One of the best north-indian style food in Bangalore at The Punjabi Rasoi. Place is not that great. But Food is really delicious. We order-in from this place most of the time. Our absolute fav is ""Malamaal chicken"" - spicy side and ""chicken methi malai"" - little less spicy.  In starters, we just love the Nargasi chicken and afgani chicken. Most of the food we tried is excellent only, never felt disappointed with the food. A must try."
3.0,"Punjabi rasoi has been my regular choice for north indian food. Last saturday I went for lunch, We ordered mushroom takatak(too much oil), paneer lababdar which was lacking in that punjabi flavour and also rotis and naans were like rubber. Though, the lassi was good as always, our lunch was totally spoiled.  This was a really good place, hope that they improve soon."
4.0,Good food and delivery was as promised. Slightly over priced though. Pulao could have been better. Why does zomato force me to give long reviews!!!!!!!
2.5,"Not a real good experience.. We thought of ordering some Indian food from this place having known they serve one of the good Indian food around.. But was really disappointed with the delivery and most of the food. The paneer was really the poorest. We ordered kadahi paneer and it was really very sad. He rotis were almost uneatable, And on top of that some of he things were missing having checked after the delivery guy went... Only decent thing was butter chicken                                                                 akhilkohlifoodjourney.wordpress.com"
4.5,Awesome authentic Punjabi food. My all time favorite. Being a vegetarian I just love the food and the drinks here. No veg is also good (as my frnds hv liked it). Good in quantity and with apt price range.
5.0,"You just cannot miss this place if you are in Bangalore. I have simply loved this place, be it veg or non- veg. Staff is very courteous and the food is very wrll prepared and presented. Fast service   Please work a little on your ambience."
4.0,Punjabi Rasoi is a saviour for anyone esp. for those from North India living in Bangalore. Ordered a 3 course meal. The food quality is taste buds- blowing. It quenched the thirst of having good food. ambience and staff is also friendly. A must visit . Gets a thumbs up
4.5,Great place for food......yummy tasty food . Lots of options for non veggie... Ambiance needs improvement.... Busy place but still quick service.
4.0,"Visited this place today for lunch. It has been my all time favourite  place. I have been visiting  it's RT nagar branch since college days, and till today this place has never disappointed me Whether be veg or non vegetarian food. Today we went  to Indiranagar branch. We started with veg manchurian soup, For starters we ordered Achari Paneer, Mix veg manchurian chilli and tomato Chicken. We were almost full with the starters we ordered.The quantity  and the taste were decent. For main course we ordered  my all time favourite Amritsari stuffed Kulcha, dal tadka and sweet Lassi. Could not click the lassi as I was too busy relishing it. Its actually  heavenly, one must try if going  to this place. The service was a bit slow today because of the huge crowd for Friday noon lunch.  Total bill for three people: 1200"
4.0,"The food is amazing especially the quantity this is the most close you can come to the north Indian taste in bangalore. We ordered dal makhni , paneer maalamal and chicken malamaal we were 3 craving for north indian food and ate like we saw food for first time .   The food is really worth it and is in budget the lassi is must try . Order lachha parantha and butter naan you ill not be disappointed . The only thing is the place has no proper air conditioning -0.5 for that rest i am in love with this place. Buraaaaaahhhhh!!!"
3.5,Been here 4 times so very sure on writing this. 1st time this place was a delight the food was superb and fresh and service was prompt upto mark even when there was so much of a rush. Second and fourth time the food disappointed us like anything. If you go here there Dal tadka is a must try by far that has been the best thing i have had here. Go for punjabi kulcha rather than tandoori roti. Its a ok ok place but worth one shot. The beat part here is service.
5.0,Great food. I think best place to eat out in Bangalore with splendid interior and awesome music. Staff very very friendly and fast service.Enjoy with family/friends
4.0,"The Punjabi Rasoi definitely serve the best Punjabi food in town, although the taste differs a little in the different outlets. Their ambiance was good with elements from Punjab, a good entrance to the place and some Punjabi music playing in the background. A usually crowded place. Ordered Chicken Chaat in starters, it was a spicy taste enhancer. Continued with the Punjabi Chicken, jeera rice and tandoori rotis. The jeera rice was a bit under cooked. The Punjabi Chicken amazing as always. The prices are very average. Their service is warm and welcoming. They could probably work on the interiors a bit more. The HSR outlet surely still tops them all."
5.0,"Excellent food, amazing quality and decently priced.   Food  Specially non veg items like butter chicken, murg lababdar, mutton gravy, keema mattar etc are super tasty.  Ambience Terrace is the best place to sit . However it's super@ crowded during weekends."
2.5,"Decent North Indian food. The only thing that bothered me was their service. It was super slow. I can understand that the time when I went was a little early (07:30pm) , but the lassi was served when I had finished eating. I had clearly mentioned that I needed the lassi to be served together with the food, but I guess it was the staff was in no mood to hear that. Reminded twice about the lassi, and the only I reply I got was , ""Sir, it will come in two minutes""."
4.0,"I regularly visit this outlet. reasons being: 1) Food over here is awesome - Don't forget to order Dal tadka, Paneer punjabi, paneer tikka, Aloo bharwan 2)Quick service - Quick order & quick servce 3) Quality of food - Quality of food in terms of taste, look, flavor was good 4) Very professional management"
4.5,"For the past few months I was only going to cafe like places. I really wanted to have some Indian food and wat food can be good than Punjabi. Googled top ten punjabi restaurants in bangalore, came across this one located in Indiranagar. The place was simple not very attractive. We ordered chicken chat(which was mentioned as the restaurant's speciality) and gobhi tandoor. In my head I imagined it to be some kind of chat which turned out to be a better and spicier version of chicken tandoori and was lip smacking. I loved it. Gobhi tandoori was also good. Lassi seemed to be a bit overpriced here as they offer you a small glass of lassi which is again no different than lassi at other places which are cheaper."
1.0,"A very overrated, underachieving joint which should not be calling itself a Punjabi Restaurant at all.  Firstly, they come up with the wrong non-veg dish when we specified that we had come in only for a veg sitting.  Secondly, Rotis! A Punjabi joint's 'shaan' is to deliver one of the best specimens of Indian bread to go along with your 'zaaykedaar' curries. Unfortunately, neither the staff or the head of the staff know how to serve this delicacy. Cooked right before the curries were cooked, and all cramped in one basket so that the steam just makes them all mildewy and rubbery.  On top of all of this, the waiter tries to argue this is how it is done in The Real Punjab, and that we had no idea because we weren't from there.  The quality of the vegetables that were delivered was very very bad. You could smell the rotting capsicum from the Veg Kadai, and the excuse for this was that it was over-cooked. A Veg Kofta was brought in its stead, but the Kofta was just cooked in Chicken gravy, and we know this because we had bones comes out of this.  Maybe this was a one-off bad experience for me, and maybe it's not that all bad, but you only get one chance to make a good first experience, and this was a catastrophe. Never going to be recommending this joint to anyone, and also would go out of my way to stop my friends and strangers from going to this place either."
2.5,"Overrated, oily, spicy, disastrous service and everything else. I have no good reason to rate them good. Overuse of oil to make the the food taste great but they have left the health quoeint of healthy punjabi food miles behind. ""FREQUENT INTAKE OF THIS FOOD CAN MAKE YOU FALL SICK AND REAL SICK"". Please refer the images attached. Still the mint chutney, makki ki roti and lassi which was prepared with kewda flavoured water were few good things to remember. Service was a tragedy, I saw most of the stewards gathered at a place and most of them looked confused. We were not provided with the welcome salad, water jar was not clean with leafs and dust in it and location was not safe with lots of hawkers, drunkards and local rowdies making the place feel unsafe for ladies and definitely parki is another issue. The Punjabi Rasoi"
3.0,Had been to this place after hearing a lot of good stuff Was really disappointed  The soup was good  But someone please tell them that in india if chicken is not well done it isnt acceptable to the crowd or pleasing specially if it is an Indian dish  Medium and rare just not acceptable.
4.5,"The only place in bangalore which have best Paneer dishes. Veggie ppl can understand the importance of Paneer. :) You should also try their lassi, I found it really good. Other curries are also good."
3.5,"I went here on a Sunday afternoon with  a group of friends for lunch.  Food : I had ordered Naan and paneer.  It was just average for me, nothing too fancy. However the lassi  was great!  Ambience  : it gets crowded during weekends  Budget : I feel it was not  worth it, as I have had better at a lesser rate."
4.5,"Has to be one of the best Punjabi food I had in recent times. We took the suggestions of our steward and went for Peshawari Paneer Tikka, Soya Tikka, Butter Rotis with Nagada Paneer. Paneer was so soft and special mention to their yummy chutney. For someone who doesn't like Soya, Soya Tikka was a pleasant change. Nagada Paneer which tastes a bit like malai kofta was superb. And Lassi with rose flavour added will fill your tummy to the fullest. Even their saunf is one of the best I have had :-D  Special mention to out steward who kept checking on us regularly, suggesting us to have more chutney, refilling it, taking our feedback on each dish. Probably one of the best service I have received. And the price is definitely on the lower side considering the locale they operate in. Will definitely head back there again."
1.5,All dishes had too much oil in it. It was looking so weird that we could not finish our meal properly. Though service was on time but food quality sucked .
3.0,"Went here for a Sunday lunch. Place was crowded, may be because of weekend. Service and ambience were good. I felt food was over oily. Chicken was cooked well, both in starter and main course. Lassi was not as per expectation Prices are appropriate considering the quality and quantity."
3.0,"When i 1st heard about this place. too much hype was already created. i thought let me hit there to see what's so special.  when we went there, it was a Saturday, almost 15-20 folks were waiting out.anxiety increased.  at leastafter half hour, we got seated, order chicken sheek, lassi, naan and chicken Punjabi... Trust me, nothing was woww about these dishes.. it doesnt mean it was tasting bad.. its just that, the taste was just normal/good.. nothing more than that.. thats the 1st and last time i went there..  when ever i feel like having punjabi, i'd prefer those small dhabasrather than these places."
4.0,The food of this place never goes below your expectations...have tried theri many dishes and each one was up to the mark...on of my favourite place to order from. Paneer lababdar is my favourite. The kebabs are tasty and daal tadka is simply awesome.  Also their terrace sitting is good enough for chilly days !! Ambience of first floor is not that great.
1.0,"Ordered the following: Keema Mutter, Dal Tadka, Bhindi Do Pyaaza and Some Rotis.  Overall: Try if you are being frisky, you won't go back again. Service: Quotient doesnt exist. After placing the order, I called them up to request for the food to be prepared with less oil. The gentleman who answered was not only rude to the point of sounding arrogant but also inconsiderate to what I was asking for politely. A simple requirement but clearly a tall feat for them. Food Taste & Quality: If you are in a mood to eat two meals by ordering only once, these are the guys. Not because the food was delectable but rather you are likely to be put off so bad that you might want to skip the next meal entirely. Extremely salty and layered with extra oil, none of the dishes did justice to the North Indian tag. Verdict: This Rasoi is not cooking."
4.0,Awesome restaurant and nice ambience. The food quality is typically punjabi style and taste great. The one I liked most was Chicken Chaat in starter and Sweet Lassi. The Service is a bit slow though. The starters were coming one by one.
1.0,"Very very bad service, I did online order and even after getting acknowledgement msg.. They did not knew that there is a online order was placed. After calling them it turned out they don't have most of the items..Again they confirmed that order is placed by changing some items..but it was never delivered to us..This way customers can never be happy.. Extremely bad service..I am not going to recommend in future.."
5.0,I ordered online and specifically asked for less oil and less spices on the rajma and it was just perfect. I'm confident if you order online and ask them for specific instructions they will deliver on it. Thanks!
4.0,"One of my another recommended places to hang out at, in case you want to have decent punjabi meal , at affordable price. they have two seatings, One at the first floor, the inner dining is a bit suffocated one! but the terrace one is pretty nice decorated with plants , gives fresh breeze. Coming to the food, this is one restaurant whose green chutney is finger licking! From the starters Paneer Shashlik would be a good try for veggies as it has Tandoori paneer as well as Pieces of tandoored Pineapple. Naan's and kulchas are also good! they also have a paan wala to eat paan in the end! But yes , I would suggest them to have a more friendly staff and may be increase the head count so that service is made faster."
4.5,"Good place for Authentic Punjabi food. Methi Malai Chicken is my fav. There is 1 dish which I have not seen in other Punjabi place is Chicken Chaat, it is just so tasty. A treat for your tastebuds"
4.5,The best Punjabi food that you can have in Bangalore at the most affordable price... Please consider this remark only for the branch in Indira Nagar as others are not so good...  I found the owners also quite welcoming and happy souls with smiling face all the time - this reflects in the service staff as well...   I never miss out eating at this place whenever we are out in that area.
4.5,good restaurant. paneer malamal is amazing. Lipsmacking chicken chat. Love this place. Still sceptic on trying other items. Chicken lababdar was also tasty.
2.0,"Great Food; Rude and Dumbass guy at the counter. Somehow, these guys seem to have taken customer experience for granted.  Would deliver; not go back again."
4.0,"Very authentic Punjabi food. I tried amritsari fish, nargisi chicken, mutton rogan josh and mutton keema. Food was little expensive but tasty. If you want to have good north indian food this is a good place to try."
3.5,"Me with my hubby went there on weekend night.Little crowded so sent us on roof sitting..that is much better to ground one.We have ordered kadhai mashroom,afgani chicken,chicken biriyani and tandoori.Food was ok but little spicy.Service was good."
4.0,"Need to appreciate taste, good quality and manoeuvre. Cottage cheese are numb arousing your taste buds specially paneer achari with some delicious lassi.  Missing on the plate is service, which is good but dilatory."
3.0,Good food nothing extraordinary but... Place needs renovation. Friendly staff Quick service Need to work on the cleanness part as they keep used plates and glasses on a counter table which is very near to your table for quite some time.  I liked Masala pampad Achari chicken didn't like much bt my friend liked. Had butter nan which was good. Amritsari kulcha which was tasty. Chicken rogan josh was tasty but very oily. Butter milk was extremely bad. The consistency was very thin....  Good experience....
3.0,"A decent North Indian restaurant. It served good tandoori, indoor as well as rooftop sitting is available. Good to go if you do not want to cook and eat something tasty.                                                                 keepitstylishdayita.com"
4.0,Very authentic Punjabi food and decor of this place. I tried Chicken Malai Tikka & Chicken Patiyala  both were above average in taste. The mint chutney served along with food is yummy.   They do good business as there are not many restaurants nearby with this quality of food.   Location is little awkward and congested.
2.5,The place is very shady and it seriously need some renovation. The food remind me of the north india but not typical pujabi food. They server more curry then pieces of chicken or paneer.
4.5,"All of my friends had visited Punjabi Rasoi, only me had not till now, they used to tell me about the tasty food, the dal makhani and rotis. Decided to go along with one of my friends on sunday and had a great experience."
4.0,"Had ordered my dinner from this place yesterday night. Didn't order much, as it was already late in the night. We ordered (For two):  Kadai Veg - Rs. 185/- Plain Phulkas (4 nos.) - Rs. 60/- (Rs. 15/- each) Tandoori Roti (1 no.) - Rs. 20/-  It costed us Rs. 300/- (inclusive of tax and the rest) - which is a completely reasonable. The quantity of the curry - the size of the roti and phulkas, was good. The phulkas and roti, were properly cooked and remained soft - both to break and to eat. The taste of the curry was good - the vegetables were properly smeared with the spices. The only thing which left me wondering when I opened the container lid was - the amount of oil in the curry. I literally had to pour off the oil prior to eating it. Besides that, everything else was perfect. Would love to order again, pretty soon! A great North Indian food joint in the neighborhood :)"
4.0,This place has a good variety for veg and nonveg  Paneer tikka and chicken makhni was good.  Garlic naan added an extra bit to the lunch  Food quality is great  Pricing is good  Ambience is good
4.0,"The Punjabi Raosi. Our life saver for more then 3 years when we were in Bangalore. Let it be bulk orders for food on office or a weekend get together, the number for Punjabi Rasoi was always on speed dial ;) My fav was amritsari kulcha, Daal Makhni and chicken 2 pyaza. Simply mouthwatering delicious. The order can take upto 2 hours in buzy hours from 8 to 10 pm ,but, its always worth the wait. I wish they open there outlets in other cities too."
1.5,"Maybe this place is much more favourable to non-vegetarians. However, our experience with veg dishes jas been mixed. The last time we visited, I made a mistake of ordering Shahi Paneer. Out came a soup like gravy full of butter, along with just three small pakodas of paneer floating in it. I wish I had taken a picture. Not worth the Money they charge, atleast for vegetarians. Used to be a regular, may Not visit again."
3.5,"It used to provide great food and was a boon for us north indians in Bengaluru. But with money mindedness of their management on an all time high, they now provide highly overpriced, extremely oily, average food (in terms of quantity)."
3.5,"The place looks promising. The location is quite convenient and people throng the restaurant during the weekend. It is located on two floors. We chose to sit on the top floor which is better ventilated compared to the floor below. The staff is courteous but do not go out of the way to make the experience extraordinary. They got our food out with dispatch and even took pictures when requested.  The food on the other hand was ordinary. The only thing that stood out was the amount of ghee/oil that it was soaked in. If they think punjabi food is full of grease and it cannot be made succulent without it, thats a misconception. I really want to give this restaurant a good rating but the food quality is holding me back. I really wish they would improve upon it."
1.0,One of the worst and overrated places I've ever been to. To be very honest I got suggestions from one of my friends to visit this place for a change of taste buds. The food I ordered was chicken rogan josh and Punjabi rasoi special chicken some naans and rice. The gravy's were overly salty when I asked them to replace it he did do it but to my disdain then reduced the salt and added a lot of chilly powder. The one star I gave was because of the waiters who were very polite. So all in all worst restaurant I've ever been to.
3.5,Good for dinner ... The best food I had was chicken tikka masala and pulka .. Other then that I would taste that much tastier but the friends who came with me had some other recipes they told it was good ... Any way I like oly those I mentioned ..  Have a best pulka and chicken tikka  masala
5.0,"'Buttery rich goodness' - is what you get at Punjabi Rasoi. Delicious meals that I've often ordered to office for lunch. Heavy as it may be, but still worth the fight against sleep post lunch :). My favourites - afghani chicken, black dal and of course, the butter naan. Huge quantities though, so ensure you have company for lunch!"
4.5,Been here twice with my friends. Your taste buds will encounter with one of the best non-veg dishes. One of my favorite place for non-veg and recommend the same for all non veg lovers.  Ambiance is also very good.. decent spaced roof top but very well decorated.  Food      : 4.5/5 Ambiance : 4/5 Cost       : 4.5/5
2.5,I didn't like the place at all. There's nothing special in ambience. The food was bad. The sweet corn soup we ordered had too much salt in it. The gobi starter was very salty and too spicy. Buttermilk was very thin. No much options  in desserts.
3.5,We were looking for a decent and a budget place to have dinner. We came across The Punjabi Rasoi in Zomato. The place is good for the price taht they charge. We had chicken lababdar and roti/naan. Maybe one dish is far too less to judge a place on. Will try other items on teh menu definitely some other time.
3.5,"One of the few places that live up to its name of serving decent quality punjabi food at reasonable prices. Good ambience. Ordered Afghani chicken, mix veg, dal tadka and naan. Large portions served. Only issue was that the food had more oil that I prefer. Also, I would recommend booking a table before going specially on weekends or holidays."
5.0,Brilliant succulent food cooked to pure perfection. It's a must for anyone who has a penchant for Indian flavours and the feeling of satisfaction that comes with a hearty meal.
4.5,Went with lot of exceptions to this place and it din't disappoint us. the ambiance and service was good . For starters we ordered soup and chicken chat which was yummy. In main course we ordered veg( Paneer Malamal) which was really rich in taste and flavor. Overall good experience and a must try place to go with family.
4.5,"Great place for Punjabi food. Ambience, service is good. Try missi roti it's really good. Chicken dishes are also very good and tasty........"
4.0,Went there last Sunday evening. The place is a bit hard to find. And the ambience is ok-ok . There was a queue and we had to wait for 10 minutes. Well coming to the quality of food : That was really good and we loved it. We had went to this place on the suggestion of a friend as we wanted to have punjabi food and we thanked the guy who suggested. Overall I would say it is a good place if you are a foodie like me but if you are expecting a great ambience then you can be a bit disheartened.
4.0,"Every time I have a craving for good north Indian food, I turn to this place for a wonderful meal. The service is fast and the setting is quite informal. The food is delicious and a little spicy (quite expected from a Punjabi restaurant)"
2.0,"I got to know about The Punjabi Rasoi through my relatives, who order in regularly from here. They love the food but have always complained that the food takes longer than usual to get delivered - even when it's a small, uncomplicated order. This was the third time I ordered in, and while the food was a bit cold and greasier than usual, I would have let that go if it would have been delivered on time. I received the order exactly two hours after placing it, with an incorrect bill. Not sure if it is an issue with the restaurant or Zomato, but whatever it is, it needs to be fixed."
4.5,If you are looking for a place with ample quantity at a decent price then Punjabi Rasoi is the stop you must make. Brilliant Punjabi food. Their Dal Makhani and Lacha Paratha is finger licking good. Please do go here if you are in Indiranagar. :)
3.5,"Good Punjabi food, decent price  Ambience not so great  Have to wait for sometime to get in Service not so good  Overall an average restaurant"
3.5,"Wonderful place for Punjabi non veg lovers. Most of the main course have perfect blend of spices in gravy section.  Must try is Chicken Rada. Service is decent and parking space issue for cars. Try the lemon soda, its good too!"
1.0,"Been there today for lunch with friends.Very bad service, staff was very rude, no etiquettes. Food was total disaster.  Being a north indian I took my south indian friends to this restro , it let me down."
5.0,Whatever you eat or drink here is just simply awesome... I usually do not go past the starters because whatever they have under the starter section is just simply unbeatable.. Prices are reasonable too  Must try Chicken Achari Lasooni Chicken kebab  And dont forget the Lassi
4.0,Awesome place to hangout and have lunch or dinner. we went in a group of 7 people and have found really nice place on top with a feeling of open roof top though it was not open completely. Food is awesome and service is also good. Quick service and place is with lots of greenery on top floor. surely will recommend to go and have awesome punjabi/ north indian food.
4.5,Tasty North Indian food with perfect taste .Chicken Chat is very good and with different taste .Good ambience and friendly staff . Have been there twice and satisfied both the times with their service.
3.0,The place is not easy to locate...you have to keep looking for a board and on the 3rd floor..average ambience..good service..for starter we ordered veg sheekh kabab which was delicious...sarson ka saag was very good with makai roti...below standards dal makini average paneer lababdar and tawa murg..better north Indian restaurants in bangalore
2.0,"Had been today at this place with my office colleagues, as we dine out for lunch on every working Saturdays. Food has been awesome specially afgani chicken. Though we ordered few more appetizers, but most of them were not available even though it is mentioned in menu. Staff are not aware about dish availability, and they just note the order. But after waiting for almost 10 minutes, they inform such dish is not available. So whole waiting period gone waste. Though food is awesome, but poor knowledge of staff and bad service quality has lead us not to visit next time. No serving of water regularly. Not  attending the table regularly by waiters, requires you lot of effort to call waiters. Even if food is good, but if your service quality is not upto the mark, then no customer will visit you again.   Overall, not recommended."
4.5,"The best north indian eatery in Bangalore. The Sarson Da Saag and Paneer Do Pyaaza are too die for. My favourite go to place whenever I crave north indian food. For the main course, we had butter nan, Kadai paneer and dal tadka. The paneer item is a must try over here. It's really soft and tasty. Had some lassi and buttermilk in the end. # Service - The order was brought about in decent time."
5.0,Enjoyed a really good meal here north indian style. The Hot & Sour Veg soup was absolutely amazing also very good was the Dal Makhani with the Biryani. Overall a good place to go in for a hearty meal.
4.0,"If you have love for North Indian style non vegetarian food make sure you do visit this place. The food here is awesome. In terms of quantity and quality I would give it 5/5. Make sure you do try their Kandhari tikka, it's just awesome. Don't forget to end your food with a glass of lassi. It was a little difficult locating this place as it is quite inside, but it was totally worth it."
4.5,Have been a regular here for ages now. The Lahori daal is awesome. So is Hyderabadi Paneer and Amritsari Kulche. Ghee rice puts you on a guilt trip and an immediate crash diet! And it's totally worth it. The staff is cordial and well looked after.  One of the best places to have a tasty and authentic punjabi Khana
4.5,"This place offers a true North Indian food. Most dishes that I have tried at this place are good. Their paneer dishes are a must try. This is one of the very few places in Bangalore that serve very soft and nice paneer. Try their chutney for sure your taste buds would love it. On top of everything, they have North Indian style pickle on every table that something I do not find in most North Indian restaurants in Bangalore. So, in nutshell, a must visit restaurant if you are looking for something in Indiranagar."
3.0,"The Punjabi Rasoi, always attracts a swarm of people ! It is probably the best Punjabi restaurant in that area, but not the best :) Frankly speaking have visited many better Punjabi food joints in and around Bangalore :) Talking about food, we had ordered the authentic Punjabi food - Makke de roti and sarson da saag. Makke de roti was good but the sarson da saag was not up to the mark :( The ambience of the place is not that great, just that the ceiling is decked up with a number of kites ! The service is quite fast :) in my opinion, not a great place if u want to have some authentic Punjabi food !"
2.5,The veg food was not that great. We ordered starters like Gobi fry which was very salty nd babycorn fry. As the main course we ordered mushroom masala nd Hyderabadi paneer both had extream oil in it and it wasnt served hot. The lassi that we ordered with starter came only after the main course came. The service was quiet disappointing maybe due to Friday night. The ambience was very nice with kites on the ceiling nd dim lights. Over all the food was below average.
4.0,"This was our weekend adda while staying in indra nagar. It has nice punjabi ambiance with kites on ceiling. I have tried both veg n non veg here, but non veg is super awesome. Esp the afghani chicken is the best. This is the best budgeted restaurant for good food. A pan at the exit is the add on."
3.5,The Punjabi rasoi in HSR is much better. The tikkas werent soft and could have been better in taste. Butter chicken tasted nothing like one in HSR and was average.
4.0,"The food was really amazing. We ordered aloo parantha,lachaparatha, dal makhani and Punjabilassi. Usually, dal makhanielsewhere is very watery but I liked the buttery dal makhni,it was mouth watering. The service was good and the ambience was peaceful. A good place for lunch."
3.5,"We went on nearbuy offer for a 4 course meal. The paneer was amazing. The chicken gravy, kulcha , lassi , dal fry and zeera rice that we got was all amazing. A really good place if you want to eat north Indian tasty food. The ambiance is okay located very near to 100 ft road."
4.5,"The finest Punjabi food in Bangalore. Was recommended by a friend, but didn't expect this place to be so good. The ambiance is simple with 2 levels for dining. They serve standard Punjabi food such as breads, rice and gravies, but the taste is simply awesome. We tried the Chicken malamal with laccha paratha's and kulchas. The gravy was finger licking. Mushroom fried rice was tasty. Recommend for a good stomach full punjabi meal."
4.0,"Ordered chicken achaari , Punjabi panneer , Gobi tandoori and Aloo paratha. I'm a pakka non-vegetarian. Won't touch veg items kind. I liked Punjabi panneer to the core.  Chicken was also superb. I would recommend this place to not only north Indians but to all food lovers."
4.0,"The place is a must visit if you like north Indian cuisine. Achari chicken and achari paneer are delicious here. Also, dal makhani is worth a try.The home made aam ka acchar served along with meal is really yum. I go their often when I want to enjoy tasty north Indian food. Ambiance is not that great. One tip: if you planning to go on any sat/Sunday evening,plan ur visit a li'l early as the place is usually very crowded at that time."
2.5,Overall experience at the restaurant was not that good. The ambience was a 3 upon 5 . Don't go with the names of the food directly better to enquire about the recipe before ordering. There was not a much variety to order in veg. The waiter himself was unaware of the dishes and their availability.
1.0,"There was a band aid with blood was delivered to us along with the food, we never knew that Punjabi Rasoi gives such kind of stuff as a complementary gift..."
3.5,"Another restaurant in indiranagar which serves authentic Punjabi cuisine. Came here to have lunch with my friend as we had not tried this place.  Ordered kadai mix veg, rotis and kulchas and lassi. The lassi was just standard coming to a place which serves Punjabi food where you expect it to be Punjabi-like. The subji was good but a tad too oily. I have to mention about the pickle. It was tangy and used it as a relish with roti and subji.  All in all a decent place with good food.  Budget for two - 700 Rs"
4.0,"We went last week for a lunch outing. The ambience and food quality was good, ambience was nice. Service was rather average out, Nice try out place."
3.0,"Ordered for a hara bhara kabab, Aaloo paratha and Gulab jamun. Really loved their Aaloo paratha. Kababs were a little spicy. Gulab jamun was good but it wasn't properly cooked."
3.0,"Two storey building with a rooftop option as well. The ambience was good. The staff was friendly. Having very less options for vegetarian food, tried the paneer shashlik, butter roti with Punjabi paneer curry and lime soda. The taste was average. However my friends who tried the non-veg food said it was really good. The price was a bit on the higher side."
4.0,Amazing punjabi food..being a delhite it's verry difficult to find a good punjabi food in Bangalore.But Punjabi rasoi has the authentic taste. Ambience is not that great but who cares if the food taste is  brilliant.
4.5,"The perfect Punjabi food. I had the best Paneer Paratha here. I was impressed by ambience. Food was so yummy. I had veg, but I came to know form other friends non veg was equally good. Worth money and taste. If you are addicted to Punjabi food, this is a must visit place."
4.5,"Decided, we head to this restaurant near the bda complex, indiranagar. Surprisingly, the place was full and we had to wait for the table. The ambience isn't great. The roof is pasted with full of kites, but it's the food which brings people to this restaurant. Doesn't give the dhaba feel as well. One of the good things about this place is that it serves good food and at the same time is quite reasonably priced. An option to reckon always when North Indian cuisine is on the Hogg list."
3.5,"Small, pretty reasonable place. Service is just wonderful. The Hot & Sour Veg soup was delicious! The Afghan chicken starter was creamy and well-done; but very heavy. The Nagada Paneer was excellent. The Bhindi Masala, Dal Makhni, and Veg Biryani were all good, but had a little extra salt. Overall, definitely worth it."
4.5,One of the cheap and best restaurants you find in her layouts Always crowed when ever I go there. But the service fast with respect to the crowd what they have.  In main course we have had butter chicken and mutton roganjosh which are quite tasty as per their reputation. We tried biriyani once which you may avoid though. But the butter kulchas are best with any gravy items. I preferably go for butter naan but here in Punjabi Rasoi I have loved the butter kulchas more than butter nan.
3.5,Foood is great so as ambiance.seating arrangement is good in covered roof top..though they will say they are serving buffet but actually they arr not.if u will ask for buffet they will say yes and serve two varities of main course dishes and for desserts u have to ask again n again so better avoid buffet.
5.0,The best north indian eatery in Bangalore. The Sarson Da Saag and Paneer Do Pyaaza are too die for. My favourite go to place whenever I crave north indian food. These guys should have a 5/5 rating. The 3.8 is a disgrace.
4.5,"My mom and Dad were in town and were bored of south Indian food. They wanted some authentic north Indian, and also wanted to go to a new place. We zeroed down this place.  The ambience is okay, can be worked upon. The kites on roof and steel plates is not enough to give it the rustic, raw...Punjab look.   That being said, you can not undermine them as they have really invested there time and energy in something that is more important, food and the staff that delivers it.   The staff understands not only English, but also HINDI LANGUAGE and is fluent in it. They are going to help you choose your food if you're lost and also are going to take good care of you till the time you dine.  We started with **MANCHOW SOUP**(3.5/5) cause dad wanted some spices in his system. It was just about average, No major flaw, but was not great either. I started doubting my selection for the night."
4.0,"First I was not sure to go this place as Rating was 3.8 but I wanted to try a different restaurant in North Indian Cuisine so I went there ... This restaurant is more than Okay taste is Awesome. Recommended: Nargisi Tikka, Chicken Chat, Butter Chicken. Cleanliness is something they can work upon. I have seen ants scattered on couple of tables. Nice food allover. You can have delicious food as well."
3.5,"Nice punjabi khana. Not much to talk about the ambience or anything but the food is well cooked, relatively easy on the pocket, good service as well."
4.0,"A good decent place for punjabi food. I have been here several times. In last visit, I ordered Afghani Chicken which was mouth watering. Next came Kadhai Paneer which was spicy. Finally, It's a good place for lunch or dinner.  Don't forget to try mouth freshener. It's awesome."
4.5,"We really loved the food - after a long search we finally got a real good authentic Punjabi food place. Price and quantity was very reasonable. We ordered Amritsari Kulcha, Amritsari Fish, Butter chicken, Chicken Punjabi and Methi Parathas - all the dishes were awsome . We will keep coming here for Punjabi food . Amritsari Kulcha and Butter chicken were the best I have eaten anywhere in Bangalore . Behavior of the staff also very nice . Thank you Punjabi Rasoi !"
4.0,"Went for lunch. # Place and ambience - There is an indoor seating available on the first floor and outdoor seating on the next floor. Both were good. A simple setting. # Food - We had a baby corn starter. For the main course, we had butter nan, Kadai paneer and dal tadka.The paneer item is a must try over here. It's really soft and tasty. Had some lassi and buttermilk in the end. # Service - The order was brought about in decent time. They served the food on our plates only when we asked, this could be an aspect which can be improved."
3.0,U can find many kind of dishes and it normally ok. The chicken is normally either hard or not fully cooked that i could see the blood Basically still was ok
4.0,Great food. Average ambience. Service seems to be a bit slow when you arrive at a peak hour on weekends. They have a lot of options for both greens and the reds. Although the dessert list is a bit short and simple. Do visit for the food and terrace sitting!
5.0,Ordered Punjabi chicken and tandoori roti. It was amazing. Authentic Punjabi food for sure. Will definitely come back here for sure. The service was very fast and even on a day like Sunday we managed to get seats pretty easily. The ambience of the place was good. Loved the music in the place too.
4.5,"Nice ambience and non-veg is very tasty. Tandoori chicken, nargisi chicken was very good. Mutton Fried rice with kheema mutter was heavenly. Good tasty preparation. Service was bit delayed but otherwise nice experience. I think in Indiranagar one of the best place considering price and quality. Must go!!!"
4.5,"If you like Punjabi food, this is the place to be at. Paneer pasanda and dal makhani I would recommend.  Ambience : 4/5 Food : 4/5 Service : 4/5"
3.5,The chana masala and roti was very yy yyyyy delicious and the punjab da lassie was also aammmaaziiiinngggg... but the jal jeera and aam ka paana was not up to the mark...can make these two drinks more delicious..
4.5,Went to Punjabi Rasoi two weeks back  My Rating :  Food: (4/5)  Service: (3/5)  Ambiance: (4/5)  Value for money:(4/5)
4.5,"One of the best place for authentic Punjabi food located in Indiranagar. We ordered food and it was served very soon as it was heading closing of kitchen . Taste is outstanding and service is quick. We tried chicken chaat , Afghani chicken ,paneer malamaal along with amritsari kulcha and methi Paratha.Chicken chaat is well marinated and delicious dish , a must try for all.Rates are reasonable and ambiance is ok .We were quite satisfied and will definitely again to explore the menu"
4.0,Really liked this place. Decent enough for a family visit as well. Absolutely loved the food here. They have a terrace seating area as well. The staff are really quick and friendly. I'm definitely visiting again!
3.5,Ambience is ordinary. It is my favourite restaurant to have chicken tandoori and chicken punjabi with butter kulcha. We used to visit every Friday for lunch when my office was at Indira nagar .
2.0,"As this place was tried by one of our colleagues earlier, went there for lunch. Had to change the corner table as there were cockroaches on the side wall. The ambiance anyways is ordinary. Started with cream of mushroom soup, that was quite ok. This we followed with Veg and Non Veg starter platters. Except for tandoori chicken , the rest of the meat on the non veg platter was stale. Even the veg platter was quite ordinary and full of onions and capsicum which no one consumed. In the main course we ordered for Malai kofta and Chicken Lababdaar along with Naan and rotis. The breads and the kofta were nice, although kofta was a little too sweet for my taste. Chicken Lababdaar was not at all like the one that I had in their RT Nagar outlet. Looks like whatever chicken gravy you order out of the 40 odd listed ones, they give you one of the two or three that they prepare and keep in stock. Again the chicken in the gravy was chewy and stale. Being a punjabi, felt like giving it a ""1"" rating but I guess the malai kofta was the saving grace. Not recommended for non vegetarians."
3.5,"It was a sunday evening, a huge group of 12 people decided to try this venue for some real good food for dinner. After a long wait we finally could find a place in the rooftop. Witout much delay we ordered tandoori chicken, afghani chicken, lassi and sweet salt lime soda. The tandoori chicken was soft, tender and succulent but the afghani chicken wasnt that great. The lassi was really good and it could almost fill up your tummy. Next for the main course we ordered naan, lababdar chicken, chicken punjabi, chicken bharta, alu gobi, dal tadka, and steam rice. All the dishes were really good but chicken bharta was the best to taste. Each item was delicious and had a rich texture. Its quite reasonable and with a huge crowd you can surely keep this place in your list where you can enjoy some good food."
4.5,At last here my dinner ends up with the Punjabi food! Waah man ko chahh ditta! Sasoo ta saag and makke Di roti.. Butter naan chicken tandoori... Waah bhai waah!! Ambiance is super cool...it gives the vibe of punjab! I even love the pan corner which is infront of the door! All along it is amazing!  In main course we have had butter chicken and mutton roganjosh which are quite tasty as per their reputation. We tried biriyani once which you may avoid though. But the butter kulchas are best with any gravy items. I preferably go for butter naan but here in Punjabi Rasoi I have loved the butter kulchas more than butter nan.  Cost is reasonable considering the quality and quantity of food.
4.5,I love this place ! Cozzz it has the true punjabi taste in its food  !!! Doesnt make me miss the true taste  of punjab ! Everything hea is tooo awesome to eat !  Truly blissssful
3.5,"Having heard some great reviews about their food, I ended up here today for lunch.  I was quite famished and I browsed through their menu and was happy to see many many options. From paneer pasanda to chicken tikka masala to tawa mushrooms and even to some Chinese items like fried rice, are a part of their menu. Loved the spread! The ambience is pretty normal, the entire roof is decked up shiny big kites and they play nice Bollywood music, normal chair seating arrangements over a large area. Good set up for a families to enjoy their meals mostly.  We ordered a lassi, tandoori chicken, garlic naans and paneer Hyderabadi. I liked the consistency of the lassi, nice hint of rose syrup in it. Quite good!  The tandoori chicken was oily and hard. The marination was only on the outside and the insides of the chicken was quite hard with almost no taste in it. Could be better!  Next came the garlic naans which had generous amount of butter in them. The portions were decent as well. The Hyderabadi paneer was tasty, with soft pieces of paneer cooked in a spicy masala. Quite different from the usual choices!  The bill was roughly around 660 all inclusive which is decent for the portions served.  The service is slow, food takes long to arrive and the staff is always frowning. Don't quite appreciate that, so that can be worked upon.  Loved the mouth freshener served though!  Decent place for satisfying punjabi cravings without a pocket pinch."
4.0,"Have been a fan of this place since the beginning..located in Indiranagar, the place is easily accessible.. well maintained and even with full house the place doesn't look congested. Very often people can be seen waiting for their turn outside the restaurant and that tells you how good the food is.. punjabi rasoi's dal makhni is my all time favourite.. food is really authentic and the staff is also very professional.. if you like punjabi food you should definitely visit this place.. they have home delivery options too and total 3 branches in Bangalore.."
4.0,"A good decent place to have spicy Punjabi food but not as better as its other branch in RT Nagar. Must try: Paneer Achaari, Peshawari Peneer tikka, Punjabi Paneer Gravy and Lassi. Ambiance: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Value for money: 4/5 Staff: 4/5"
3.0,"Had a quick meal here with 4 other friends before boarding the bus to Mangalore.  Nothing fancy about the ambience.Regular seating.  We ordered lassi, Manchow soup, Phulka, Dal and Mushroom masala.I expected plain lassi but it was flavored with rose which i hated.Perhaps they should inform before.  My friends liked the soup. Phulka's served was hot, tasted fine but can be more thick, they were so thin that i finished it in 2-3 bites.Dal tadka was made  to perfection.The Mushroom masala was decent.  Service is quick and attentive.Do try the mouth fresher they serve at the end of the meal.We paid Rs.820, felt a little on the higher side."
5.0,Chicken Chat & Afghani Fish i am in love with you. How can you be so perfect and amazing. Way to go.. keep it up Punjabi Rasoi.
1.0,"This place turned out to be a nightmare out of no-where. Service was pathetic, right from the start. Main course arrived before starters. Waiter did not know whether dish was spicy or not and kept on insisting that white gravy dish was spicy. And served 2 white gravy dishes. We finally managed to convince him to replace one of them. But damage was already done and mood was ruined. Final nail in the coffin was biryani which tasted like a simple fried rice. Giving one star because can not give lower than that."
4.5,Ordered shai paneer and loved it. Never ate such a paneer ever before. Chicken chilly was great. It's worth spending money on such a good place. It's little expensive but worth it. Great ambiance. Great food. Great service.
2.5,"Food: one of the best punjabi food I find in Bangalore. Paneer lababdar and Dal makhani always hit the mark. Though I am vegetarian, the reviews my friends give for chicken Afghani are also pretty good. Service: now here comes the downside. They have really average service. The owner is rude to customers, and doesn't care whether you visit next time or not. On a busy day, they will try to hasten your whole meal. They won't even listen to any complaints you might have about food. I would have given 4 star if was judging only on basis of food."
1.0,"On other days, I would have rated this restaurant (Indiranagar) a 10/10 but not today. Have been a regular customer since I shifted to Bangalore, but when my ""vegetarian"" wife fished out a bone (size of a pinky finger) from her portion of their famous Daal Makhani, I was baffled and equally angry at my decision of choosing this very restaurant tonight. The bone has been chewed from one end (whether it was human or rat.. your guess is as good as mine or maybe this is a secret ingredient). Since it was a takeaway, I immediately called up the restaurant and was offered a free daal makhani after few word exchanges. No sir, please keep the free dal makhani with you, I from now onwards will be happy with home-made tindas, bhindis etc."
4.0,This place is a treat to Punjabi food lovers! They have amazing starters. Don't miss the Afghan chicken! Main course is good too. Quick service. Rich food! They don't compromise on butter and oil!
4.5,"This place was highly recommended by friends however we were warned that it is the food that we need to go there for and not the ambience. We went in for a family dinner on a weekday. The place is easily accessible just off 100 ft road and is located on the first floor.   Just as we were told about the ambience, the place has a very simple dhaba like feel with plain interiors.The place was crowded. We were given a table very quickly and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Chicken Chat is a must try and so their Paneer preparation in methi curry (I don't know the name since that is how the staff explained). We ordered a Chicken and Mutton curry, which was lip smacking.  Staff are very warm and friendly, they know their offerings in and out and are happy to customise them to your taste. If you want a full on Punjabi meal, this is the place to go to."
5.0,"Omg,what to say about the tasty food here.if anybody looking for authentic punjabi food around indiranagar pls dont miss thus place.the rustic ambience and real taste here brings you back again.we tried aloo parathas and paneer malmal ,and then added veg koft with extra spice.good job guys all the best.  The presentation of food is quite punjabisque. We have always started with chicken malai tikka which I feel is their best prepared dish. Alternately you could try the chicken seekh kebab which is better although I am of the view that the authentic seekh kebab is best done with mutton!!! In main course we have had butter chicken and mutton roganjosh which are quite tasty as per their reputation. We tried biriyani once which you may avoid though. But the butter kulchas are best with any gravy items."
4.0,"Have been there a few times, Wonderful food is one word to completely describe the place. Who cares for ambience :P  Anyways rating time:  Quality of food/hygiene: 1/1 Taste: 1/1 Ambience: 0.6/1 Value for money: 0.6/1 (breads very expensive) Service: 0.6/1 (takes time to serve you)"
3.5,Loved the food here ... chicken preparations are spicy and has pungent smell of masalas... the exclusive kheema paratha is a must try...other stuffed parathas are also good.Food is good but waiting time is long ....also indiranagar eat out needs some renovation.
4.5,"The Authentic Punjabi Food is here. Awesome food, cosy ambience and great attentive staff has stole my heart. I had a great time  with my friends at this place. Food was awesome and staff was cooperative and supportive. Punjabi food lovers this place is Heaven for u all. Must visit the place"
4.0,Food is good !! Nice ambience..... The cost is little towards teh higher end but then value for money... Overall enoyed the place and the food both ...
4.0,"If u r a non-vegetairian, this place will be heaven for u. After a long time, i ate such a delicious chicken tikka in bangalore. Proper north indian taste. It was so spicy. My mouth is watering while writing this post. :)"
1.5,Service was average and waiters treat customers based on there level!!! Please improve this espicially on weekends. Ambience was good though
3.5,"Punjabi Rasoi is quiet famous in Indira Nagar. However, i didn't find it much pleasing. Good ambience, average food and pocket friendly.  Ambience: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Service : 3.5/5 Value for money: 4/5  I would still recommend this place."
3.5,"The ambience is nice. Service was prompt and good. We had tandoori chicken, keema paratha, amritsari kulcha and chicken butter masala. Chicken tandoori, paratha and kulcha were good. Chicken Butter masala was a bit sweet. Would definitely go again though."
5.0,"This is located in the lane behind the petrol bunk. The presentation of food is quite punjabisque. We have always started with chicken malai tikka which I feel is their best prepared dish. The non veg eaters were feasting on chicken, and they hogged the babycorn too which we had to repeat. Then came the lassi which was good and almost filled the hungry tummy. Veg kofta and dum aloo with butter rotis were ordered and the dum aloo is a must have. Tasted perfect ! The food did not disappoint at all. This is a perfect place to have good punjabi food which is also light on the pocket."
1.5,"Not the Punjabi rasoi that I have experienced in RT Nagar. We were 12 of us and went for dinner with great hopes. There were no vineger dipped onions on the table. Taste wise the paneer achaari is way apart from that of RT Nagar. Felt as if it was cooked in haste. We ordered egg chilli, soya tikka and babycorn Manchuria which were all good. Ordered kulcha, stuffed kulcha, phulka dal makhni and kadai paneer along with egg biryani. They were all good and nothing special about the taste or way it was cooked. The worst part of experience was their service. The man person who was attending to us was lost in his own world, unable to take orders properly. We order Gobi stuffing and he says onion aalu stuffing. At 9:45 when we ordered phulka and curd rice he said both were unavailable. Later he says it will take 20 mins for phulka to be made and it will be served after the other main course dishes. They did not have any desserts except gulab jamoon. Overall, a bad experience , rude person who was attending to us and non availability of desserts and 20 mins to make phulkas!!! I would give this place a skip next time, way better options in the area available."
3.0,"The food served was awesome. I had dinner here , ordered paneer starter , along with roti, daal and mix veg in main course.Service was good as well."
3.5,"My friend introduced me to this place. Typical north Indian flavour, loved the taste. Ambience is decent too. Only problem I found was the food is too oily. Considering the fact that it is north Indian restaurant once in a while I think it's ok."
4.0,"Since I got food ordered online, this review is strictly based on it. Everything I ordered tasted great, living upto its 'Punjabi' name. Recommended one is their Kadai paneer which was cooked and spiced to perfection. The portion size of the main course was decent too. The outlet delivered good value for money, except the starters which I found to be pricey considering the quantity offered.Overall, it was one great meal. Definitely one of the best options in the area for North Indian food."
3.5,Went to Punjabi Rasoi on a monday evening when the weather was all gloomy! The traffic actually killed me..getting here was actually the biggest problem as the old airport road fully jammed. You should take this also into account when you think abt going to this place.. The place looks really tiny from outside and the insides are quite nice.. one problem for me was the lighting! Really Dull and dark. The service was ok and now coming to the food we ordered the Nargisi Tikka! It was served alogside a bed of Onion Salad and mint chutney. The chicken had a nice char on it and was really tasty. I think its a must try dish here..the quantity was really good and the chicken was really tender! We followed it up with the main course! We ordered Butter Naan and 2 gravies.. Chicken kadai and Mutter Panner! The butter naan's were really soft and tasty. I loved them! The Mutter Panner also was good. Lots of panner in a spicy/sweet gravy. The chicken kadai however was alright. I felt the chicken was a bit hard. Though the gravy was tasty. I think this is a good Punjabi Restaurant but could improve on their service a bit more.
3.0,"A decent punjabi place for lunch and/or dinner. From outside, it doesn't look so appealing. But once entered, it's a small eatery with lot of tables. Many tables with 4 chairs are arranged, some are very close. It might looked a little cramped with all tables full. Otherwise ambiance was good. Kites are hanged on walls n roof.  We first ordered paneer achari and gobi tandoori. Paneer achari was very yummy. It's mentioned on menu that paneer n pickles are made homemade. Paneer was very delicious. Soft and tasty. I would suggest paneer items to vegetarian foodies. Gobi tandoori was not so great. Some big cauliflower pieces were uncooked inside. Later, we had paneer punjabi and dal tadka along with kulchas and naans. Dal was very nice. Subtle punjabi flavors. We were told that Paneer punjabi would be spicy but it was actually tangy, not spicy at all. I reckon they just put lot of tomatoes in it. We could taste the imbalance. This preparation could have been better. Kulcha and Naan both were ok. In drinks, we had buttermilk and Lassi. Both were good.  Service was quick. Staff was welcoming and soft spoken. Cost was little on highest side. For 3 people, Bill was Rs. 1200.  Overall, Ambiance 3/5 Food 2.5/5 Beverages 4/5 Service 4/5 Value for food 3/5"
4.5,Have been going to the restaurant for a couple of years since I was introduced to it by friends. It has one of the best North Indian dishes available at a reasonable price. This is probably the only place I got a decent missi roti and malai kofta in Bangalore. The chicken dishes are very good. I especially adore the Chicken Lababdaar.  I would recommend it to lovers of North Indian food.  Its good to go a bit early especially on weekends to avoid queues.
3.5,"Bad service and the owner knows it. Lol. Food is good. The usual Indian vegetable shd curries you order are great here. It wasn't crowded but still service was bad. The staff was fighting and arguing among themselves. You could feel their lack of concern in service. It should matter for a so called fine dining restaurant. DO NOT visit here during late hours on weekends and cricket days, you will spoil your experience."
1.0,"WARNING: AVOID THIS RESTAURANT (FOOD POISONING)  We went for a team dinner  - Food was bad in terms of taste and hygiene - Had loose motions  We ordered Chicken Roghan Josh, Kababs which were exceptionally bad. It looked like they reduced the quality in order to serve quickly. Waiters bought in different items which we didn't order. There was an instance, when I ordered butter chicken and the chicken was green in colour. Looked like they put the hariyali chicken in the gravy. Waiter was like chicken turned green while cooking. lol.  Apparently the head waiter was smiling mockingly as though he knew about the bad food.I have been to this place several times, this was the worst experience.Dishonest, unhealthy and gross. Absolute loose motion material. Went there again and WOW this place hasn't changed a bit.Food was the usual loose motion material, for 1000 bucks all we go was crap food which led to loose motions in the morning. CLOSE THIS PLACE ALREADY!"
4.0,One of the cheap and best restaurants you find in her layouts Always crowed when ever I go there. But the service fast with respect to the crowd what they have.
4.0,"We have ordered several times from this place and we have found the food delicious. Our favourite is the butter chicken, chicken bartha and tawa chicken"
4.5,"A great choice for Delhi/Punjabi food. Hard to spot (on first floor) but worth all the trouble. Nargisi chicken is a unique starter they offer , tastes great. I have tried it multiple times , chicken gravies are distinctly Punjab style , Breads are made well. Daal Makhani, Chicken lababdar a must try. If you are missing Delhi/Punjab non veg food, head there straight for a economical fill. Forgot to add Achar Pachranga in its original taste is served too :-)"
4.0,Nice food with a nice ambiance that will cheer up your taste buds. Expect a long waiting on weekends. The service is slow and can pump your frustration level. Try out their non-veg and Lassi at the end of your meal.
4.0,Ordered 4 different starters and all were very good.  Opted for amritsari kulcha nd kashmiri naan along with punjabi chicken for main course. My personal favourite amongst all the dishes was the malai tikka. Liked the mango lassi too.
3.0,"SERVICE was too bad. We waited outside for 30 minutes which was OK due to weekend. First, we ordered starters which arrived 15 minutes later. Then, we ordered main course and it took another 15 minutes to arrive. When food arrived, breads were not properly cooked and half of the order didn't arrived. We were again waiting for breads to arrive while daals were getting cold.  The only thing I liked about the restaurant is that they accepted their mistake and didn't charged us for breads.  About food, I ordered mushroom masala which was OK.   It was bad experience for first time, but others told me that the restaurant is good, somehow they messed up today."
3.0,The food is average. If you try their RT Nagar branch you can feel the difference in taste. The place has lost its quality in last few years. It was very good some 3 yrs back but each time its detoriating
4.0,"A decent place for North Indian cusinise. Ambience is unique, quantity and quality of food is also good and at the same time it is quite reasonably priced."
3.5,"Been there for birthday party  Restaurant has typical North Indian atmosphere We tried Afghan chicken , chicken chaat  Both were smacking good tandoor is best part here one can be more confident taste wise to order tandoor based items  Big turn off was no mutton dishes may be because we reached the place  Other food such as were not so great  Lassi 4 out of 5 Aam panna full marks   Give a try I don't know mostly I like starters only at Punjabi hotel  Cheers"
3.0,Ambience is OK. Service was not good. Staff members did not even cared for their customers. Khana was good. Dal makhni was awesome. Worth a try if u love to eat north indian food.
1.0,its very worst in food preparation i have ordered for veg i found chicken pics in that its very very bad  PATHETIC..PATHETIC...PATHETIC.V.
3.5,"The lassi here is a must have. Add to it a paneer curry and some bread, and the best lunch is ready. The place is a little hard to spot. Highly recommended."
1.0,"Food : We ordered  Soup: Hot and Sour Veg - Horrible, the consistency of the soup was really bad. Felt like the soup was on a cost cutting mode as the soup lacked the thickness and the punch  Looks like they had just one bowl of soup and decided to serve it to 10 people by adding water.  If you are Punjabi specialty restaurant, i don't understand why you are compelled to serve such pathetic soups. Just stick to what you cook best.  After the soup experience, we didn't dare to order any other dish.  Summary Food : 1/5 Ambience : 2/5 Staff : 3/5"
5.0,"Just as we were told about the ambience, the place has a very simple dhaba like feel with plain interiors.The place was crowded. We were given a table very quickly and the staff were very friendly and attentive. We ordered achari chicken and malai chicken boneless for the starters along with a boondi raita. For the drinks we placed an order for sweet lassi and a jal jeera. For the main course we chose for a butter chicken, daal makhani, mix of plain, butter and garlic naan and a jeera rice. The achari chicken was juicy and had a tangy taste. The malai chicken also had soft tender pieces of chicken. We were left craving for more. The lassi and jal jeera tasted equally good.  North indian food at its best!! a must visit place!!!"
3.5,The food was purely punjabi which was great to have. Aunthentically punjabi !!! The service was also ok. Do try the tandoori chicken and butter chicken
5.0,"This is located in the lane behind the petrol bunk. The presentation of food is quite punjabisque. We have always started with chicken malai tikka which I feel is their best prepared dish. Alternately you could try the chicken seekh kebab which is better!! Cost is reasonable considering the quality and quantity of food. If you are a localite in Indira nagar area, you must be knowing how good the restaurant it. Strictly recommended if you are looking for Punjabi cuisine."
1.0,"Good food.  I ordered at 9 :50 PM and expected the food to be delivered by 10:45PM. I called three times n the order taker said that it will take 10 minutes, however food never reached. At 11:30 Pm delivery boy called to look for my house. Highly disappointed by the way it was handled. If the food is getting delayed for any reason, at least inform the customer."
4.5,"I dinned at their HSR Layout outlet & found it really good. This time we reached for a Saturday Dinner quite late at night around 10.40 pm, thank god they let us in. We quickly got seated & ordered food as they were heading for closing of kitchen, food came so fast & we finished it as quick as well, not because of the time crunch but because of the finger licking taste. :) Chicken chat is an awesome dish  we tried. The paneer tikka was a little cold but good in taste.Rates are reasonable. A good choice if you want to have some typical Punjabi Cuisine.                                                                 eatcapturetravel.wordpress.com"
4.0,"Omg,what to say about the tasty food here.if anybody looking for authentic punjabi food around indiranagar pls dont miss thus place.the rustic ambience and real taste here brings you back again.we tried aloo parathas and paneer malmal ,and then added veg koft with extra spice.good job guys all the best."
3.5,Except for the service everything else was just perfect.  They made us to wait really looooong.  The food was great and their lassi was awesome.  We ordered parathas and some curries.  It was lip smacking.
1.0,We ordered food at 8:30 pm and it was not delivered till 11 in the night. When we open the food it was all non veg where as our order didn't contain any non veg item. Person speaking to us was very rude and not taking properly. He said he will resend the order and he didn't deliver for another 1 hr and was very rude. Super fustrated. Very bad service.
4.0,"Iam die hard fan of their chicken bharta... and of course the tandoori too.. as the name suggests being a punjabi place, the lassi is must have.."
4.0,Have been to this restaurant couple of times and what I really liked is non veg starters. Chicken chat and chicken lasoni kebab is my favorite and I recommend to try this
3.5,"Been to the restaurant once.. Ambience is gud..  Once ordered for home delivery..  Loved the food but don't know why always felt like something is missing.. E.g. Paneer bhurji, felt like it was bit out of taste, same goes for biryani.. Will try again for sure .."
4.5,"Just another mainstream punjabi restaurant serving north indian dishes. but the unique thing is the quantity of the dishes which is exceptional and very filling. The food was very tasty - especially the melts-in-your-mouth malai kebabs, and it didn't stay on the plates for long. If i am in the city again for a few days, will ensure to visit again. Recommended if you are looking for Punjabi cuisine."
4.0,At last here my dinner ends up with the Punjabi food! Waah man ko chahh ditta! Sasoo ta saag and makke Di roti.. Butter naan chicken tandoori... Waah bhai waah!! Ambiance is super cool...it gives the vibe of punjab! I even love the pan corner which is infront of the door! All along it is amazing!
1.0,Pathetic service. Arrogant manager too. They are more busy in watching IPL matches than serving. 1 hour to serve us while the place was not even half full. Even after that we couldn't get what we ordered. Food did not taste good.  My rating : -5  Worst place I have seen.
3.5,"Known for its authentic Punjabi dishes, I had gone out for dinner with friends. Dal makhani was amazing. Also other dishes which you get in any Punjabi restaurant tastes good. Usually this place is crowded in the evenings and would have to wait to get a table. But overall had a good experience."
1.0,"Ordered delivery, had a terrible experience.  'Gobi tandoori' was just boiled cauliflower with spices.  The gravy and biryani were tasteless too.  Food was pretty cold. Absolutely disappointed."
4.5,"Being a Punjabi, was always looking out for a place that would offer authentic Punjabi food.  Search is over. Thanks to Punjabi rasoi. :D   Great place to go with family. Only issue will be the service. As it usually takes around 15-20 minutes for your order to come."
3.5,I have been there with my friends for celebrating a Birthday party. This place serves good North Indian food at affordable prices. Paneer is tender and delicious. I was happy with the starters but not that much with main course. Ambience is not that good. Food: 3.5/5 Ambience : 3/5 Service : 3.5/5
4.0,"Love the cool interiors to sit and chat up with friends, very friendly place cause items here are not costly. Can relay after a good meal with a cool drink. Love the style of their menu too."
5.0,"It's our go to place now. We love the food here. Not only is it delicious, it doesn't really burn our pockets. The service is really good and it is totally worth trying."
3.5,"In search of an unexplored place we landed up in The Punjabi Rasoi. At the very push if the front door , the aroma the decor gave me a rustic ... Authentic punjabi kitchen feel. It was really late when we stepped in, the IPL was on, the last few diners were more engrossed in the match than food , while the servers and waiters finished their chores and enjoyed the match too. In this kind of an atmosphere we were the last to enter and at the very onset reminded 'order faast , this is the final order'. We ordered for Ra ra murg and kashmiri naan (tried for the first time, apparently its little sweet - with pineapple inside) & regular kulcha. When it came to the table we realized this is way too much than we can have even at that 'super hungry' state.  We had only the kashmiri naan and a chicken, rest we had to 'pack for us' Food was extremely good. Ambience was nice. nice place to explore more than once.                                                                 avrilsfoodjournee.com"
4.0,"This is a nice punjabi place. Both vegetarian and non-veg dishes taste good. Few all time favourites would be malai tikka, butter chicken, palak paneer and laccha parantha.  They do serve a dry fruit curry as well which is unique and very rich. If you like a sweet cashew nut gravy, with a lot of dry fruit then this a dish for you. Not for me though, couldn't eat most of it."
1.0,Ordered food from this place... First time it was really good but the second time it was bad and bad as in worse starting off the food was half an hour late and that was after I called them thrice and 2nd the food was not good at all... I ordered dal makhni which turned out to be sour yes SOUR FOOD and butter phulka which was okay not that great and the jeera rice was okay and no salt... And the worst thing the person who delivered it had handled the package so badly that the food was out of the containers and spilled on the polythene bags.... So that was just plain pathetic and disgusting.... I m never ordering from the restaurant even again... I'd rather starve.
4.0,"This is located in the lane behind the petrol bunk. The presentation of food is quite punjabisque. We have always started with chicken malai tikka which I feel is their best prepared dish. Alternately you could try the chicken seekh kebab which is better although I am of the view that the authentic seekh kebab is best done with mutton, which I didn't find that delicious here.   In main course we have had butter chicken and mutton roganjosh which are quite tasty  as per their reputation. We tried biriyani once which you may avoid though. But the butter kulchas are best with any gravy items. I preferably go for butter naan but here in Punjabi Rasoi I have loved the butter kulchas more than butter nan.   Cost is reasonable considering the quality and quantity of food. If you are a localite in Indira nagar area, you must be knowing how good the restaurant it. Strictly recommended if you are looking for Punjabi cuisine."
3.0,Decent place to have north indian fare... Dint like the ambience and the way it is set up. Dal makhni and chicken gravy was good... Lacha parantha even better... A bit pricey as compared to others from the same segment...
4.5,"This place has one of the best north Indian food.  I have gone their 2-3 times, ambience is good so is service. We tried chicken chaat which was really tasty (if you like spicy food), tomato soup was really good. The best dish of this restaurant had to be Dal makhani."
3.5,"A good healthy and tasty Punjabi food, Ambience is unique, Quantity and quality of food is also good Little bit slow service, Reasonable price, Must try lassi.. yumi ..."
5.0,"The best Punjabi food in Bangalore is available here. From chicken tikka to paneer tikka masala , everything here is worth trying. Don't try the lassi though it may disappoint you. The best is Afghani chicken , chicken all wrapped in Mayo roasted at its best. It is bit on the costlier side but every piece is worth it. This is the place I go to when money doesn't matter but taste does."
4.0,Superb finger lickin food... easy on your pocket... what else do you need.. :D  Tried aam pana and buttermilk.. that was the only thing which was okay... other than that.. babycorn chilly too good... panner tikka masala.. and veg kofta.. both were awesome... Masala rice was amazing... we were so full couldn't try any sweets there... must try for North Indians... :)
3.5,"The food is lavish north Indian cuisine, just as all the Punjabi folks I know would love it. The service though I feel is a little slow in terms of waiting to get a place but you would not be disappointed by their Rotis and the main course dishes. I would suggest you hit this place with a complete empty stomach. Serves good veg and non-veg dishes. This you should try are garlic naan and dal makhni best so far I have had around so far in Bangalore. Prices are slightly on the other side if you compare to usual Punjabi dhabas but then again the quantity is quite filling."
2.5,"I am rating this place 2.5 for the only sole reason and that is its food, which has lots of option for veg and non-veg both as it's tasty as well. But when it comes to service this place is worst , the waiter are not so bothered about the customers as they can see that crowd is coming because of their food . We had to wait for 10 minutes for the bill to come to us from the time we asked for it and then there was no machine available to swipe the card and again we had to wait for 5 minutes to get the card swiped , and I could there were other people waiting for the same reason and shouting as they were waiting from long time , During all this the waiters and other restaurant staff were not bothered , very disappointed from this place and will hardly suggest about this place to anyone. There were issues with parking your vehicles as well. Ambiance was fine tried to give it a dhaba Wala look by placing kites on roof. Overall not so good experience with this place"
3.0,"Saturday lunch and punjabi rasoi..seemed like a good match....  The place is easy to find which is right off the 100 ft road but finding a parking spot is a bit tricky.   The ambience is average with lots of kites on the roof and lots of waiters just ambling around.. :)   Coming to food, we ordered the normal punjabi food of Nan, punjabi chicken curry, dal makhani , butter milk.  You cant go wrong with punjabi food, can you?? only if you add a bit more salt than required .. The food was average with and extra dose of salt in the curry and the dal.. It was edible though..  The staff is really nice and helpful and courteous. On an average, an average rating for this place.. Should be better than this i guess given its average rating is good."
4.0,"This place was suggested by a colleague and was skeptical by the ratings on zomato for this restaurant. Decided, we head to this restaurant near the bda complex, indiranagar. Surprisingly, the place was full and we had to wait for the table. The ambience isn't great. The roof is pasted with full of kites, but it's the food which brings people to this restaurant. Doesn't give the dhaba feel as well.   We ordered the starters while we waited for the table.  Veg : babycorn tandoor and gobi tandoor. The babycorn was nicely done and tasted good. The gobi tasted just ok.  The non veg eaters were feasting on chicken, and they hogged the babycorn too which we had to repeat. Then came the lassi which was good and almost filled the hungry tummy. Veg kofta and dum aloo with butter rotis were ordered and the dum aloo is a must have. Tasted perfect ! The food did not disappoint at all. This is a perfect place to have good punjabi food which is also light on the pocket."
3.0,"Seatrr organized their first bloggers meet at this place for dinner! I had so much of expectations about the place. However, I wasnt happy and convinced with the Food and Service. The restaurant is located off 100 feet road in Indiranagar. The restaurant has a decent ambiance with dim lights and dcor looks more like a Dhaba. We were dining at first floor and surprisingly, all the tables were completely occupied at 7pm. The tables are slightly congested, which needs to be sorted at high attention. Being a Vegetarian, I could see good number of options on the menu, thats something really good. The restaurant folks were very kind enough to suggest and served some of their fast selling and signature dishes. We tried Paneer Tikka, Paneer Maalamal, Aam Panna, Mango Lassi, Dal Makhni, Aloo Sabzi and Indian Breads. Paneer Tikka was one of the best ever I had and it was marinated and cooked with perfection. It was super soft and just melts with the Chili Mint Chutney. We can judge a North Indian restaurant based on the taste of Dal Makhni. But here, I wasnt so happy, because it was too creamy. This could have been better! Indian breads were ok and nothing much can talk about. I ordered Peas Pulao and they totally forgotten. However, it was served when my friend ordered. I wasnt bothered much, but these are the small things, which Management needs to focus. Aam Panna was so refreshing, chilled and Tangy  A must try drink at this place. Mango Lassi was a showstopper and adored by everyone in the gang. It was thick, sweetish and refreshing though. However, it was warm and they could have done something to keep the drink cold. We havent paid the bill, since it was a bloggers meet. But prices seem to be pretty ok, when you look at the menu. I will be visiting soon and try out some other dishes.                                             bangaloreepicure.com"
4.5,"For the first time ever after a very long time I had something which felt like irresistible! Went there at peak lunch hour and had ordered Mutton Masala, Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Lababdar with Kulcha and oh boy, it was just so delicious! Had gone there in a large group and the food price was nominal and in good quantity. I hope they maintain the quality and service and try to attract more customers with faster and streamlined services. Cheers and Happy Binging! ;-)"
4.0,"A decent place to be for North Indian cuisine.  Okayish ambience, good food and not too heavy on the pocket. Beverages may let you down though so don't experiment when it comes to drinks - play safe with the usual ones (buttermilk or lime juice/ soda). One of the good things about this place is that it serves good food and at the same time is quite reasonably priced. An option to reckon always when North Indian cuisine is on the Hogg list."
4.0,If you craving some good butter chicken and dal makhani yes it's the correct place on 100 ft road. Ambience is really cool as well as the hospitality.
4.0,"This place was highly recommended by friends however we were warned that it is the food that we need to go there for and not the ambience. We went in for a family dinner on a weekday. The place is easily accessible just off 100 ft road and is located on the first floor.  Just as we were told about the ambience, the place has a very simple dhaba like feel with plain interiors.The place was crowded. We were given a table very quickly and the staff were very friendly and attentive. We were served by Buddha who was extremelyhelpful, friendly and had a smiling face throughout.  We called for achari chicken and malaichickenboneless for the starters along with aboondi raita. For the drinks we called for sweet lassi and ajal jeera. For the main course we called for a butter chicken, daal makhani, mix of plain, butter and garlic naan and a jeera rice.  The achari chicken was juicy and had a tangy taste. The malai chicken also had soft tenderpieces of chicken. We were left craving for more. The lassi andjal jeera tastedequally good.  The butter chicken was creamyand the best I've had so far. The breads were great as well. The daal makhani was rich and buttery. These gravies tasted very good with the rice as well.  A meal without a dessert is incomplete so we called for the gulab jamuns which were fresh and hot. They were gone in seconds.  This is definitely the place if you are looking for some awesome punjabi / north indian food."
3.5,"Well if you are looking for decent north indian food,  then this place won't disappoint you. It has a good balanced vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian menu and its also not too much on your packet. The paneer butter masala is a total delight and must try. The only downside is the service which is slow so you must order the food in one go."
3.0,"Visited Punjabi Rasoi for a Bloggers Meet organised by Seatrr. Apart from equipping ourselves with the new food app in town, I also got to dine in with some of the finest Food bloggers of the city.  Ambiance : Restaurant is on the first floor, the seating is slightly congested and narrow. Dim lights and decor gives a Dhaba feel while dining.  Service & Price : As I was here as a part of a bloggers meet, I would not consider myself fit to comment on these aspects. Shall update after my casual visit in future.  Food : Even after a fortnight, the taste and feel of Mango Lassi has been lingering in my mouth. Totally loved it and surely a must try here.  Out of the starters served, I enjoyed chicken kebab which was marinated in Mayonnaise. It was amazingly soft and well cooked with right amount of spices.  Chicken Malaamal was something that we had a lot of expectations, but it turned out to be very salty and even after getting it replaced, my taste buds couldn't really appreciate it.  Dal Makhani was good for my palate, though not the best one I have had so far. Breads were pretty average. Garlic Naan was decent out of it.  Overall it was average with the taste. For Punjabi cuisine in and around Indiranagar, go ahead with it.                                             knowfoodknowme.wordpress.com"
4.5,Beat place to have Punjabi food in Bangalore. I have been here multiple times and always i like the food.   Malai kofta and kadAi paneer is just awesome. Pujabi lassi is also good. Sarso ka saag i always order which is awesome. Amritsari kulcha is best in their breads.  Decent ambiance and good service.
1.0,"We ordered food from this restaurant on 9 April 2016 , the restaurant owner called and told our address is out of the delivery area. On requesting him and asking why it's then accepting orders then he started saying very bad slangs involving my mother and father (like mc and bc). Will never order food from zomato again and I am going to my reporter friends and police tomorrow morning with the recorded conversation. Even couldn't find an emergency number to speak to from Zomato's side after all this. Why isn't there a -1 rating ?"
4.0,"Punjabi Rasoi was an experimental visit for us. I had heard a lot of mix opinions about the place before going there, after going there I realised why.   The place is not likeable to those who are high on ambience and aesthetics, but for the foodies it's nothing less than heaven.   We chose to go by the staff recommendation for all the dishes and he did an amazing job. Chicken Chat is a must try and so their Paneer preparation in methi curry (I don't know the name since that is how the staff explained). We ordered a Chicken and Mutton curry, which was lip smacking.   Staff are very warm and friendly, they know their offerings in and out and are happy to customise them to your taste.   If you want a full on Punjabi meal, this is the place to go to."
1.0,"Never ever dare to order from this restaurant in life. They can serve Non-veg and apologies by the word Sorry......that's it. This is human error which can happen.  Please think 110 times before ordering. I suggest its better to stay hungry instead of making a vegetarian eat non-veg. There should be strict actions to be taken against these kind of restaurant.  Vegetarians please think again n again before ordering or dining at this place.    The owner statement, "" ITS BOTH NON_VEG AND VEG RESTAURANT SO MISTAKE CAN HAPPEN...SORRY"""
3.0,"A meetup is always a good thing  1) to meet some new foodies and share memories with the old and 2) for all the yummy food. Seatrr, a new app launched in Bangalore gave some of us the opportunity to speak between bites at Punjabi Rasoi, Indira Nagar. What we ordered was what Seatrr was all about  choose the best dish from each restaurant.

3.5,"This is one of Punjabi Restaurant that has been around for a while in Bangalore.  I have somehow not got a chance to visit this place.  The reason for that could have been that it is located in Koramangala or the simple reason that I havent heard too many of my known friends talking about it. Its hard to say but then I am very much sure that this was a place that I have missed.  Coz there is something special about the food that is served in this place.  I think the owners of this place want to bring in the authenticity in the food.  And to large extent they have been able to do so.  I am taking about none other than Punjabi Rasoi that is located in Indranagar.  Location  To be able to reach this place consider yourself coming from the Domlur flyover side.  Drive along until you hit upon the traffic signal at CMH Road Junction.  Cross the signal and then drive along for 300-400 mtrs.  Take left, which is the same road that goes to BDA complex directly.  Punjabi Rasoi comes to the left side on the 1st floor.  Another direction to reach this place is from the Old Madras Road.  Drive along until you find the 80ft Road at Indranagar.  Take left and then immediate right turn.  Punjabi Rasoi comes to the left side in 200mts.  Ambiance  The place is pretty nice, but surely not fancy.  Let me share about few things I saw.  Entrance on the group floor has dances structure stuck on the wall.    There are disco lights on the name of the restaurant in the ground level.  As you are about to enter the restaurant, you can see a Paan shop which is quite nice coz its very common in North or South to have paan after meals.  Entrance has 2 section, one to the right and the other to the left side.  Left side, you need to take a step up.    The first thing you notice is that all the seats are nicely setup.  And most importantly almost full.  Tables are neatly arranged, which for sure is a sign of an established restaurant.  On an average I think this place run 70-80% full coz of its popularity.  Food  The most important reason for people to go here is the food.  I have had a mixed opinion on the food I had, let me share my thoughts.  Paneer Tikka  This was one of the best Paneer I have eaten after long time.  The reason is that the restaurant makes their own paneer.  The owner told that the paneer is made from buffalo milk and there is nothing sourced from outside.  It also means that the process has been so well defined and setup that they dont go wrong after ages of restaurant being in business.  The taste with the mint-chutney is awesome.  And yes, you can take some salad also along with the paneer.  Paneer Maalamaal  A dish which had a very unique name attracted my attention and I thought of ordering this dish.  And when the dish came, it seemed to be like the contemporary paneer butter masala.  But there was a variation in terms of the spices that were put inside it.  The paneer is anyways quite soft like the other dish I mentioned.  Masala is also quite tasty.  Infact, many of my friend who were there also loved the dish.  Aloo Subji  The contemporary potato subji which is prepared dry and is one of the curry that people take with the tandoori roti.  The dish was pretty fine and the aloo was pretty well cooked.  But somehow I did not enjoy the dry masalas that much.    Sarson Ka Saag  A dish which is one of the famous dishes from North which is to be taken with Makai Roti / Corn Roti.  The speciality is that they would add a lot of ghee on the Makai roti to get the flavour.    This place the curry was not up to the mark. The dish was quite salty and even with the Makai roti which is generally a bit blandish, the taste was not coming out all that well. I guess this was a bit surprise coz I thought they might have made this number of times in the past.  But whatever was served was not right.  Infact, couple of other foodies also felt the same about the dish.  Paratha / Roti  I had Laccha Paratha which was pretty fine.  Its hard to go wrong in this item coz it is more like the basic similar to Tandoori Roti.  Makai Roti again was not up to mark coz it was looking reddish.  I wonder if chilly was added into the dove while making.  There was not much ghee which is traditionally put on the Makai roti.  Peas Pulao + Raita  Rice was pretty decently cooked but for some reason I was getting some eggy feeling while tasting it.  Not sure if it was due to the bad experience of the previous dish.  With the raita it sure did taste better.  Drinks  Mango Lassi  This was one of the really good drinks I have had in sometime.  I wonderful it was the drink or the weather itself.  Whatever it was, I felt quite refreshing.  The only thing I felt was the that lassi needs to be churned well, sometimes you get a feeling that curds was churned a little bit.  Usually a traditionally lassi would also have the butter on top which makes it quite healthy.  Overall Experience  It was good going to a place with foods who equally understand the significance of good food.  Nice to have discovered a place in Indranagar where you can get some decent Punjabi food.  There are a few issues that I have mentioned in my review which I hope they do work and correct it.  My current rating for this place would be 3.5/5.    My rating in other departments.  Food  3.5/5  Service  3.5/5  Ambiance  3.5/5  Drinks  3.5/5  Food for 2 will cost anywhere between INR 600-1000 depending on the dishes you order and the hunger level.                                             fodyssey.com"
4.0,The atmoshere is nice and cool. The set up and ambiance is really good. The staff were freindly and helped in odering the food. A really good variety of dishes and a nice collection of drinks also. Enjoyed the food alot and it had some really good flavours and aroma.
3.0,"Was at Punjabi Rasoi with some of the biggest foodies from Bangalore for a meet organised by Seatrr.   Ambience  Pass by this restaurant everyday on my way to work and from the outside you tend to miss this restaurant, in which is located on the first floor in a street full of small to medium sized food joints.   The interiors are decent and well maintained. Dining area is a little cramped and seating is comfortable.  Pricing Wont be fair to judge them on pricing as we were here as part of an event from Seatrr's bloggers meet.   Service The food was served reasonably fast and overall hospitality of service team was impressive. This was the case until they were packed, when things slowed down marginally.   Food Had huge expectations from this place since a few of my friends had given very positive feedback on their food. While there were a few dishes that won us over, there were a few that disappointed as well.   The wins:  mango lassi  chicken leg pieces (kebabs) served with a dose of mayonnaise/cream - don't remember the name  The fails:   Chicken malammal - was salty the first time and the management got this redone. While it was a lot better the second time.   The average cookies:  breads: garlic naan and pudhina parata  dal makhni - far from the best dal makhni's I have had; lacked the richness I expect from a dal makhni.   On a summary note, went with high expectations and the place did not completely live up to it. Try it out if you are looking for punjabi food in Indira Nagar.                                              bingingbanker.com"
4.5,"Awesome food. I ordered paneer jalfrezi, dal makhani, chur chur naan. Dal makhani was okay but the rest was very tasty. Service is very fast too."
4.0,The ambiance in this place is really nice calm and soothing. the food here is actually prety good compared to other punjabi restraunts. The service is excelent and the staff here are really sweet and served us with a smile on their face which actually makes me wanna com here again with my family.
4.5,"Mouth watering delicious food. Wow! What a soft paneer , great flavour and you could see the melting butter on hot parathas. Ambience is cool. A better punjabi rasoi compare to other rasois in the city .  Don't forget to have beeda just outside the entry door."
4.5,Good tasty food .  Appreciate the guy who takes order who has suggestions and help us in opting the best food available from the menu after understanding our taste .  Will visit again for sure .
2.5,"Me & my fianc been to a boutique in lndiranagar after-which planned for a lunch. I had a vague idea that this restaurant is there. Google helped us to reach the place. Ordered my fav chicken chat(it wasn't good, no comparison to HSR outlet), veg biryani(just ok), Aam panna(so watery, hsr outlet had set standards to me) & fresh lime soda(which they didn't had, so had to change to lassi). Service is good."
4.0,"The picture on the site no way matches how the place looks like.  Don't have much of an expectation from the decor, its a great place for North Indian food....that it!  Menu - Its has all the basics of a north ( Punjabi ) restaurant and inspite of being here for years have retained the North Indian flavour. The kebabs are nice but its the fried variety hence you may avoid the Chicken tangri and go for mutton or chicken sheek which will be grilled. The black dal and the paneer items are out of the world. The Paneer Lababdar & Kadai paneer are great.  We were told that the paneer supply for the day comes from Delhi freshly delivered daily, No wonder the paneer melts in your mouth.  If you are in a mood to have some north Indian food is a very relaxed setting you try this place.  Decor / Ambience : 2/5 Food : 4.5/5 Service : 4/5 Value : 5/5"
4.0,The place has authentic punjabi cuisine and is a very nice place to have dinners with family. The service is fast and they have a good terrace kind of setup with a pleasant ambiance.
1.5,"Decent food, a bit overpriced, efficient service, indifferent management.  The food was decent - We started with Tomato soup and masala papad - both were good. We ordered Kadai Veg, Phulkas and one Choor Choor Naan for main course. The Kadai Veg was good but not freshly prepared - it was not even hot. The Choor Choor Naan was great - stuffed with potato and onions. The Phulkas were a big let down - cold and prepared some 2-3 hours ago. On sending back the cold phulkas, we got the same phulkas slightly heated over a tawa. The Aam Panna (cold beverage) was really good.  The servers do a great job, very courteous. However, the one who took our order (looked like a manager / owner of the place) was only interested in seeing us finish our meal and clear the table. He was unpleasant and taking customers for granted.  Another surprise was the bill. They had charged Rs. 10/- extra for serving the Tomato Soup 1 by 2 !  Will not want to go back unless I run out of options."
4.0,I like the setting and design of this place. And the carrot halva in the dessert menu is like nothing i have ever tasted. Good ambiance and service was quick too.
4.5,This is an excellent place to have North Indian foods. Their service is very fast. The food is awesome. Veg people can try this place as they have a good choice for veg also.
4.0,"We visited Punjabi Rasoi today for a Monday dinner experience. The place at night looked ok ok and there was big LED tv running the cricket match. We were not planning on eating much.. We ordered the veg seekh kabab for starters which tasted good along with the curd+mint chutney. We also had the buttermilk to start. We soon jumped to the main course which was butter phulkas, garlic naan, aloo parata along with methi malai paneer. The gravy was good and it nicely complemented the breads. Overall, a good place for North Indian food. Only thing negative was the excess dripping ghee in all the food we had."
2.5,"An average place for a evening food, but not surely for a Sunday evening. Unfortunately, that's what we did.  Good decor. Decent portion. Average Taste. Poor Service. That's all to describe this place.  Well, we were a group of 10 people, so we were enjoying ourselves with lesser attention to food, otherwise it would have been disastrous for us as well for the place. They are very quick at forgetting the order placed. So you need not to wait if it's not served in first instance. You can assume it cancelled but still ask for cancellation to be on safer side.  They have water sprinkle fitted fans. But they are not helpful in beating the heat as they have covered the roof with artificial greenery and hence it is creating more moisture.  The only thing I liked about this place is they@ don't charge service charges. Hopefully they are aware that they are not giving any service and hence no charges. Other good thing is the location. If somehow you want to skip, there are lot of other options."
3.5,"A sudden plan on a beautiful evening to celebrate women's day brought me here. We were pretty early for dinner and were the first ones to be welcomed for the evening by the hosts. Seating was decent. I found the lighting to be a bit dull but the groovy music lifts your mood.   We were immediately attended and we started off with some creamy chicken soup and sweet lassi. It feels a little weird to have soups from steel bowls and spoons but the soup tasted creamy and we liked it. Then next we ordered the achari chicken and trust me, it was full of flavours. You will love every bite. It's finger licking good. The tangy pickle tinge did the trick for this dish and you won't regret having this.  For the main course we ordered Punjabi chicken which is little on the spicy side and chicken lababdar to go with tandoori rotis, butter naan and kulcha. The chicken lababdar stole the show. The combination with the bread basket was the ultimate soul satisfying combo. The Punjabi chicken had little heat to it but failed to do the magic with the taste buds. We also ordered Aam panna which was a khatta meetha combination and was an awesome drink to go the Indian food served. Overall a good satisfying experience.   Ambience -3/5 Food -3.5/5 Service -3.5/5 Value for money - 3.5/5"
1.0,"So I went to this so called good north indian food restaurant ""The Punjabi rasoi"" this afternoon for lunch with wifey and my 4 mnths old infant. As it was rated good on zomato and after checking out these reviews. Lunch timing says 12 pm to 3:30pm and we were there by 3: 07pm. As we entered saw their service staff and chef sitting on a waiting area I guess ( very lousy) and after asking if it is open directs us to restaurant door saying yes ,I saw open tag on the door and entered , was about to seat when a person in front of whom we entered comes and say ""bandh hai "" after looking at wall clock and speaking to his manager on the counter ( it was 3: 08pm by then) I mean pathetic attitude I turned the board saying open at the door to closed , you may be the serving best food but attitude and service matter a lot if you state a time on zomato or on social media adhere by it or change it. Unfortunately zomato doesn't have zero. DISAPPOINTED !!! Note: Owners be ware these guys are spoiling your image and business both."
4.5,"Very good for North Indian & punjabi food. Always loved tomato chicken served for starter. Last five year taste is same. Other dishes tried punjabi chicken, chicken lababdar are equally good."
4.0,"The punjabi rasoi is the one of the authentic punjabi food destination. as a non indian i can say that their food is upto mark with taste and cost. afghani chicken is mouth melting and awesome, tasty. all non veg starters were good. chicken is very tender and juicy. in veg starters i tried tandoori gobhi, which was good. In main course we had kadai paneer, punjabi chicken, stuffed kulcha, aloo paratha etc. all were good. paneer was very smooth. afghani chicken and kadai paneer are highly recommendable."
3.5,Nyc ambience but yes they have reduced their quality now adays had been twice but didnt found that punjabi rasoi which i knew a year ago. So hope they might maintain their quality of food but yes yet it is pocket friendly.
5.0,One of the best place to have authentic Punjabi (desi) food. Their each food dish is up to the mark. I Always visit once in a week here at indiranagar branch. If you like sweetness in dish try their methi malai chicken/paneer. Highly recommended.
4.5,"Had heard a lot about their food and Punjabi flavors. We reached there late at night, it was past ten if I am not wrong and surprisingly people were still waiting for their turn. They have a huge seating space here both indoor and al fresco. Luckily we got a seat in the outdoor seating area and the atmosphere was amazing. Old melodies poured into our ears and in spite of being stuffed with fellow diners, we had a separate space for us to enjoy the food. Now the food, as expected was awesome! The usual Malai Paneer Tikka with mint chutney made me drool ( they don't beat 1947 though). Nargis Kofta and the Kulchas were also tasty. The cost was a little on the higher side for us."
4.0,"Hi,  Had been here for Lunch today.  Ambience - Simple, Air Conditioned (Mentioned specifically since its importance is elevated during summers.), Clean. 3.5/5.  Food - We ordered Kadhai Chicken, Butter Kulcha, Mango Lassi. Every item on the table was finger - licking good! Including the chutney and the Supari served at the end! 4.5/5  Service - Well mannered, Super quick. 4/5  Deserves a multiple - revisit.  -Y"
4.0,"Decent quite ambience. Under trained staff, but very warm. The food in terms of quality and quantity is worth the money. Ordered palak kofta, chicken labaabdaar and tandoori chicken, great pieces of chicken, cooked to perfection. Good place to eat some punjabi food."
3.0,"Visited this place when I was studying Bangalore and was missing north Indian food. A delhiite friend of mine recommended the place so went there with very high expectations and that's where it failed. The place is just a regular northy restaurant being a restaurant in a area where there aren't many north Indian restaurants certainly has helped them. As they say in hindi, ""andho mei kaanda raja""."
3.5,Had dinner at this place. Tried a chicken malai tikka for starters which was good. Food taste and quality was good good. The service was quick and the ambience was fine. Overall a nice experience :)
4.0,"Nice tatse. Went to this restaurant yesterday with friend. Service was very good. Ordered tandoori gobi, chur chur kulcha, amrutsari kulcha, paneer shubji. Taste was really good. Paneer was so smooth."
3.5,Got to try zomato order with this place and pretty pleased how all the food just comes home directly at a nominal extra cost  cheers zomato  The veg food from this place is nice given that it's predominantly meat lovers' attraction for it's varied offering.
3.5,"Very pleasant and soothing ambience. Music was good. Rooftop with artificial grape garden look was different. Food is good. Not impressive. Limited veg starters! You know panner, corn,Gobi n soya! ;) all tandoori! Too much masala in drinks.  Main course was decent enough. Fairly priced for indiranagar area! Goon come back again."
3.5,"The Punjabi Rasoi, the name says it all. Being a Punjabi myself, I felt like ordering food online from here. To be fair, i ordered Afghani Chicken (in non-veg) and wasn't really impressed by the dish. It wasn't really juicy. The taste was a bit artificial.   Afghani chicken is meant to highly soaked in butter and creamy as the entire dairy cream was used here. Over here, it felt like it was cooked just for the sake of it. Wasn't bad but wasn't that good either.  Dal makhani was awesome, even was the kadahi paneer. But I had high expectations from the chicken."
5.0,Lovely place. Awesome food. Prompt and courteous service. Chicken dishes are fab. Must try chicken Punjabi. Good place for partying. Must visit place in Indiranagar.
4.5,Delicious with good quantity. Good North India Punjabi food you will find here. The PAN at gate of Restro is also good. Ambience is also very good.
4.0,"Excellent (oily) Punjabi food. Oh well, what did I expect :P. Love the kadhai chicken and paneer. Service can be better. Not as crowded as the HSR outlet."
3.0,"Went there on last sunday .foods are ok.service are ok.recommend only if no other options available,costly compared to other options in same location.NOT SATISFIED"
3.5,"Never judge a book from its cover! This phrase completely goes out for ""The Punjabi Rasoi"". A small staircase leading to a splendid 2 floor restaurant serves you really good punjabi food. We opted for a terrace seating which was kind of covered with fans in place. So for sunny lunch you can opt for terrace as well. For the food, we had ordered special nargisi chicken as a starter with hyderabadi chicken as the main course with some fresh lime soda. The nargisi Chicken was the speciality of the place and was simply lip smacking. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the little bit of gravy that it had just increased the taste. Hyderabadi chicken was good, slightly on the spicy side but yes i didn't find anything special about it. I would suggest to skip this dish and can opt for other main course dishes they have. Overall, if you are looking for a polished restaurant with some good food, then certainly this is not the place as it lacked lustre in all the areas related to service and ambiance. But yes if you looking just for the North Indian food, then you of course this is one of those places."
4.0,"Reached here on a Sunday afternoon. We sat on the second floor which had a splendid ambiance. It is a rooftop experience with a grapefruit setup in the ceiling. The service was also excellent. Now coming to the food.. Enjoyed everything we ordered. Afghani Chicken was delicious. Phulka with Punjabi chicken gravy was quite tasty. Mango lassi and Aam panna were too good. Absolutely enjoyed the food here.  Second visit was for dinner on a Sunday. This time we were seated on the first floor, which was not too great; too many tables placed in a small area and it felt congested. Chicken Chaat was pretty decent. Butter Chicken was below average."
4.0,Amazing place! Highly recommended! Yummy Panjabi food that comes in affordable price. The service is also decent. Has a good list for the starters and currys are a must try
2.5,This restaurant has shitty ambiance.... The service is not good at all....the waiter will keep bugging you to order quickly as if he is in hurry to close the restaurant.  On the other hand the food is really good...especially chicken is tenderous. But really disappointed with that they were serving hot lassi...
4.0,Paneer is brilliant ...simply awesome...it just meltsSo creamy n soft...and the chicken is amazing as well! Service ambience is amazing! Must try !!!
3.5,"When every restaurant turned their 'closed' or '2hours wait' status on us, it was Punjabi Rasoi that came to our rescue. We were probably their last customers that night and they arranged for a make-shift table to accommodate the 7 of us, very quickly. Extra thank you points for that!  Since it was the last order, we were asked to order everything in one go. None of the stuffed parathas and Roti options were available. There was some restriction on the availability of the side dish as well. We ordered Chicken tandoori and kebab for starters, Butter Naan, chicken lababdar, chicken methi malai, chicken patiala, chicken biryani for main course and lassi.  The starters were served with the usual chutney and onion, the main course was good. The Biryani seemed a little disappointing but I am not much of a biryani fan anyway. The mango lassi was okay, the normal lassi was fine but the chocolate lassi is the last thing that one should order from here. It tasted like bournvita!  It would be wrong of me to judge the quality of service or food because we arrived late on a day of utter rush (2nd January), however, could have been better."
3.5,"great food,pretty good ambience makes you feel like your in punjab.the sabjis are great especially the chicken lababdar.prices are pretty high but the taste of the food is amazing and is situated in a good place."
3.0,"My first visit to panjabi rasoi was disappointing one. Ambience was okay. We have ordered Kandahari, Afghani chicken and chicken achari, among all chicken items,  achari was good to eat rest items were okay. Service was pathetic non of the waiters were not responding. Finger bowl served with very cold water.  Biryani was not good."
4.0,I have been a regular visitor of this place at Indiranagar near the bda complex. This was my go to place when nothing comes to mind but you want to eat out. Excellent for your taste buds and pocket friendly at the same time. Serves brilliantly made non veg starters both Indian and Chinese. A must visit place. Keep yourself ready to wait to get a table if going on weekends for dinner as the place is packed.
4.0,Tried a chicken malai tikka for starters which was good. Even the main chicken dishes were great..quite close to the homely taste. The service was quick and the ambience was fine. Overall a nice experience :)
4.0,Amazing place to go and have real good north Indian food....the hyderabadi panner especially...spicy and really good. The dishes were well prepared. Just one thing that the service was a little slow... Otherwise good food. Must try!
4.0,"It's extremely surprising how great the food is here. There isn't much to say about the ambience, it's merely just tables and chairs,but man...the food.  The butter chicken and chicken lababdar are good enough to turn a besotted vegan.  The paneer malamal is a marvel in itself and the rotis are tender and absolutely lovely.  I can see myself heading here repeatedly."
4.0,Had dinner at this place. Food taste and quality is great. Service is also good. AmBience is ok. Completing 140 characters now..............
4.5,"Always a delight visiting this restaurant... It has really set the bar high in terms of pure authentic punjabi taste... Great service, Ambience, Quantity.. Bit costly but totally worth the price charged... All dishes listed are a must try!!"
1.0,"I had great expectations from this restaurant, but this is another overrated restaurant in Bangalore. Their non veg soup was so salty that it looked like they have used sea water. By the way they charged Rs 20 for making soup 1/2. Never heard that someone could do that. Their Chiken Kalimirch had nothing to with pepper. It was so sweet that you wouldn't need a desert. Their Mutton masala was also sweet. The Roti's and stuffed parantha's were very average. The one thing i liked was the glass of Thumps Up. The most pathetic place in Bangalore for Punjabi Food. Disgrace to the spirit of Punjabi Food."
4.0,"I didn't have an idea about an outlet of The Punjabi Rasoi in Indiranagar. It was one fine evening after work when we happened to visit Indiranagar and we were craving for some Punjabi khaana. That's when we got to know about this outlet. This outlet is certainly better in terms of ambience in comparison to it's HSR counterpart.  While in The Punjabi Rasoi, the two signature items for me are their chicken chaat and their Mango lassi !! Absolutely delectant !! I also love their Chicken malamaal and kadhai chicken. We were lucky enough to get a place as this place is always packed even on a weekday.  The service is good too. And yes, when in Indiranagar and you crave for some delicious Punjabi food, you should drop in to this place.                                                                 thefatummy.wordpress.com"
2.0,"The food was good, soft and delicious. However, the service provided for the delivery was awful. I was charged Rs 10 per paper plate (the plates were as average as they can get) which is completely unacceptable. To add to that, there were no spoons provided along with the delivery and the order delivered was incomplete."
4.0,"Great food, with great service. Have been there with friends for quite a few times. Enjoyed the food each time going out there.  I am Veggie but my friends have taken Non-Veg also there and from there responses i can tell that they have great taste for non veg also."
4.5,"Awesome Punjabi food, butter & paneer combined with great service & warm ambience are the strength of this place  Soft as butter is what comes to mind when any delicacy melts into mouth. If you're a vegetarian & have problem eating veg food coming from veg & non veg kitchen, then this is not the place for you. We didn't have issues with that, so the food took us to heaven.  Though we were already full, we were still able to have 2 butter kulcha with 3-4 veg side dishes & paneer tikkas our stomach didn't feel heavy or uncomfortable. I think most of it attributes to the quality ingredients being used. Also, this restaurant has sufficient menu items for vegetarians as much as available for non vegetarians too.  All said, yes at next opportunity, we will still visit this place to try other veg delicacies  Credit cards accepted & service tax levied at 5.83% on food"
3.5,"We went to this place on Sunday for dinner & it was pretty packed, since we didnt have a reservation we had to wait for a while.The interior on top floor is good with grape vines on the ceiling but the music didnt go with the ambience.  Anyways, for dinner we ordered couple of items - Paneer Achaari; Chicken Malai Tikka; Butter Chicken; Dal Tadka; Missi Parantha; Butter Kulcha; Sweet Punjabi Lassi & Butter Milk, all were good & the quantity was sufficient for 4.   Paneer Achaari was fabulous others items were fine. However, Sweet Punjabi Lassi in particular wasnt upto the mark & could have been better; it tasted like a mixture of diluted curd with sugar.  This place is good to visit & table reservation is recommended."
4.0,"Great place for authentic Punjabi food...be it veg or non-veg! Do not miss makke di roti and sarson da saag. You can eat and eat and eat, without feeling a pinch in your pocket. Also, the aam panna, jaljeera are refreshing and a good combination with the food. The ambience and interiors are not that great. Service was little slow, as we visited on a weekday and there was less crowd, so we had to easily wait for 15-20 mins till our food was served. But overall its a good place to enjoy Punjabi delicacies and for someone with a big appetite and small budget :)  Cheers!"
4.0,"A wonderful place which serves very authentic Punjabi cuisine. Both vegetarians and non-veggies have tons of choices. I have been going here past 5-6years the food remains as good as it was earlier. You must try the achari paneer, Afghani chicken, chicken malai tikka for starters. My usual order for the main course is paneer tikka masala, paneer makhni, malai kalab, dal makhni, mix vegetable. Their nans n kulchas are Always served hot and crispy.   The place gets really crowded so be prepared to wait if you go after 8.30. Also in case you eat less oil, make sure the same is mentioned at the time of placing the order."
4.5,"It was my first time at Bangalore and after a bout of shopping we came to this eatery because it's a hit with my sister and her husband. I understand it was 12th December (a Saturday) but i still didn't anticipate such a huge crowd at 10 PM. There were few other restaurants nearby but we decided to wait and eat here. The wait stretched to almost 40 minutes long but it was worth every bit as i would realize. The order was placed by my sister and included all her favorites - chicken manchow soup, chicken malai kebab, achari chicken, palak paneer and tandoori roti. I guess there was one more item but i don't remember exactly. The food was very tasty - especially the melts-in-your-mouth malai kebabs, and it didn't stay on the plates for long. If i am in the city again for a few days, will ensure to visit again."
4.0,"Punjabi Rasoi us one of the few places that serves authentic Punjabi food.  Been there thrice,  the taste has always been good.  But high on Ghee though :).  The homemade pickles is awesome.  Ambience is average,  service is a bit slow during peak timed but do visit for the taste."
4.0,I have been to this place twice and I must say taste was consistent throughout. Soup was lacking taste but starter panner achari is way better. Would surely suggest for spicy dish like Panner Hyderabadi and Paneer Kadai. Cottage cheese was very soft and savory. Service is pathetic but food quality and taste is awesome.
3.5,Make Sure you reserve your seat before you reach there!!!  Delicious food. Rotis are at the best in here. Loved the moderately spicy curries.
3.5,"We landed up in Punjabi Rasoi out of a friend's recommendation. We had heard that it's difficult to get seats here; but luckily we did not have to wait for a long time. The starters were great - Achari chicken tikka and Chicken Malai tikka. The achari tikka had an amazing punch of spices.. a bit on the hotter side. The Malai tikka was milder.. chicken pieces smeared in dollops of malai -tastewise quite different from chicken reshmi kebab. In the mains, we had Mutton Rogan josh, Dal Tadka and Makki ki Roti. The Mutton Rogan josh was a rich flavourful gravy..but the mutton pieces were not very tender. The dal tadka was very thick..the tadka did not add any taste to it at all. The Lassi was very average and it was not even served chilled, as expected. But overall, a good meal in a budget. would like to come back here for more."
5.0,"When it comes to North-Indian food in Bangalore, this restaurant is a family favourite of ours. Their portions are big, food is yummy and menu is extensive. All their kebabs are to-die-for, but my personal favourite is the Afghani Chicken and the Hariyali Chicken kebabs. The breads are soft and well-made and their wide range of curries makes it difficult to choose from. Be it for a dinner date out or a nice, home-delivered dinner on the couch, Punjabi Rasoi always tops our list."
4.5,"This is a must visit place in Bangalore if you enjoy Punjabi food. Authentic cuisine with exceptional service. The staff is great with the menu and they are prompt with anything you ask for. 3 of us had a scrumptious meal wherein we ordered two starters, two main course dishes and various breads. Unlike any other indian place, the gravies of both the dishes we ordered were different-paneer butter masala and veg kofta, and not to mention yummy. The veg seekh kebab and mushroom tikka were also great with their green chutney. The naan, kulcha, stuffed kulcha and phulkas were amazing too. We also had jaljeera and aam panna for drinks-no complaints there either. To top it all, it just cost us under 1.2k for all this! Worth every penny I must say. Definitely recommend. Must visit. About the ambience, it's quite pleasant with a few quirky walls. You won't have the opportunity to look at the surroundings when the foods at your table! Delicious!"
4.5,"Best Punjabi food in town, period. This is on my top 5 restaurant's list in Bangalore. They have a huge spread. Amazing food, which starts from paneer tikka, nargisi chicken, tangri kebab, kalmi kebab (one of my favorites). For the main course, I would suggest navratan korma, methi malai paneer, chicken lababdar, chicken nagada to name a few. Don't forget to try the lassi as well. If you love punjabi dishes, this is the place to be in Bangalore. Advisable to go in groups so that you can order multiple dishes and try. :D Highly recommend."
3.5,"My colleagues have been ordering from Punjabi Rasoi for a long time. The food is delivered on time, Rotis are soft even though they get slightly cold through the delivery.   I also got a chance to visit this restaurant a couple of times. Tucked in one of the Indiranagar streets i.e. 2nd Main road, near the BDA complex and the Old Madras Road, Punjabi Rasoi is a nice North Indian - Punjabi restaurant. Getting a parking spot here can be a hassle.   My review is based only on the veg items I have tried during my visits here. The ambience is simple, with kites and Bollywood posters hanging by the ceiling (needs a bit of cleaning though). The seating is comfortable however it may feel a bit cramped when the place is full. There is barely any waiting area outside the restaurant.   Usually Bollywood music is played here, the plates, tumblers and the kettles used here are reminiscent of North Indian culture.   The waitstaff is a mixed bag, some of them extremely courteous while a few others carry not-bothered-attitude. Coming to the food, majority of the items we tried were delicious.  As you would expect from any North Indian / Punjabi restaurant, the rotis, phulkas are well made. Out of the paranthas, methi parantha seems to be the best of the lot as the aloo and other stuffed parantha do not have adequate stuffing.   The punjabi lassi is thick and good, but not the best in the city.   Their paneer preparations - Achari Paneer, Paneer Tikka, Paneer malaamal and Kadai Paneer are good and often reliable as the paneer used seems to be fresh and soft.   Veg Pulao is a good bet too, but the raita served with the pulao is not very appetising.  During winters, do try out their Sarson ka saag with makke ki roti.   The spiciness of the food served here is a bit on the lower side when compared to the authentic Punjabi food. Also the pricing is not on the expensive side.   Overall, it's a nice punjabi restaurant to try out on a weekday."
1.0,"The person at the counter is super rude and arrogant. It was super crowded and they were taking names for waiting list but not checking it while giving tables. When I asked the person at counter about this, he was very rude and said it's my wish how allocate tables."
4.0,"The food especially non veg was pure class. We ordered rada chicken and dal makhni with butter naan. They made it possible for us to enjoy very high quality north indian food in bangalore. And the lassi was so thick, I was finding it difficult to suck using straw."
4.0,"Very hearty food,  quantity of main course was decent,  starters quantity could be increased. Good for eating out for non-occasions... They make liberal use of butter n paneer in all their dishes so weight watchers keepnaway"
5.0,"My review is based on NV point of view. Veggies please excuse me. I have been here several times plus the HSR branch. This has been always a top choice for me and guys they have never disappointed me.  Two starters which I always munch in are Achari chicken and Chicken Chat. If you are spice geek then don't miss this. Do try the lahsuni chicken, I tried it first time today and guys it was so yummy.  The do have a list of today's special, do scan over it and order with inquiries from staffs, if you are having any confusion.  I do suggest before order anything please query about the type of menu items and quantity. Generally, for full plate starters there are thumping 12 pieces to eat, so order wisely and don't waste food :)  Indian breads are also top class, specially the Makki Ki Roti, a must try.  Finally, the VFM, for 3 starters, 2 NV gravy items, 1 dessert and 8 breads, I paid just 1400 INR. Hence, VFM is totally justified.  Happy Dining!!!!!!!"
3.0,Good restaurant with a punjabi twist. Has a good punjabi theme and flavour to it. Situated in indiranagar near to 100ft this place is always packed even with so much space. We got table in the terrace section which was quite good.  Our order  1. Baby corn tandoori - good tandoori flavour. 2. Veg seek kabab- liked the way it was stuffed. 3. Mix veg - good fusion of spices and vegetables. 4. Aloo mutter - regular and original taste.  A bit less quantity for the starters but overall a good place to eat and enjoy with friends and family.
4.5,After trying so many options..  This is the most reliable option I found for North Indian cuisine.. Online delivery is also fine ..  Overall it's good for veg and non-veg food..  Too good for hard core punjabi lovers! Only one problem minimum delivery limit is 350.. I can not order when I am alone..  They charge  extra in such cases but atleast deliver..
4.5,Awesome food...delicious taste....malai kofta is just awesome and so is the mutton fried rice...and last but not the least lassi is just wow
3.5,food is really good.  Waiting time is long  though.  Main course is just too good. Starters are average. Service is good. Please don't order dessert!
5.0,"The best Punjabi food in Bengaluru. I tried butter chicken, dal makhani and mango lassi. Would definitely visit again and would recommend to anyone looking for authentic Punjabi food"
1.0,"Always been a regular at this joint, enjoyed their food. Ordered food from them last night for more than 2000 bucks.. Today just decided to head there to pick up some breads and they refused! We were told that we won't serve you just breads, you need to buy something from us. Never heard of such a ridiculous policy! They need to learn a thing or two about customer service and not fleecing their customers!"
4.0,Good authentic punjabi food...  Taste.. Flavour all was too good... That also in such a economical budget.. Only service was slow... They should work on that as the waiting likhne was V. Long ...Love to go again and again
1.5,"Some brutally honest things are going to be said now..  Possibly the worst north Indian restaurant in Indiranagar. I walked in with colleagues after checking good reviews about it on Zomato. But right from ordering the food till getting the finger bowl these people only disappointed us.  1. The waiter looked least bothered about taking our order.  2. We ordered Kandhari Chicken in starters. Waiter came with a dish calling it Chicken Kalmi. We said this isn't what we ordered. So his manager came back with same dish saying this is Kandhari chicken.  3. We ordered biryani, curry and naan in main course. This was the most tasteless biryani I ever had. Did guys even heard about spices? Even the vegetarian dishes we had had no taste to it.  4. Drinks we ordered, appeared after the main course was served. I dont understand what it took so long to prepare Lime soda.  5. And offcourse the International  ViSa card didn't work.   Probably the only thing I liked was the mouth freshener. I ate it twice.  So either the rating they have on zomato are faked or their entire system just collapsed under heavy load of customers.  So to all those planning to go here.. Below are the things you should think on..  Bad service, Bad food,  Bad Music.. N also there is a diehard fan of Honey singh n Himesh Reshmiyya sitting in their staff.."
4.5,"Most of the punjabi places in indiranagar are good but the punjabi rasoi has always been there in the list of my favourite places in indiranagar. The taste of the food ever since I have been having here has never changed. I've have always loved to have less spicy food and the food ordered here has always been customised and made to my expectations. I just love the lassi and paneer dishes at this place. The overall experience with food, service has been excellent and the pricing also is pretty practical."
3.5,This is a pocket-friendly place with tasty food. We ordered the Tandoori babycorn which was quite delicious. For the main course we ordered makki roti and sarson da saag in true punjabi style. Both the items tasted good but the rotis were not warm enough. We had to remind the waiters a couple of times for our roti orders. The service was a little lackadaisical and hence the delay in getting warm rotis. It is a regular decent place with a good ambience. Food and ambience: 3.5/5Service: 3/5
4.5,One our favorite Punjabi food place. The taste has been consistent and the flavors excellent.Undoubtedly the best paneer we have ever eaten. Vegetarians must try their chatpata paneer options and also definitely should not miss their Tandoori Gobi!
4.5,Pocket friendly with awesome food but ambience nothing great... My favourite dish is the chicken chat and chicken achari... Their parantha s  are awesome...
4.0,Ambience is really good. Vary calm and pleasant. Had ordered veg platter.  It was good. Paneer served here is really good. it just melts in your mouth .Its a must to visit for vegetarians.
4.5,A regular at this place.both their indirinagar and hsr branch.Prefer the indiranagar one . Paneer malamaal and soya roti thats always my order here
3.5,"Authentic punjabi cuisine, although little spicy but to neutralize the effect take a lassi(preferably mango).  Try chicken chaat and kadhai chicken. Ambience is okay a bit towards bad side, stewards are in a hurry to serve you. HSR outlet is better. thefatummy.blogspot.com"
2.0,"It was a lunch meeting.  Unexpected,  so had to choose the nearest one because of I was time pressed.   Not so great place or ambience.   But expected at least good food.   Not great either.   Too much oil and Masala even after telling them to keep it minimal.   Will not visit again for sure.   There was nothing Punjabi about this place.   The staff also were weird,  we had to sit where they told us to."
4.5,"It's food quality plus recipes in menu are awsome.iv tried mutton roganjosh,biryani,lolypop chineese style,veg pulav and stuffed aloo kulcha..all dishes are awsome..it's a bit far from my place but whenever I visit indranagar I like to have lunch or dinner in Punjabi Rasoi..I think one must go and taste the delicious dishes..."
3.5,"A nice,decent and not so fancy a restaurant. It's  a typical indian outlet where u get almost every punjabi dish. We directly jumped into main course coz we were hungry but we still ordered masala papad which was okayish and lassi alongside which was good. For the main course we thought of trying veg for the first time so we ordered dal makhani and paneer tikka masala which was decent enough like nothing tasted never before and alongside all the rotis and parathas and lulcha we had chicken and mutton stuffed parathas although the disappointing thing was the lack of sufficient stuffing in them. All in all i would say it is a simple restaurant and if you are thinking of trying nothing fancy. A one time eatable i would say."
2.0,"Disappointing!!!!visited twice, once tried veg n other time non veg..both instances,starters were served lukewarm having no taste..and you don't even realize that you have just started having starters n main course is served for you..don't understand why they are always in such rush as if they gonna miss Mumbai local train :) didn't find any difference between veg n non veg curries ordered during both visits..think they prepare reddish curry in bulk and use it for every main course dish..when asked for curry suggestions,during both visits they suggested reddish curry having ordinary taste. First floor seating is much better than ground floor.ground floor ambience is depressing...had much hopes for authentic Punjabi dishes,but both visits :("
4.0,"If you are looking for authentic North Indian fare at affordable rates, this is the place to go. We have tried both veg and nonveg dishes and they have never disappointed us. Paneer achari is d best veg starter they have and is a must have. Chicken Punjabi was amazing and perfectly spiced! Service is good and ambience is also quite ok. Never tried the desserts though, but considering their record, I do not think this place would disappoint..."
3.5,"Can't go wrong. This is the place I visit when I don't wanna try anything new. The ambiance is tacky, but they have terrace seating now, which is kinda nice. The starters are just good nothing great except for the achari chicken. The main course is decent. The pricing is very competitive. 700 for two. Caution: Too much essence in mango lassi may spoil your experience, don't order it."
1.0,"Trying most of their both Veg and Non Veg starters not even a single item is good compared to HSR branch and worst service ever, served with stale paneer.  They don't even have curd atleast.  Worst hotel I've ever visited"
3.5,"Quiet  an avg food, ambience and service.  Personally I think this place is good for a quick bite on a working day for offices situated in the vicinity."
5.0,"This is my fav place for the kababs, butter chicken and all kinds of starters. I love the food here and order it almost every Friday. A must try if you haven't tried the food from this place. Ambience is okay. But if you just want to relish on the food and do not care about the ambience definetly a place that you must visit soon"
1.0,"Got a cockroach in my kalmi kebab! disgusted!! This used to be my go to place for some good dal makhani. After ages, we decided to go to this place!  Our standard order as a starter was a kalmi kebab. we ordered that +naan+dal makhni... I found a dead cockroach in the kalmi kebab that was served on my plate. It was a huge disappointment for me. I really liked the place and have visited 2-3 times. But there is no going back from now! The manager said he would change the dish, but the damage had been done. You need to have certain amount of hygiene in a restaurant and food you serve, and this is completely unacceptable. I walked out of the hotel and will never return!  To the staff - please ensure you double check on hygiene. Stop giving unprofessional and inexperienced replies such as ""ye kaise ho saktha hai"" when i'm showing you the plate with the cockroach in it! Wish you the very best!"
4.0,Crowded place even on weekdays directly indicating the popularity of the place. Fish Amritsari and mango lassi were too good. A perfect place if you wanna have north Indian food.
5.0,The best Punjabi food I had. Malai kofta is a must order...it just melts in your mouth. They have lot of variety in roti and paranthas too. Must visit!
3.5,"Value for money. Flavorful food with fine ambience. The service is not up to the mark (they served the main course to me and forgot about the starters I had ordered. On top of that, the server was extremely unapologetic for doing that!). Food servings are generous. Its location is such that you can easily miss it."
4.0,"This is a no frills restaurant, which offers value for money. Very courteous staff too. The best dish I like is their 'Chicken Thangri Kabab'. Best taste ever!"
3.5,Gud... One thing I felt a lil hesitant was there are no dry items available... Other Dan dat everything was fine and gud.. We ordered dum aaloo veg kofta mango lassi plain lassi and 6 rotis.. Total bill was 781... Was ok ok wth bill.. Nice interiors n gud... Thalis wud have been added in the menu... Which wud make it full...                                                                  sakhiravoor.wordpress.com
4.0,"Haven't visited the restaurant still. But, got the food home delivered from Punjabi rasoi. The food didn't disappoint me even a bit. For starters, I ordered BABYCORN TANDOORI which is a must try. At many of the places, babycorn starters are a little bland. But, this one had got it all. It was finger licking delicious. For main course , I ordered MUSHROOM MASALA and BUTTER KULCHA. MUSHROOM MASALA was a little oily but had the perfect taste. Even the kulchas were pretty good. If you are craving for a perfect north Indian dish. This place would be a good option to try."
4.0,"Good food. Like. For the money  the portions are good and the taste is amazing. The service has improved over time.  Previous experience was bad, but no complaints this time!  Take the malai kofta and pair it with a butter kulcha. Yum. :)"
3.5,This is a good place for dinner for family and for late evening/ dinner meetings. They have a good selection of vegetarian food options. The service is good and food is good. Worth trying out if in this region of bangalore.
4.5,"This review is just based on the home delivery I got for lunch . we got the food in  50 mins. We ordered baby corn tandoori, mushroom Masala and tandoori roti. Babycorn was cooked so well. Tandoori flavour and coated Masala on babycorn was perfect. Loved the gravy of Mushroom kadai. There was lots of mushrooms in the gravy. Roti was still soft even though it had become Lil cold.   Definitely visiting the place again."
4.0,This place is hidden in the streets of indira nagar .Excellent service and very responsive staff . Nice ambiance and coming to food they give generous portions of food .The paneer tasted fresh and very soft. Totally value for money . Must visit this place if you're looking for good punjabi food in bangalore.
2.5,"Had been to this place for my bday party. Staff gets pretty confused with a large group stepping in. Coming to food.. it's not at all mention worthy.. vegetarians better avoid this place, chicken preparations were okayish.. nothing great. Honestly the best thing I found was their ""raita"" served with d okayish biriyani."
4.0,Tasty punjabi food ......dere is no better destination than dis place. Tandoori chicken and tandoori lollipops are amazing here.....dese are just a few names out of a big menu dey have to offer. Been here a couple of tym and will definitely visit it again....:)
4.0,"Ambience s pretty decent! They say air-conditioned restaurant but turned on the fans. Food s brilliant the essence of Punjab s there, lassi, haryali tikka, fish tikka, lasooni tikka was really good  My fav s garlic naan, phulka and methi parantha. Malamaal s a very nice gravy to choose I loved it. A nice family restaurant Thaidul Islam"
4.5,"The first thing you will notice after placing your order here is OMG! how fast is their service. Ambiance is ok,not great though the paneer is absolute YUM!!! Recently, tried the Kadhai Paneer and I must say, its lip smacking(Paneer Butter Masala is my favorite though :D) Best meal.Wanted to lick the plate clean :D  Ambiance: 3/5 Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4.5/5"
4.0,"Well,the place looks quite small for a well known restaurant. But there is no compromise with the taste of the food served. I went here for the first time,but loved the well set place with a good taste to offer."
3.0,Very poor ambience and too crowded place. Service is also not that great. Ordered four naan which they gave in three installment. Fully disappointed with the service but only thing which we liked is the food. Food is very tasty as expected :)
5.0,Awesome Punjabi food actually heaven for north Indian Punjabi food lovers try malamaal chicken and veg kofta and daal these are awesome and spicy. Cost is also a cherry on the top cause as compair to some of other expensive restaurants
4.0,"Good food, better service and a decent price. Has nothing to floor you in terms of its variety and uniqueness,  but satisfies all your basic expectations in terms of taste and quality of food."
3.5,"We went to this restaurant for a team lunch. Some chicken starters were good and rest of the things were average. Place is spacious, ambience is good and prices are reasonable."
4.5,The experience in this restaurant was very nice. Foods were very delicious priced very reasonably. Twice  I had been here and in both the occasions i had jeera rice and chicken curry which i liked very much.  The best part of the restaurant is it has got a roof top dining. So if you visit here for dinner prefer the rooftop.
4.0,Craving for some North Indian food led me to this place. Absolutely loved it. Great service. Food game was on point and didn't disappoint at all. Don't think I have anything really bad to say about them. Or anything on the cons side. Just was a very satisfied customer.
4.5,"Amazing! Lipsmacking!! Delectable!!!  I have been to this place quite a few times and the food here is really great. Someone(read me :P) has rightly said that a good Punjabi restaurant's signature food underlies in is its Sirka Wala Pyaaz (marinated onions) with pudina chutney & Lassi and gladly the restaurant scores a perfect 10 on both the parameters.  The veg starters spl. Paneer Shashlik(grilled panner and pineapple starter) and veg seekh kababs were simply mouth watering. Speaking of main course, they had one of the best Paneer Tikka Masala and Paneer Punjabi in bangalore. The mali kofta and dal makhani also went hand in hand with the soft lachha paranthas and naans.  The revamped look of this place is great..The second floor with its Bollywood theme kept us engrossed till the food was served. With a real nice roof top seating and soothing music, this place has earned its own rappo. And did I mention the water sprinkler coolers over there. Kasam se Delhi ki tent wali shaadiyaan yaad aa gyi (made us remember marriages in Delhi ;) )  To sum it up a great place to hangout with family or foodie friends with a great Ambiance- 4.0, Food- 4.5.  P.S. They are charging every extra bowl of Chutney!! Seriously??? Is it for everyone or just us(because we ate too muchhh..??? P.P.S. Don't miss out to grab a pan of your choice from jus outside the restaurant."
3.5,"A nice Punjabi Restaurent just around the Indiranagar BDA complex. I like the vegetarian food here, especially their paneer items. I guess the paneer here is prepared in house as ive not found many restaurants in bangalore that serve the typical soft north indian (Delhi) paneer. This plc is not very heavy on the wallet and a veg meal for 2 would cost around 500."
4.0,"As mentioned by others in their reviews, paneer items are really worth trying. Paneer is very soft. Also the next best thing was thick lassi. I really enjoyed it.  Overall the veg food was very good. The ambience of the place gets extra points. But the masala papad was a bit spicy."
4.5,Delicious food! Polite and good service. Decent ambiance. Quantity too is quite good. Value for money. Not that expensive. Definitely a must visit.
3.5,"Went for a lunch on a Saturday. Had high expectations from the place as it is one of the highly rated places in Indiranagar for North Indian food.  In terms of ambience the terrace is good. For lunch we ordered veg seekh kabab which was good, dal makhani was good again. The bhindi had an odd taste and was too oily. The breads were also good. Chanch and kheer were ordinary.  The service was not good .Orders took lot of time , couple of times the waiter bought wrong order which further increased the time the actual order took. Imli restaurant nearby and tandoori taal are probably better."
2.0,"Heard about it from one of my friend and been there on a weekend. But our experience was not so good, especially, I didn't like the person, who was on counter, he was quite arrogant and arguing with one of my friend. Food was just fine nothing special. I don't why so much buzz about it. Ambience, roof is decorated with different kind of kites and dinning area was quite congested."
3.5,Ahha !! Opened by Faridabad native to bring in proper punjabi environment along with awesome taste of all items served there.  A must for all north indians in bangalore
5.0,food was yummy.We loved the chicken chaat in the starters & aam panna was very refreshing.The only disappointment was that we wanted to try some boneless starter but they said its not available.Hope its available next time would love to try few more stuff.Ambience is awesome.Value for money.
5.0,"My favourate place to eat in Bangalore. I can eat here anytime any day. There is nothing wrond with the food, ambience, service. Why 5 stars? I could not find a flaw at the place and also it has the perfect and yummiest food in Bangalore. Nothing more required. :)  PS: Try Chur Chur Naam, i dont remember eating any other Indian bred since the first time i had this."
1.5,"Came here for a bday treat.nice place for a group of friendz to sit and chat for a long time.But food especially veg was not dat great veg sheek kebab and mushroom tikka was very bad.paneer tikka was good.Main course were ok ok types.Same wid nonveg not dat great.The waiters wer very confused.Very late service.Only plus point was the lassi and raitha it was yummy.And price were reasonable , but food could have been better.Sampita Maitra"
3.5,"Brilliant food...makes you want to eat more than you can eat...not at all expensive, order for two if you're three because the quantity is quite good...one minus - extremely understaffed"
4.5,"Awesome tasty food. Good for your pockets too. Non-veg junta should visit here. Only bad thing they don't serve alcohol :(, at least they should give beer to digest their food. :) ... But overall good place to visit with nice ambience."
5.0,"I have been der for 2 tyms n loved d food. One f d bst punjabi restaurant in bangalore. Ambience is good, staff is also good. Quick service and great food. Both tym went in a big group and tasted many veg and non veg items. Food is delicious , mouth watering, succulent chicken, curries r fabulous. Exact amount f spices r der in each dish. Just loved it!!! Must try- chicken lahsuni tikka. Sadly i dint click ne photos coz v wer sooo busy eating... Every foodie who loves punjabi cuisine must go to dis restaurant.  :-)"
5.0,"Awesome Punjabi food..the perfect taste and amazing place...punjaab di yaad aa gaye..we ate the paneer, it was so soft. Couldn't find such pander anywhere in bangalore."
4.5,"Just loved it :)  We ordered veg foods and it was very nice.  5 rating to Paneer achari starter, their pickle sauce is unique and the paneer was so soft.  Roti and gravy was also too good.  Definitely worth for price!!"
4.0,"Our go-to place for some great North-indian comfort food. Have tried out their veg and chicken soups, Paneer achari, almost all of the chicken starters, mind-blowing Aam panna and lassi, and their main courses. Almost everything is perfect. Specially recommended are the Lasooni Tikka, Paneer Achari, Aam Panna, Lassi, Paneer Malamaal, Dal Tadka, Chicken Kalimirch and Keema Paratha. And yeah, don't forget to have a Calcutta meetha Paan from the guy outside !! :D"
3.5,I have been to this restaurant many times. It offers proper authentic North Indian Punjabi food. Sarson ka saag and Kadhai Paneer are great options for vegeterians. Price is very genuine for the quality they serve. A must try for all punjabi food lovers.
4.5,"Excellent food with a good ambience. Though the service needs improvement. We ordered our first course, though the soups were served in the first 15 mins - the starters took another half an hour to come through. The main course on the other hand, arrived relatively fast. The paneer is to die for - all the paneer based subzis . The chicken was cooked well. I would not suggest you to order tandoori starters .... a little excess of masala."
1.0,"We ordered a home delivery from the restaurant, the food was late and incomplete. The owner calls and is arrogant that they didn't bill for the missing items so it should be fine. Would not recommend ordering from this place on a weekend."
4.0,Delicious food. Ambiance is good.. nothing great but the food is really value for money. Went there twice in last one month and was delighted with the quality of food on both occasion. Definitely worth a visit for North Indian cuisine especially Punjabi.
4.5,"Delicious,affordable and delectable. Afghani tandoor is a must try.one of the few decent north indian restaurants in Indiranagar that is truly Punjabi in nature ."
4.5,Just luv the fud @ this place..think its the only place where I can go to hav gud punjabi fud nd not b disappointed at any point f tym....although I cannot say the same for there other franchise..
4.5,"If u r a foodie and u love North Indian cuisine this is the place for you! I have visited this place many times n still counting! Pick any dish u want, u wont b disappointed! Chilly paneer dal tadka n zeera rice are my personal favorites here though i have tried almost everything here. Ambience is average. Service is lil slow at times due to too many guests which also makes the place lil congested . But the staff is cheerful. Portions are large enough."
4.0,Actually my cousin took me to this place long back....after that I visited this place more than 6 times.I like chicken afghani and chicken sheekh kebab as starters and in main course specially chicken kadai and dal makhani and atlast must try their lassi....ambience ok ok type....
4.0,"Well .. Is you are a foodie .. This is one place you should not miss.. Decent ambience, not expensive, not so good service but incredible food !! Have been there 2-3 times and this place has always made me belt food. Definitely worth visit.. Must go"
4.0,"This place has been on my list for a long time now, having tasted their food on late nights spent at office. Their rooftop is so serene and can easily turn into a romantic place with the right kind of weather in the evening. Their cutlery gives you the rustic feel of Punjab.  We ordered chicken kandhahari for starters and it was the right amount succulent and marinated perfectly. Their lassis are good, but I've had better elsewhere. For the main course it was a lot of different kinds of roti, Chicken Lababdar and Mutton Rada. The Chicken Lababdar wasn't up to my expectations as I've had their Chicken Punjabi before and that was done to perfection. Mutton Rada was different with a gravy of keema and mutton. Their Veg Kofta is one of the best koftas I have had till now. We ordered Rice Kheer for desserts. It was mediocre. Nothing to write home about. Coming to few of the things I didn't like here. My friend ordered Lacha Paranthas and they weren't done well. We were a group of 8 people, and the water jug kept getting empty and the waiters had to be summoned every time to fill it up.  I would definitely want to go back again and try all the other things on their menu.                                             seekingthatperfectlife.com"
3.5,"A nice, pocket friendly punjabi eatery with decent food. The service is prompt and the food preparations are in the traditional Punjabi Bhunao style . The starters are decent delights, the Indian breads were good enough. The quantity per dish is enough for two. Ambience: 3/5 Food: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5"
4.5,"This place is worth visiting if someone is missing good North food in bangalore.  Awesome taste, average ambience, fair price of food, I love paneer gravy, veg kofta and amritsari Kulcha, and aam panna"
3.0,"Food is good.  Ambience wise also fine. But they are very late is service. It s not that they do it intentionally, the place is over crowded during weekends. Hence be prepared to wait for your order."
1.0,There is only one word for this restaurant is WORST.. First they keep customer waiting for 45 mins and when customer asks for food they say THERE IS NO BUFFET SYSTEM. YOU HAVE TO WAIT.. IF YOU WANT TO WAIT THEN SIT OTHERWISE LEAVE.. After this if customer replys back then they say YOU ARE NOT EDUCATED.. if they are running a service business they should know how to respect their customer rather than showing their arrogance.. At last I would only say WALK IN AT YOUR OWN RISK..
4.0,"Great place to enjoy Punjabi food. Ambience is decent but not overly fancy. Daal makhni, chicken in lababdar, achari and Afghani versions along with many mutton dishes are all recommended."
4.0,the place is nice and good ambiance. the food is very tasty but bit spicy. service is also good. must visit place. price is decent not expensive.
3.0,The only good thing I liked about the place was their paneer preparations. The quality of paneer was so fresh that it could just melt in your mouth. The chicken preparations were very rich and spicy but had a good taste.
3.5,Restaurant is located near by BDA complex in indranagar. Nice seating and good ambience with a great tasting food. Anyone who is looking for north Indian food must try here. Staff is quick and polite.
4.0,"This is a nice place hidden off Old Madras Road near BDA Complex, where all the private travels are located.  The Ambience is decent but the food here is a killer. We ordered both Veg and Non veg starters and main course options. The Tangdi Kabab and Butter Chicken were finger licking while the Veg option was too oily and didn't quite like it."
5.0,Super Fantastic Fabulous place .. Mast Punjabi food .. We ordered Punjabi Chicken and it was heaven :) Lajawab paneer tasted so good .. :) I just loved this place .. This place is good for those who like spicy food and who doesn't mind little extra oil around the plate .. Maze aa gaye :)
4.0,"Although the place hides out a little among small stores on the street, once found, its a trove of authentic Punjabi flavor - or I hope I tasted it right this time. The Lassi might fill you up just a little bit more than you would like, and so you might want to opt for the buttermilk. The chicken is an absolute wonder especially when combined with Bajra roti's touched with ghee... It's a great family place... only thing is, its a little hard to find if you haven't seen it before..."
3.5,"Somehow I am fine with the food, but not as good as expected. Preparations are very oily, they really needs to take care about it. Though I liked the mango Lassi and would like to visit the place repeatedly."
3.5,"Authentic Punjabi food. The place is okay. Paintings on the walls are big plus. Food variety is good. Service is very fast. Never made to wait for the food for long time. Overall good experience. Pricings are not economical, and not costly too.. For Punjabi food lovers good place to try authentic Punjabi dishes!"
3.0,Ambience: Good Luxury: Average Food: Good Variety: Average Hospitality: Average  Service: Good Music: Good Lighting: Bright Price: Fairly Expensive  Worth: Definitely for Paneer stuffed Naan
4.0,"Go here for the real Punjabi stuff. We stuffed ourselves with gobhi tandoori, hariyali kabab, paneer achaari, sarson da saag, roti and naans, and topped these up with lassi for good measure. You can imagine what a meal it was. By the time we were through, we were drooping from the sheer volume of the intake. Every dish was good, thought a trifle overpriced. Still, taste trumps everything else here.  Service is just a little slow, but the food is worth the wait."
5.0,Get ready for some authentic Punjabi food. It cannot get better. We went there for a birthday treat and it was the best ever. Their afghani chicken is heavenly(hi5 for chicken lovers!). My personal favorite is Dal Tadka. Yumm!! After that visit I have been there frequently and every time the food was delicious.
3.5,"The place is always crowded so u can make out the popularity. Food is authentic Punjabi/ north Indian unlike most of other north Indian joints who has south Indian flavored dishes. Tandoori chicken very tasty. Paneer tikka awesome. Amritsari fish they call it speciality but I think it's better to avoid. Just a tomoto based gravy which does not suit the fish.  Service is good. Ambiance- just OK. Pricing , for taste is fine as they use ghee based cooking but for that ambiance its costly. Overall a good experience."
1.0,Food is typically Punjabi and hence nothing special but owners are partial in providing seats. We're made to wait while guests who came after were provided seats.
2.5,"I was a great fan of this place. I used to visit it often 1 year back. After a long gap i visited this restaurant last sunday for lunch and I found so much difference in food and service.  1. Service has become VERY bad! 2. DONT EVER HAVE MUTTON BIRYANI HERE. - probably my mistake ordering biryani here but but the mutton biryani that I got here was the worst biryani I've ever had in my life. 3. The butter chicken which i used to love, was so much more diluted and was't that great at all!!"
1.0,"Waiter was very unhelping and unpleasant. We ordered for Kalmi Kebab, and they served something that we've never seen before, which was definitely not Kalmi. The waiter argued that that's how they made Kalmi, and that there was nothing they would do about it. They didn't even mention the difference in the menu.  It was a very unpleasant experience. Never going back again."
4.0,Heard about this for its Punjabi nd north Indian cuisine .. Definitely a must try place.. However ambiance is average as the interior is a bit congested. Food was good especially the paneer Hyderabadi and veg kofte. Dont miss the sarso ka saag with makke di roti combination.   Next I would try out there online delivery options. ;)  Overall rating  Food 4.5/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Value for money : 4/5
4.0,Even though I'm not a huge fan of a lot of dishes at this place. I do call & recommend them for home delivery Indian food ( they take a long time to deliver) especially this particular chicken main course called ' Chicken Lababdar' ( boneless) which is heaven on earth :))
3.5,Good place for authentic Punjabi food.  Especially their Sarno da saag and makke do roti.  Quantity can be improved though. Overall a good place for family dinner.
3.5,Visited yesterday. Location is great. But too congested. Besides staffs were not so friendly. Very tough to find a place. I didn't find any dish as mouthwatering as other outlets of the same chain. Price was okay. Even the quality of the food was also somewhat okay. But service is pathetic. I will rethink before visiting this place again.
4.0,"Visited this place for a quick lunch with a friend and wasn't disappointed at all. We ordered Lasooni Tikka, Punjabi Paneer, Garlic Naan and of course lassi. Loved the tikka. It had a creamy texture, not too spicy and yet full of flavour. The paneer was so soft that it almost melts in your mouth. Lassi was average. Overall, a good Punjabi experience!"
4.0,"Definitely a must try place. Closest to Delhi butter chicken experience. Their portions are just right and suit a smaller group too. Parking in the area is a challenge. Service a a bit slow, but the food makes up for it.    The dal Amritsar and butter chicken are must try's. Go for it!"
2.5,"Surprised tosee the rating and reputation this place holds, compared to my otherwise disappointing experience here.  The ambience is average with misfitting props and hangings, the furniture placement is good with a child-friendly environment. The staff is hospitable and patient with the confused patrons while they place their orders.  Unfortunately, the food was depressing. If you are one with the taste buds for appetisers I'd suggest avoiding the soups, you might just end up questioning your entire life's understanding of soups. A few veg starters were great, the rest were just okay. The one chicken starter,Nargissi Tikka was under marinated and felt slightly undercooked as well.  The inappreciable and confused expression on my Punjabi friends faces clearly told me how good the lassi's were. The veg main courses felt like I was in Gujrati Rasorouand couldn't believe that I was eating the over sweetened curries in at a Punjabi place. The only thing that everyone with me enjoyed unanimously were the variety of Indianbreads this place served, they were delicious.  After learning that half the deserts listed weren't available, then I turned my attention to the bill. Yes, Indranagar is an expensive area it's a well-established fact, but I'm sorry Punjabi Rasoi for the portions and the servings you offer and what you charge for them needs a serious rework."
3.5,"The Ambiance was okayish , as I felt they tried too much to decorate on the small place, too many kites, spider man and many more items hanging from top.  Now coming to the food, its awesome. I tried fish gravies and Kababs and Chicken gravy and that's pretty good. price was quiet descent as per the location."
4.0,"I've been ordering from Punjabi Rasoi and eating at their outlet for about 4 years now. It is one of the better places to have north indian cuisine. Their yellow dal and palak paneer is to die for. The chicken lababdar is also one of my favorites, however for about a year, i was on a diet of their dal makhni and gobhi matar masala...and that is where i put on about 5-6 kgs....and thats why i'm giving them a rating of 4 not 5....the food is yummy but a little too rich and oily for the health conscious....but what needs to be remebered is that, their food is yummy...and at the end, thats all that matters..!! (*burps)"
1.0,"Punjabi rasoi has lost the earlier taste I'm disappointed  I been there few years back ,then the taste was good. But this time I was disappointed,average ambience,food was average,I ordered tawa chicken it was not good  I was disappointed"
5.0,"Bingo! This is the best value-for-money restaurant serving authentic Punjabi cuisine, and the restaurant hits the sweet spot in all aspects, be it the service, ambiance, or quality of the food.  Locating the restaurant was not that difficult with Google Maps there to help always. Parking can be a bit tricky since one has to park his/her vehicle in the road next to the restaurant building.  All the items we ordered were extremely good. Tomato Soup was excellent, with the perfect blend of thickness and butter. For starters, we had Peshawari Paneer Tikka and Allo Bharwan. Although we had an overdose of Paneer, we never felt so. We had Butter Paneer Masala for the main course, and it was the best I had till date.  Order any item from here, you can never go wrong. A must try restaurant.  Note: Ask for roof-top dining. It is much better than in-door seating arrangement.  Ambiance: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 Quality: 5/5"
3.5,90's Bollywood music false ceiling with hanging garden setup made for an average ambience. Good Punjabi food. Sarsong ka saag and methi parathas were awesome. Tangri Kabab was finger licking delicious. For the price food was definitely worth. Good restaurant for Punjabi food.
4.5,"After lots of thoughts, we finalized our destination to Punjabi Rasoi. Indirangar could be considered as foodies' paradise, and yes we did not feel regret about our decision. We had a great experience here.  Situated at Indiranagar 2nd main road. This is at the first floor of a building. If you are going towards 100 feet road, you will find this on your right hand side.  ---------------------------------------------------x------------------------------------x------------------------ Ambiance:  This place is nicely decorated, and the ambiance is quite sober. The plates, glass etc. had a touch of North Indian culture. The ceiling was decorated with different colours kites. When we reached the place, it was almost empty, but when we left the place, it was full. We had lots of options to choose our table, and decided to take a seat near the glass wall, so we also got a view of the street. Played Hindi songs on the background. The sound was not too loud, so we could chat with each other and take the pleasure of the food together.  Rating: 4/5  Service:  Service was also great. The guy who served us was very polite and well mannered, and also helped us to choose our dishes. Foods were served at regular interval, so there was no delay between any two consecutive meal courses. They had the courtesy to serve on your dish. They also gave us the finger bowl after the food. Only negative point was that they did not serve drinking water to our glasses. We had to take it from the jar.  Rating: 4.5/5  Cost-Quantity-Quality:  Food items were fresh. Portion of the dishes were quite good. They also serve half portion for most of the chicken dishes. Cost was also very reasonable according to the quality and quantity of the items. For two the cost is around 900. Accepts both card and cash. I think they also accept the payment through MOMOS, a newly launched mobile app.  Rating: 4.5/5  Food:  Most of the food items which we tried, were delicious and strongly recommended.  We ordered achari chicken, butter kulcha, keema parantha (mutton), pudina parantha, dal makhni, chicken lababdar (boneless), masala rice, veg pulao, Punjabi lassi and mitha paan.  Before I start describing each of the items, I would like to mention that they put mint in the water, so the water was fresh and tasted good. Also they provides pudina raita, onions dipped in vinegar and pickle. Also you can ask for lemons.  Achari Chicken: It was a great item. Perfectly cooked tandoori chicken with pickle. Full dish contains 8 pieces of chicken. Rating: 4.5/5  Butter kulcha was also perfectly baked, and exact amount of butter was brushed over it. Rating: 4.5/5  Kemma parantha was another mouth-watering item. A good layer of mutton keema was stuffed inside the parantha. Rating: 4.5/5  Pudina parantha was lip-smacking dish, and perfectly baked. I was bit worried about the taste of it, but they did it nicely. Rating: 5/5  At first, I felt the dal makhni was average, but after having few spoon of it. I got the taste of it. It tastes good with parantha. Precaution do not try the chicken gravy while having this item. If you do so, then you will lose the flavour of the dish. Rating: 4/5  Chicken lababdar was also a good choice. A semi-gravy dish and semi-spicy. Rating: 4/5  Veg Pulao: It was another great dish. Fine quality of rice was used to prepare it. Very simple dish, but the taste was great. Rating: 5/5  Masala rice was okay. Actually after having the great pulao, it did not get a chance to stand beside it. Rating: 2.5/5  Best lassi till now. They provided straw with the Punjabi lassi, but it was so thick that we were facing difficulty to have it using the straw. Rating: 5/5  At the end, we tried paan outside the dining area. It was good, but not the best. 3/5  Rating: 4.5/5  ------------------------------------------------------x--------------------------------------x------------------- In a nutshell, it was a great experience for us.  Recommended to other: Must try out this place.  Visiting twice: Definitely."
3.5,"offers good food no doubt about that. But Service is pathetic, actually pathetic is not a bad enough word. You will definitely feel frustrated with the service.."
3.0,Was here with friends. We reached the place slightly late in the evening on a weekend. We had expected the place to be crowded and it was.  However because of the crowd we did not expect the service to be so poor as we experienced it. No one was attending the customers and guiding them to tables which were ready to be occupied. Call service for menu/ordering you will be dealt with after 4-5 call or 15 minutes whichever is the later. Also they did not seem to be in any way interested in getting paid. Had to wait nearly 10 mins at the counter to pay.  However what made our experience somewhat better was the food. The paneer and the dal that we ordered was pretty good. The ambience of the place was also okay.   Overall a decent place to visit probably on a non weekend.
4.5,"We usually crave a lot for punjabi food as we don't belong to Bangalore. It has been our constant search to find a place where one can order from for authentic punjabi food. Every single time I have ordered, the food has been good. Only thing I feel can be a negative is that it's a little expensive but then when you want to have authentic punjabi food...you have to pay for you a little more. Go for the butter chicken and Kali daal...awesome."
3.5,"Food: 4/5 Ambience: 3/5 Delivery time: 3/5  If you are going to this place you go for the punjabi food, and for the sake of your taste buds.   It has two floors, first floor gives you a closed restaurant type feel and the second floor has a more open ambience, where it's almost like sitting under a covered roof, where you can see the road and all.  It is good for both nonveg and veg food. Didn't like the chocolate lassi though. Cheers!"
1.0,They are not ready to deliver food and says that the bill value should be more than 2000 rupees otherwise he would not deliver. Further he asks me to pick up food from mid place at some land mark. Very rude in behaviour. Zomato should remove these guys from delivery option.
4.0,"Having food there was delightful and hence we went back there again the very next day! The naan was soft, chicken tandoori was juicy, amm panna could have been better, fish was good. Over all great experience and quite cost effective. The momoe app played a great role here. I would've never known about this place if I had not received a notification for it. Received discounts only made the lunch ever so amazing."
4.0,"It's a small place that is easy to overlook. It has some daily specials and a fixed menu, mostly punjabi and north Indian cuisine. We ordered paneer taka tak and Kandhari Chicken as starter. Paneer taka tak was moderately spicy and very tasty, but I think it would fit better in main course. Kandhari chicken was non-spicy chicken based in yoghurt. I loved it. In main course we had Dum aloo and Rasoi special paneer. The paneer dish was one of the best paneer dishes I've had. Dum aloo was OK. I couldn't try a lot of non-vegetarian options as I was the only meat eater, but I've heard good things about those as well. A must try in bangalore."
3.5,I was surprised to find the vegetarian food delicious here. The Paneer tikka is a star and same goes with non veg. The service of great too.                                                                 anupamadolekar.wordpress.com
4.0,"Till now, hand's down the best north indian and especially the punjabi food in banaglore. the home delivery is awesome and pretty fast. We order from here like once in two weeks. Keep up the taste guys.                                                                 flavoursonmyfinger.wordpress.com"
3.0,"The Punjabi Rasoi serves reasonably priced, semi-authentic, generic North Indian fare without any pretense or fuss. While not particularly exciting, the place didn't disappoint on any of the dishes sampled and checked all the boxes for comfort food.  Our little dinner party of two vegetarians and myself (meat eater) gave the place a try on a Sunday night at around 9:00 in the p.m. (Note : They generally do not reserve on the weekends but tables move quickly so expect a wait, but not more than 15 minutes.)  The paneer tikka was rather flavorful and the paneer itself was soft, creamy, and fresh. I, myself, had a go at the Kandhari chicken which was also well marinated, flavorful, and just overall a success. All in all a great start to the meal. Main course was Dal Makhani, Shahi Paneer, and Aloo Gobi. While it wasn't a disaster, the Dal was lacking in depth of flavor and didn't balance its tomato tang with enough creaminess or spice. Similar story for the Shahi Paneer, which again had excellent quality of paneer but not much else. The Aloo Gobi, unfortunately, fell into the trap that mediocre Punjabi food in Bangalore often does where flavor and freshness are traded in for oil and spice, this was the only avoidable dish of the night. The rotis for the table were passable.  A quick shout out to the service staff, who were attentive, quick, and efficient, despite the restaurant operating at full capacity for the duration of our meal.  The ambience was very basic and gave the vibe that one shouldn't spend too long looking at the walls but just focus on the food and leave.  All in all, a pleasant enough experience. Food is reasonably priced and served with efficiency in a no frills environment.  Do Go : for a quick meal with friends when craving Punjabi food.  Dont Go : for your 10th anniversary dinner"
1.5,"There are few things in your life which you would like to undo, visiting this place is just one of the. What anexperience, after reading so many reviews I went there and all I could find was different dishes served in one masala though they had the creativity of giving each dish a different name, almost everything tasted like chaat and when we have almost given up we thought lets order sweet dish, after all how many people have the talent of screwing up a sweet dish but they did a stupendous job out of it. We ordered kheer which he corrected us by saying rice kheer, and irony was the rice kheer had no trace of kheer and we literally drank it. I am not sure, what makes people think that this is the best Punjabi outlet, I hated the food and will never ever go again there. Giving it 1.5 for its ambience at the top or the restaurant."
4.0,"We had to catch a night bus to Pondicherry , so we decided to have dinner at some nearby place to our pick up point .   Our craving for North Indian food led us to this place . Google Maps lead us easily to the place . It is located on 1st and 2nd floor , we took our seats on the 2nd floor ie the terrace . The place supports a normal cool ambience .  The menu is quiet elaborate . They have so many types of paneer , that one ends up getting confused . With the help of our waiter we ordered Paneer Butter Masala & Paneer Lababdar along with our usual breads.  Paneer Lababdar was really yummy ! Perfect taste . But paneer butter masala had a little extra salt , which ruined the taste . Quantity of both the curries was sufficient to serve 4 people with moderate appetite .   lachcha parantha was good , the garlic naans did not live upto expectations . One can skip them .   Service was quick and efficient . I do not remember the exact bill amount but it was between 600-700 ."
4.0,Awesome delicious food. Nice customer service and reasonable on the pocket too. The ambience may not be very pleasing but that's okay in return for mouth watering food.
4.0,Good North Indian Food. Ambiance here is just average. They'll make you wait a lot but what attracted me here is the pickle. This is the only place I found typical home made pickle which i got packed too. Have makki di roti and sarson da saag.
4.0,"I must say that this is one of the best punjabi food joints in Bangalore...........Veg, non veg, kababs, main course all of them are just top notch  A must visit place for any one who loves punjabi food..."
4.0,"If you want to have authentic punjabi/north Indian food.. They this place is a must try..  I have tried various dishes here and never got disappointed.. Prices are on higher side, but can afford for great taste..  Reducing 1 star due to high price :)"
5.0,First we went to this restaurant and would u believe it starters as well as gravy items were truely awesome and it was best in Bangalore.In starters chicken tandoori was juicy and in gravy chicken tikka masala and mutton rogan Jose must try.
4.0,Just head to this restaurant when you crave for having Punjabi food in Bangalore. They serve very good Punjabi food coupled with good ambiance. Food quality and portions are just a good match.  Ambiance: Nice Taste: Very good Value for money: 8/10 Service: Quick
4.0,They are one of the few in town who get the veg curries right.  Do not miss the Chur-chur roti. The ambience isn't great but manageable.   Good value for money
1.0,"Their delivery has been horrible. I orders my food at 8.30pm and it's nearly 10.15pm and the food is still not here. I would not recommend this place. I will not bother to rate the food, because of course it will taste good after they have kept me hungry way past any reasonable dinner time. Please do not order food from here. Unless u want it the next day."
4.0,"Not a fancy place but great quality authentic Punjabi food . There was a time we pretty much used to go here like every single day . Service is great too , they give special attention if you are regular ;)"
4.0,Been here quite a few times. This review is for veg dishes only.  Most of the items we tried were above average. Paneer dishes I like it here as I feel the paneer they use tastier than many other places. Dal makhani is must dish for me here.  Lassi is not so great compared to other Punjabi places.
5.0,"The best place to go for North Indian food and only for food. Here is my comment Food-5: I am giving 3 star only for the special and ""magical"" mango pickle. This Sunday i have tried Chicken Afghani it was simply awesome tender thick gravy mouth melting chicken every thing are perfect. In main course i order Chicken Hyderabadi if you are going for specie go for this one. In veg Bhindi do pyazza and paneer lababdar confusing to to choose between veg and non-veg. Service-4: Very good service, specially yesterday by one of the attender. It is always full of crowd and people are waiting outside for there turn thats way go early is my recommendation to avoid rush hours. Ambiance-3: As the place is small they try to accommodate large number of people in, look crowded all the time. But this thing is noting once you taste the food. Value of Money-5: Pocket friendly for everyone."
4.0,"Went out here for dinner. The decor and ambiance is okayish. But what steals the show is their food quality as well as quantity. Whenever I crave for Punjabi food, I am definitely returning here. I had the tastiest paneers and rotis than what I had anywhere in Bangalore. Costed us 800 bucks between 3 people (1 starter, 2 curries, 8 butter rotis) which is cheap compared to Bangalore's standards.  Definitely try this lip-smacking joint..!"
5.0,One of our Favorite Punjabi restaurants while we lived in Blr. Been there at least 20 times during our 4 year tenure in Blr.Baingan bharta is awesome. Miss the food a looooooot
4.0,"If you are not from punjab and you feel like having punjabi cuisine in an economic way, this is definitely the place for you.  Start with chicken tandoori and chicken achari.  Yes, they do speak hindi   Overall Rating- 4 / 5 Ambience- 4 / 5 Food quality and quantity- 4 / 5 Value for money - 4 / 5 Service - 4 / 5"
1.0,This place used to be nice but has become a shit-hole of late. Dont bother going in unless you're prepared to be embarrassed and leave with a half filled stomach
5.0,"Straight from the heart of Punjab. The taste and the service- Delightful. Anyone looking for yummy north indian style chicken dishes, this is the place to be. The ambience, the mood of the place is perfect."
3.0,"Ambiance: pretty average, when I went it was under renovation. Inside it's gloomy and little suffocating. Rating: Average  Food : Food is the best part of it if you really like spicy and tandoori stuffs. Chicken Chat"" is something one must try as starters. Chicken Lababdaar and Chicken Malamaal is also good. Other dishes are quite regular and average.   I prefer the HSR OUTLET more than this one. So overall rating for this : 3/5  Keep eating. Keep loving!"
4.5,Best authentic pubjabi restaurant in the area.awesome food with reasonable rates.Amritsari kulcha is just too awesome.if you are looking for good punjabi food you are at right place. Only con is slow service
5.0,"Me and My wife are pure north indians foodies, hence we were trying different home delivery outlets on our 15 day trip toBangalore, as we have a 4 month old daughter with us, hence cannot take her everywhere. We started from all famous Mast Kalandar, then Tadka Singh, Vasudev Adiga however our search stopped when we had food from the punjabi rasoi. simply delicious, and authentic in taste. we used to order food from Indira Nagar outlet to Ulsoor Road, hence delay in delivery still it used to be hot. We tried, Dal Makhani, Dal tadka, Dum Aloo, Malai Kofta, Lacha Paranthas are myfavorites. I would personally recommend every north indian visiting bangalore to try food here, you willdefinitelynot regret going here.."
2.5,"Not a good experience with home delivery. I have been there more than 4times a d just love their food and specially the dum biryani. Wanted my mum to try the dum biryani so ordered few dishes for home delivery.  When the order arrived , I noticed that the biryani was not there. I asked the delivery boy regarding the same and after 5mins he returned with a biryani box and stated it is of another customer which he provided to us.  The briyani  was totally different not like the one I always tried in their restaurant. I doubt if it was really from their res like the delivery boy stated or from a res neaby my house  The other dishes were fab , delicious. I prefer going directly to their restaurant . A big NO to home delivery"
4.0,If there's a north Indian heaven in Bangalore.. It's here.. It's here.. It's here.. :) A Vegetarian's paradise too. Esp. Recommend the modest aam panna & veg kofta :) *slurp*
4.5,"Thanks to my friend who has recommended this beauty ... its a delight for indian punjabi foodies .... This restaurant has two floors with different themes. 1st floor is of modern styled with AC and 2nd floor is retro styled & a Non-AC one. Every time it has lived upto our expectation with consistent qualities, irrespective of the weekend rushes. Kababs and keema parathas are excellent but somehow I feel they lack in rice department especially the biriyani. Rest ... its burps."
4.5,Well what do I say about this place!!! Just splendid.... The chicken kandhari and tomato chicken are just amazing... If u don't order them on your visit then u haven't eaten at this place at all...
3.0,"We popped in here for a weeknd lunch, oredred Nargisi kebab, fish tikka and chicken manchw soup in startrs/appetizers. And Chicken Punjabi for main course.  Food quality - I found the starters not very juicey.. Chickn in kebabs was very fibrous and tight.  Service - They take a lot of time to get the order. Even for simple breads they take hell lot of time.   Ambience - Good interiors. But not very extra ordinary. I suggest to dine in on the second floor which is rooftop.  Resonable."
4.0,We go whenever we miss punjabi dal tadka and kadhai paneer! This place with its quaint interiors is a delight for North Indians staying in Bangalore. Reasonably priced and mouth watering chicken dishes is what we get here. They have this amazing pickle that blows our mind every time. The lassi and aampanna is just outstanding. Thanks for spoiling us with such good food :)
2.5,"The food was ok, hospitality was also fine, nothing great about the experience. Just the decor of the ceiling was quiet quirky, I liked that."
3.0,This Punjabi Rasoi is better than the HSR Layout one... Good non vegetarian food but again advice to the management to reduce the prices and excess oil from the paneer dishes. :-)
1.0,"Pathetic food. Pathetic hospitality. And dare not give your feedback. Coz they don't care and if they dnt like your feedback, they give their feedback on u. Food was not fresh. All drinks were nt cold while all food were."
4.0,"Craving for an authentic Punjabi dinner led us here.. A place with zero frills, serves good food. Ram, who attended to us was top class when it came to customer service! Ppl like them make a difference to the overall experience.   We ordered butter milk which was average. For main course we ordered Chicken Labadar, boneless chicken blended with rich spices. A pretty neat dish! One gets to taste 'authentic' punjabi mango pickle here!    The unique thing about this place is steel cutlery. Big plates and glasses, something that's so typical of Punjabi culture.   Overall a good experience. We were out in 45 mins, thanks to the quick service!   Value for money - 4.5/5."
4.5,Awesome.... Great food and economical  Punjab Rasoi reminds me of a typical restraunt in north india. Great food nice family ambience and pocket friendly. Food here is excellent. Chicken lababdar and Nargisi tikka are must try. I have visited the place now 3-4 times and haven't been disappointed till now.  My advice - Must visit place for all the foodies who love north Indian cuisine.  Ambience could be improved a little but food here compensates for everything.  Overall a nice eating joint
2.0,Not sure where to start from....have been to HSR layout outlet earlier n was surprised by the mouth smacking food....same was my expectations when i visited indiranagar outlet as v were damn hungry after a loong and warm afternoon. Ordered achari paneer tikka for starters but to my surprise it came cold. Though it tasted nice n my hunger resisted me to complain about it. After a looong wait The main course was brought to the table. And the guy who got it to the table did not bother to serve the same. Same as paneer tikka story breads and curries served was cold...the reason being they got the food and kept it on the serving table for 15 mins before bringing the same to our table. After 5 more mins a waiter came up and asked vd a smirk on face do i need to serve...!! I was amazed as this is the first time some one behaved like that in a restro....still i kept cool and asked him to serve. The way that guy started serving curries i asked him to stop and said i ll help myself. He kept the he curries on the table and started laughing on my face. I asked him to is this the way you treat ppl to this he kept on laughing. I asked him to call the manager he still kept laughing and finally called the manager. To my surprise the manager too was not keen on listening to what happened. Just for name shake he told the guy who took our order to be cautious so that things like this does not repeat and went off though we kept on complaining that the food is cold. I wanted to walk off from there but decided not to disrespect food. Ate a bit and asked them to parcel rest of it and give it to some one in need.  To be frank am a big time foodie and i love trying new restaurant's. I never write reviews coz i feel ppl shud visit places without pre formed opinions. Being from kolkata Till date i was happy about one thing in banaglore restaurants...the service irrespective of food. But this visit of mine to the punjabi rasoi has really left a bad taste in my mouth.  Writing this review just to kp frnds aware of it so that u find out better options before visiting this place in Indiranagar.
4.5,"For a north Indian to satiate his craving for dilli like food, this is the place. Exceptional service with unmatched food quality across Bangalore. Every food item was delightfully tasty and served well in time. The pricing also is very reasonable. The ambience though is average but good food more than makes up for it"
4.5,"I am in love with this place. One of the finest punjabi food i have tasted. Been to this place like thrice already (twice in hsr) and i just cant stop trying out new things here. Quite expensive but its ok, worth the price. Parents too just loved the food. I would suggest that its a must try for punjabi food lovers."
4.5,Amazing food! Do try Punjabi Paneer with Garlic Nan. Sometimes the service is a bit slow but I can ignore that.  One suggestion: Please start serving sirke wale pyaz.
3.5,Good place to visit with family and friends. Food was tasty for me. Some of friends felt the food was bit spicy. Must try. Will visit again..
3.5,"The first time I went there, the food was amazing. When I went there recently, the quality of food had degraded a bit . The Kulchas and Naans are amazing , try them with Panner butter masala or malai kofta. Also, if you really totally into Punjabi food, you can go for a better place."
4.5,Grt food and very nice service.. Love and enjoy with family. Ambience was good. First time tried sarso da sag and maki de Roti which was a great taste. Chicken chat was Grt in starter. All together Grt place for non veg.
1.0,"I went to this restaurant earlier also but its sad to say that food quality degraded over period of time leaving service quality apart which always has been downside. Recently mine group of 9 went there for dinner, the food was cold and stale. We ordered Chicken Biryani but it was not proper rice, Butter Chicken was like Dal and Chicken Tandoori was like Chicken Fry. Even beverages which hardly take time to prepare were tasteless (butter milk, jaljeera). Same was story with Veg guys - it seems they were following Java's principal prepare once use everywhere. Each veg dish was having same gravy. Also there menu was confusing, apparently there is three tier of hierarchy - small, medium and full. So be careful while ordering or you may pay more (since people there will not tell you anything, cheers one more star for quality service). I would not recommend this to anyone."
3.5,"We came for Lunch here with my friends. It is very simple restaurant. From outside, it looks good but from inside it is very simple and like normal restaurant. We ordered tangadi kabab, lemon chicken, lollipop, mutton. Tangadi kabab was not at all good and it spoiled our taste completely but somehow we managed the taste with Lime soda. And then we had some other starters which was better. Main course items are far better than starters. Lassi and Mathha were also good. Service was very bad. I didn't like it at all. value for money - 5/5 non-veg - 3.5/5(main course -4/5 & starters - 3/5) veg - 3.5/5 (main course -3.5/5 & starters - 3/5) Frankly speaking, i will not recommend this to my friends."
3.5,"Went there for team lunch on a quiet friday afternoon.We have been ordering from here for quite some time now and the food never failed to appeal to our tastebuds.The interiors are quite spacious and they even have a rooftop open air kind of decor where you can dine in the evenings.Coming to the food,we ordered tomato chicken and achari chicken for starters.Please believe them when they say tomato chicken is their specialty...its absolutely awesome.The chicken is succelent,cooked perfectly and with the tight amount of spices.For main course we ordered butter chicken,chicken lababdar,rotis and peas pulao...the butter chicken and peas pulao they serve here is a combo to die for.. its the closest to authentic punjabi food in bangalore.Finish it off with a nice cold glass of lassi or buttermilk..u will not regret.Why the 3.5....coz i could only rate the nonveg stuff,although the bhindi masala tasted really awesome.Worth a visit...and extremely pocket friendly."
3.5,"For a good authentic Punjabi food, Punjabi Rasoi stands up to its expectations. Their Makki ki roti was a tad different than the conventional. However it went well with the Saarson da saag and their Daal Makhni was appreciable too.  One unique feature I noticed was they add a tiny piece of mint in their regular water which some of you might not like it. Do watch out!  But overall food, ambience and service was satisfactorily good."
2.0,Quality of food is decreasing nowadays. Everything was extra oily and salty. Only tomato dhaniya shorba was good. Had ordered Punjabi paneer and methi roti.
4.0,"If you're craving for authentic Punjabi food, this is the place you should visit and eat till your tummy says enough... I had been skeptical about trying Punjabi food in Bangalore but this place just made me visit them again and again. Good food, good service and a prime location."
4.0,Me along with my friends went to indira Nagar punjabi rasoi restaurant on 21 may 2015. I have ordered punjabi mutton curry and punjabi chicken fry along with amrithsari kulcha. The kulcha is awesome and mutton curry is very tasty. I never had these much tasty mutton curry in bangalore.   I will recommend this hotel for ur family.
1.0,"Horrible service! Horrible food. I'm writing this review while we are still waiting for the bill. It's been almost 20mins since we asked for the bill. The parathas were half cooked. Great, now he says we have to go down to pay the bill! :-/"
3.5,I would say the place gives you an almost authentic experience. Ambience is kind of ok and the menu is good enough. Food was a little extra masaledar to my liking but tasted good. Surely worth a try.
4.5,awsmest food in town I have tasted in last few months in Bangalore. I amyet to find a better place. They don't market well or they would have a better footfall
5.0,Mouthwatering and yummy punjabi food. The chicken pieces served are huge and not in small chunks. Must try Chicken Chaat and Chicken Dum biriyani. Reasonable prices too.
4.0,These people are very bad... They made me an addict. Especially to tomato chicken. I had not so good experience with the Hsr branch. So I was a bit skeptical about this one too. This turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Very good food and great service. I prefer the rooftop area. I wanted to play that dhol so badly. I didn't just because I know how good I am in playing it . The food is one of the best.. They and tandoori tal will be trading blows if it comes to food. They have ample selection for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The only thing I felt they are lacking is the drinks department. Not many options are there. The service and the prices are pretty good. A must try for anyone who loved punjabi food.
4.0,A few places that claim to serve Punjabi cuisine actually taste like authentic Punjabi cuisine. This place is one of those few places. The ambience and the tableware definitely live up to the Punjabi Rasoi name. Try the makki di roti and sarso da saag if you've been missing your punjabi home food for quite some time. Definitely a visit once again place.
3.5,"Good starters, great curries and total value for money!   True to its name, Punjabi rasoi has some tadka punjabi food! The afghani chicken- soft malai marinated chicken, is beautifully cooked, and better than the ones you'll find elsewhere! The indian breads, jeera rice and chicken/paneer kadais are creamy and totally yummy too! All this taste coupled with reasonable prices makes Punjabi rasoi a perfect destination for those north-indian food cravings!   Home delivery adds much convenience and brings the punjabi food only closer to you! This place is a must try when you wish to satiate those cravings for rich tadkedaar punjabi khaana"
4.5,"I really like the food here.. quite authentic north indian food. Though a bit on the greasy side, you always have a choice to leave the gravy out."
4.0,3/5 ambiance 5/5 Price- Value for Money 4/5 - food 3/5 Service  You can have food there regulatory!  Try Butter chicken or Butter paneer with Amritsari Kulcha. It is place where you can treat give 20 person treat for as low as 8k to 10k. Our office manger did so. You will mostly see north Indian crowd but all south Indian enjoyed this too.
4.5,"From 6 years i am going to this place and i did get differ in the taste not even once,Same aroma, same taste same level of spiciness Truly Punjabi.This place is ideal for Spice lovers for both Non veg and veg. Spicially Chicken Malamaal and Chicken hariyali is out of the world..Lassi is awesome all the time. Luv this always you are a reason to come back to bangalore again and again"
3.0,I came here with one of my friends who had recommended me this place .  Indeed a real good ambience..great service and great food.  For.nice good proper punjabi food..one has to be here
4.0,"I came to this place with a friend who has already been here. With the kind of reviews I had got, I expected nothing less than a perfect dinner from here.  And guess what, I returned with a smile and stomach filled with delicious Punjabi Rasoi Food. We ordered the Afghani Chicken(recommended) which is quite famous here. 15 minutes later, the taste revealed why it's famous. To add to the creamy taste, they have a mint chutney which simply stands out. You have got to taste to believe it.  After our starters, we ordered Chicken Butter Masala and Garlic Nan. The butter masala had good mix of sweet and spicy and it tasted well with the nan.  How could we not order the Punjabi Lassi from here?! We did so but much to our disappointment it did not stand out like the rest of the food. The Lassi felt overpriced as well.  The waiting time is 15-20 minutes and services were okayish. All in all, a place you should go!"
3.0,"We visited this place with a lot of expectation after reading the reviews. The rooftop ambience was very nice. There was a single guy trying to take orders, serve eye for the entire floor while a couple of others appeared confused on what to do. As a consequence,  the service was hurried and it took quite a while to get the order. The paneer tikka was ok to start with. The paneer was very soft but the dish was quite oily. The main course was extremely oily again and though it tasted ok we really didn't feel like enjoying the fish. The breads were also drenched in butter/ghee/oil.  The place could be perfect if only they hire more people and reduce oil usage!"
3.5,Food 5/5 ... Great Punjabi Food...  Ambiance : 3/5 .. Just a standard Eatery though they have renovated the exterior recently.  Service : 2.5/5 .. You will find quite a few stewards around but unfortunately they do find you until you scream at least 3 times. They even messed the parcel order we had placed.  Price : 3.5/5 .. Good Food .. Good Price but considering the location and ambiance it could have been priced lower.
1.0,Home delivery service is too disappointing !!!! And their management too is non co-operative...    highly disappointed with their service 6) management too is rude and non coperative
1.0,"Pathetic delivery and customer service. Knowing that the place has very bad delivery service we ordered food at 7 pm expecting to get it delivered by 8:30 - 8:45 but I was wrong they went beyond expectation, I got food at 9:29 pm exact in 4-5 km range. In between we called the restaurant/delivery guy 2-3 times and guess what I got, all lies (and owner was rude in responding). In the end after getting the order when I told them that I am never ever going to order from you then I got ""koi baat nahi"" as their response. Very much disappointed with the Customer Service."
3.5,Lousy service...but definetly value for money.. Great place to take ur stingy food guzzling pals for a lunch / dinner..portions are good.. Recommend the top floor seating to the more cramped lower floor..
1.0,"I wish I could give it a zero rating. Pathetic service, especially when you order home delivery. Ordered at 7 PM on a Sunday for a delivery address less than 5 km. At 8 PM the manager tells me that the delivery buy had left at 7.45 PM with my order.  At 8.30 the delivery boy confirms that he had left the outlet only 5 minutes ago. Now either the manager is lying or the delivery boy is.  In either case, they killed the apetite. Now I don't know what bad I can write, but just this : please avoid this restaurant. They don't care for the customer, and thr y definitely take any complaints as jokes."
1.0,One of worst restaurant for service....food is OK but if you order food for home delivery...then please make sure order it 3 hours before your lunch/dinner time( prefer completing  a movie before that).. As they are so slow that even one can go thrice and get the food by themselves. Most hyped restaurant in Bangalore :( .... Would not prefer it to anyone...
1.0,"Classic example of taking customer for granted, average delivery time for last 5 times has been ~ 1.5 hours for a 1 km range. When i called them after 1 hour they told me delivery guy was out 20 minutes back. When i called them after 1.5 hours they told me delivery guy can reach anytime. When i called them after 1.75 hours they gave me the delivery boy phone number. When i called the delivery guy after 1.80 hours the delivery guy told me that he has just came out if the restaurant and it would take 15 mins at-least to reach there.  Huge -1 to Punjabi Rasoi."
3.5,"I had been there for lunch. The whole ambiance is nice. The staff is friendly. The food was not great at the same time not bad either. Lassi was a huge disappointment. The pulkas were fabulous and the sabzi was ok. The rice was undercooked.  Once you step out of the restaurant there is a panwala, a great way to finish your meal."
4.0,"Really nice North Indian ""Vegetarian"" Food, which is not that easy to find in Bangalore. I have visited this place a couple of times. Haven't been disappointed. Really value for money. They have terrace seating also. Service is good. Our server was really polite and helpful. We had a really nice time. Ambiance is okay-ish. But it is cheap. Around 300 per person for nice, full meal. Real value for money."
4.0,"This is one authentic place to eat Punjabi food around Indira nagar mg road areas. Very simple but wonderful ambience. Think they could have had an extra TV or two for cricket lovers like me especially during world cup and IPL ;) Nevertheless food was tasty and authentic. You have to try their jaljeera, aampanna and mango lassi (seasonal). Service was quick and staff is friendly. And very economical as compared to the other joints around this area and the food here is also a few notches better. Do not forget the Pan available just at their entrance."
3.5,"8 pm on a weekday and we were the only customers der. There is no parking facility, need to find a spot on the nearby gullys. Ordered Nargisi chicken which was good and Chicken chat which was not that great. Phulkas were not hot but drenched in ghee.   Butter kulcha were ok. Mutton Rogan Ghosh was a perfect accompaniment. Lassi was a let down after all the reviews raving about it, maybe today it wasnt good."
3.5,DO NOT MISS THEIR AFGHANI CHICKEN AND PANEER TIKKA. Unbelievably tasty. Service needs to be a little faster. Overall a nice place for a team lunch or a get together. Well-located in the heart of Indira Nagar
1.0,"Waste, the food quality is not so good as the compared to Punjabi rasoi in R.T NAGAR. Plz people don't go there rt nagar panjabi rasoi is best............."
3.5,"Good food, waiting on weekends, reach early....service bit disappointing but always good for foodies. Stuff kulcha n amritsari kulcha are all time fav, try aloo Dum."
1.5,"Hmm. Ambience s good. I saw all these good reviews about the restaurant. But I have to say I am disappointed. I am a vegetarian. So I cannot say anything about the non vegetarian dishes in this restaurant. Although my colleagues said it was really good. But the vegetarian dishes were really disappointing. Everything was so oily, I couldn't eat it. The oil was overpowering the actual taste of the dish. So I would not recommend this place, for vegetarians atleast."
4.5,"Best Punjabi Restaurant in Town. Ambiance is better on the 2nd Floor (roof top). They dont make their dishes too spicy. The Nargisi Chicken is the best so far. I also like the Chicken Punjabi with Butter Naan. And Mutter Paneer. They have Masala Thumbs Up which is again difficult to get here. A good one. A lot of ghee in every dish, hence people watching their weight need to rethink. Also the pickle they serve is home made and is to die for. Overall a very pleasant experience. Will go again."
4.5,Excellent place for foodies. Had been there today for lunch and was amazed with colorful cool place differing from the other familiar soberplaces.. Plenty of starters to choose from and I had went with Kandhari chicken which was an ideal starter.Followed it up with Aloo parathas and butter kulchas which jus melted on ur mouth along with Chicken Malammal making it an yummy combination of spice and butter.Ended with a bigg burpp with the big lassi provided and I m sure this is not going to be my only visit..
3.0,"Food: 2.75/5 Home delivery time: 45 min to 1 hour Attitude: Very good   I had recommended this place to many of my friends because of the great food and quality. I had ordered for chilly panneer and Veg fried rice for home delivery. I had got the order after 45 min. The veg fried rice had a complete weird taste and a weird smell. The quantity of the Chilly panneer was very less. It was 205 rupees and I had got around 4-5 pieces of Chilly Panner and it was not at all good. I had called up the restaurant and told them about Veg Fried rice, he talked very gently and said he would replace it. So, I said I would go for veg biryani. The Veg biryani arrived in 30 min and I can tell that all the rice grains in Biriyani were dripping in oil. I was wondering if each grain was fried in oil like a puri. I did not eat any of it. Restaurant should work on the home deliveries and their quality mainly."
3.0,"Above the food the ambience was pretty refreshing. I guess the sudden downpour in Bangalore this week helped the cause. We have ordered amritsari kulcha, which was not up to the mark and veg kofta gravy was bit oily. However it had the taste of Punjab in it and the waiters were courteous to accommodate our inputs and the food was served hot and fresh. I would love to visit again."
2.5,Used to come to this place when it was a small joint. The Afghani chicken n mutton rogan gosh n biryani was simply out of this world. Now this place has lost its charm n essence by going big.. Sad...Sad indeed
3.5,"Went here for the team lunch , the ambience is fine nothing extraordinary the music has all peppy Punjabi songs, paneer is something you should look forward too, it's really soft and melts in ur mouth right away. Overall everything we ordered was good and the quantity was value for money. Must try : lassi, and Peshawari paneer Tikka"
4.0,"If you love punjabi food ,you will love this place . It is way cheaper than many bangalore restraunt and beats them at taste ! Love their starters, ambience is average,nothing special. Good for family and team outings, or a gathering with your friends.Love their chicken starters and main course .Keema parathas are very nice."
4.0,"Punjabi Rasoi  Wah is the word. Wow, I had been there a number of times and everytime they impress me. Not just the consistency with which they cook, but also they cook the food to perfection. Calories? What ? I dont hear it. I dont mind it. Sinfully delicious and one of the best Punjabi places.  So long ago, myself and office colleagues had dined out here. Ever since, it became our budget-office-luncheon order in. All their gravies are smacking and they have so many of them. Methi Malai Paneer  and Kadai Veg is my favourite.  I absolutely recommend this place"
5.0,Best punjabi food ever had in Bangalore at such affordable prices Service was superfast n food was mouth watering . Amritsari kulcha n lassi  are a must order
4.5,"Its been a long time we had punjabi food in Bangalore so we decided yesterday to give a try.Zomato helped us selecting Punjabi Rasoi which was close to where we were.  Amazing food and ambience.Loved the ceiling full of kites.Coming to food-Keema (Mutton) paratha is a must try.Yummy and very filling.Dal Makhani and Lassi was ok ok not so great but Mutton Rogan Josh and Mixed raita was excellent.After a long time we had a good mutton rogan josh.We couldnt try desserts as we were full by then.  Overall,nice place to dine.Wont call it a fine dining restaurant but without any doubt a perfect place to have dinner when you dont want to cook and want to try something north indian food.  Service and courtesy was also perfect."
4.5,I love the food here. The best north indian restaurant in indiranagar for sure! The dal Makhani and chicken lababdar are just yummm. For biryanis..hyd biryani house is usually my favorite. But i tried the egg biryani here last night...and it was delicious!!!  I dont like the ambience too much...hence i order in everytime!   Ambience : 2/5 Food: 4.5/5 Value for money: 4.5/5
3.5,"It's a spacious restaurant, I like it for that, good food with decent price range also, what would be more fantastic if instead of glasses they make it a bit more open, makes it claustrophobic!  Their service I liked the most, decent behavior, overall good food, place a 3.5 from my side :)"
4.0,"Are you a Punjabi food lover? Whatever is your reply, you must try this place, you will definitely going to like it. Located near canara bank, near bda complex, indiranagar. It has 2 floor for dining, i prefer the top one as it has some open air touch to it whereas the other one is more sort of closed ac hall with kites on their celings. On the table, they have paper which tells you about the popularity of punjabi rasoi and this is also helpful in ordering food as They have listed their popular items in it. When you are in a punjabi restaurant then ordering punjabi lassi is a must. Trust me, this will be one of the best lassi you have ever tried. Thick and optimum sweet. This place is known for its really quick service. Paneer Achari was tasty. Mutton rogan josh was good but was served cold. Best was paneer punjabi, reddish semi gravy with great and different taste, that you will end up licking your fingers. Must order this ! Daal makhani was good with a layer of butter, that enhanced its taste. Masala papad with their green chutney tasted so good. Its slight expensive but for such food you will not regret paying."
4.5,"This is one of the restaurant u shud look for really authentic punjabi food and that too at competitive price. Ambience- very normal, considering its a budget restaurant,i am ok with that. Chicken malai tikka- very soft and juicy Fish tikka- sumptuous  Butter chicken- cant get better Chicken bharta-- really loved this dish and gor it parcel also.. Loved it Nargisi chichen- yummy  Will really like to visit again. Only one dissapointment- they opened an outlet in whitefield which they closed ?. Please open it again"
2.0,Ordered food at 9 o clock .. Food arrived at 10.45 ..This is poorest ever i have seen..Specially in Bangalore.. Had a very good reputation bout this place.. But no communication n such a delay in delivery without any communication n reason is unacceptable..
4.0,Food is good in quality as well as in quantity. Typical punjabi dhaba style - oily but awesome.                                              Simply eat with heart out.
3.5,"Have been to this place twice. Even though the ambiance is just fine, the place offers you great food. If you are a dhaba types punjabi food fan do visit this place and try chicken tikka masala."
4.5,"What an amazing place...! Worth going for a weekend dinner with friends or family. I have already been there three times and never disappointed with food and service they provide. Their special panjabi paneer is really very tasty. Their Non-veg is also very good. Just go and try, it is Worth."
3.5,"Punjabi Rasoi, literally translating to Punjabi Kitchen, is situated on a by lane of the 100ft. road. You can se the metro line from there. There is no valet parking or anything so you can take your chances parking on the roads nearby. A little hard to spot but just look for the sign on the first floor and you will be able to spot it. We climb up a flight of stairs to reach the restaurant, but since we opted to sit on the rooftop, we climbed yet another flight of stairs. The ambience is ok, the rooftop is surrounded by glass, so it is kind of like sitting inside a glasshouse for a while but you get used to it.  Coming to the food, we ordered Tomato soup, sweet corn soup, Paneer Aachaari, BabyCorn Tandoori, Veg Seekh Kabab, Phulkas, Malai Kofta, Mint Paneer, Sarson Ka Saag, Boondhi Raitha and of course, the lassi. A plate containing onions, mint chutney and pickle is kept on the table initially. And if you think the water here tastes funny, fret not, they actually have a lemon and a few sprigs of mint in all the water jugs.  The soups were both excellent, the tomato soup tangy and creamy with crunchy breadcrumbs, sweet corn soup fresh with vegetables. The Paneer was soft and tender, babycorn was crunchy, but both the items were on the spicy side. The veg Seekh Kabab was ok , not a dish that i would recommend. The phulkas were soft and dipped in ghee. The Mint Paneer was excellent and is a dish worth ordering. The Sarson ka Saag was something none of us enjoyed. The Malai Kofta was good enough. The hero of the day was definitely the Lassi, we ordered the quintessential Punjabi Lassi and it was heavenly, tastes delicious and it was so thick it had some difficulty getting up the straw initially. All in all, an ok place to visit, but if you are a fan of Punjabi food, you must visit this place."
1.5,"On a friends recommendation thought of checking out this place.. since from being Delhi i mostly end up missing north Indian food. But sadly, apart form the interesting decor of using kites(supposedly bought from Delhi), nothing about this place was really great. Yes it might seem that I am ranting but I really wish there was some sort of silver lining to my experience. The food - the main reason for going there, was nothing exceptional. The food mostly was over spiced and somehow was an assault on the palate. I find the food served in Kund much better in quality and taste. On the other hand the service was really really terrible, right from the owner to the waiters everybody seemed to have an attitude of 'be happy that you are eating at our place'. If you ask them more about the food they dont explain it nor do they appreciate it. Try it next time, ask them how one dish is separate from others and you would understand. This is the kind of place you should not go to after having a good time somewhere else.. it would just completely ruin your mood.. The funny part is this place will not lose any of its standing.. whereas there many more, restaurants out there which are much better than them... alas c'est la vie... P.S: I have been there twice just to get tide over the the first experience... no luck..."
3.5,"Decent veg food, okish service but non-veg is tasty. They have a nice menu for chicken items. Each one's worth it. A regular sunday dine out for me as this is relatively cheaper than other restaurants around this area!!"
4.5,Brilliant north Indian food... ambience make u feel like eating authentic north Indian food at a dhaba... yummy yummy kalmi kababs .. totally love it!
3.5,Was there with colleagues for lunch after a meeting and the food was good the prices were okay and the ambiance was nice. Will wisit again..
4.5,"Best place in Bangalore for Punjabi food, Both Vegetation and Non-Vegetarian main course dishes are to die for.You cant go wrong with this place"
5.0,Still one my favorite place for north Indian food. I love their malamal chicken paneer. Tandori mushroom . I love the ambience also end the meal with pan.
2.0,"I had heard a lot about this place and finally went here with a friend for dinner after watching kingsman. You can imagine the mood was really upbeat after a wonderful movie and the punjabi rasoi staff did everything to ruin it. We were waiting for a table at the terrace and no staff was interested in seating us. Other groups of people who came after us were just hovering around yet to be cleaned tables and sat comfortably while we waited to be seated. So much for the first in first out concept. The servers did not seem to care and were rude when I told them that shouldn't we be getting a table first !!! I was determined to eat irrespective of this lousy service. But didn't realize that was just the beginning. We ordered fresh lime water- they didn't have it. They were out of lemons !!!!!  We ordered chicken haryali- it's too damn good. You gotta try it. And that's the only reason the place is even getting a rating of 2. The waiters didn't provide glasses until I asked. They just dumped the food along with the starters. The food that we ordered - paneer butter masala and chicken malaamal were too spicy and salty. Even By my standards!!!! I eat chillies like desserts and always put extra salty but I couldn't savor their damned food. We ordered for 2 more breads at 10:42 pm and the server said ""sir I told you to order earlier, there is nothing now "" and made a face. I was almost on the edge of my temper but really didn't wanna ruin my kingsman experience. I wish I could complain about the waiters working at the terrace. It's one of the most lousy service I have ever come across. Really lousy. I have not seen such waiters who treat guests like filth of a burden while serving, seating or taking orders. The head server at terrace really needs to be thrown out and some discipline is required by the manager for his team."
4.0,"Has been on my hit list for quite a while and I finally got a chance yesterday, went there with some colleagues for lunch and was blown over by the simplicity of the place... exceptionally friendly staff and the food is to die for... the icing on the cake is the glass lassi that you must have over your meal... I am surely going back again to tey everything on their menu..."
4.0,The Punjabi rasoi in Bangalore is just perfect place for dining. Its taste of dishes just make go the tongue go lullaby. Once I happened to order mint chutney and naun and chicken fry. The dish was prepared as it was just brought from Punjab.Also the restaurants awesome service just astonished me a lot.The chicken fry was freshly prepared and naun was perfectly made.That day I had the dinner to my stomach full.
4.0,One of the best place to eat north Indian/Punjabi food in Bangalore. If you like spicy food you should definitely visit this place. I have been to this umpteen number of times and I have never been disappointed. Please dont have high expectations for the ambience. Also expect some waiting time during peak hours on weekends.  Note: This is the only place where you will find soya chaap (they have named the dish veg tikka masala) in Bangalore.
4.0,Mouth watering punjabi food  Best butter kulchas I have ever tried..thin crust and melts in mouth...kandahari chicken is yummy too..we had typical punjabi bhendi Masala.lassis are very filing..punjabi special lassi is very yumm?
3.5,"The place is alright, but nothing stands out. Will start with Ambiance, The place offers an average at best ambiance(Atleast for lunch). The roof is decorated with lots of colourful kites, which looks nice. About the food, Its good, but as i mentioned earlier, nothing great about it. Just another decent punjabi restaurant. Starters:- 1) Hariyali kebab, I am not a big fan of it, but my friends ordered. It was better than most of the hariyali kebabs I have eaten, so i was satisfied. 2) Mushroom tikka, It wasn't really a tikka, coz the mushrooms were small and cut and didn't seem to hv the tandoori flavour, rather, it was more of a stir fry with tandoori vegetables. Nothing great about it, but not bad. Main Course 1) Dal Tadka, Punjabi restaurant and not ordering a Dal Makhani or Tadka is like a crime for me! :P Ordered, Dal Takda, which was again average. Not bad, but not even close to the great ones i have had 2) Paneer Lababdar, My friends liked it, but it was not the warm and creamy gravy I am used to eat in my Paneer/Chicken Lababdar. It was spicy and although good, it wasn't what i was expecting. Paneer pieces were soft and tender. 3) Phulka, THIS WAS MY PROBLEM with the place. They serve already made phulkas, Yes, not the fresh from the gas, but the ones made some time back. To enjoy Phulkas with my food, I would like to have fresh phulkas. And although they were soft, but they were not hot, luke warm at its hottest. Which was a let down. Drinks: Ordered fresh lime soda, which was good.  Also, the qty of food is really good. One dal and one gravy was more than sufficient for three people. We ended up leaving dal and gravy in the end. So, order wisely.  Another problem that I noticed was, although there was enough staff, there were a lot of unclean tables, just sitting there to be cleaned by someone. So, although u can have 4 options of tables, u can find only 1 clean table to sit. Else you will have to grab attention of the cleaning guys to get the table cleaned. The management has to take care of it.  Bottom Line, would like to visit the place once again for the Non Veg menu, and probably during dinner to see if the service improves in night..."
4.0,Went to Punjabi Rasoi for dinner. The Chilly Paneer was great! The Hyderabadi Paneer and Achaari Paneer were the best Paneer main course dishes I've had till date! The ambience is cozy and service is great.
3.0,Not the best Indian food in Bangalore but doable. Ambience is decent but open air like most restaurants on 100ft road. I must say the service was pretty decent and pricing is pretty cheap.
4.5,"An amazing place for great food and some great chicken with authentic Punjab spices, Punjabi rasoi has really pulled it off. The place is situated on the 1st floor and is decorated with old kites and a spideman cut out. Lol.. But certainly you get a feel of a Punjabi dhaba. Coming to the food, for starters we had Punjabi special chicken which was pretty spicy and roasted, then came the main course with malai chicken and kulcha dripping with ghee. Dam its impossible to describe!!! Heaven!!!! Finally to top it off you get the great lassi which comes in different flavours such as chocolate, strawberry and mango. But we just had the good old Punjabi sweet lassi and bon appetite!! :) Must visit place for some great chicken, screw the ambience and everything just eat!!!"
3.0,"Lassi is good. Chicken items are all spicy and good. The starters were not that good. Lehsuni chicken is only malai chicken here. Fish is very very bad. Don't try. I was disappointed by the fish, it was sour in taste and bad sea fish is in the menu."
5.0,"If you are a Non Veg lover, look no further! These guys have an amazing kitchen that cooks magic repeatedly! Kandahari chicken is in itself a mesmerizing dish that would make you lick your fingers to the bone....every other item is definitely worth trying! Excellent veg and non veg spreads, each better than the other! Eat your heart out!"
4.0,Ambience is just ok but the food is real tasty. The staff is very well mannered and the dishes are prepared the way you want.  Ambience : 3/5 Food taste : 4/5 Overall : 4/5
3.5,"If you like Punjabi food, then this is the place to go to for some good chicken fare. There is no ambience but the chicken chatpata (really yum m consistently so), chicken amritsari, chicken hyderabadi, chicken Punjabi are good but on the spicy side, its also quite greasy but I like the taste. The rotis are good too. The vegetarian dishes, Chinese dishesare below average so is butter chicken. Ask the senior waiters for their recommendation and then order. The mint chutney and small onions go well with the dishes. The mouth freshener(I usually dont like it) at the end of the meal is also delicious n addictive."
4.0,Authentic punjabi touch.... Easy on pocket... Pathetic Service...  But the taste is worth compromising for the service.  In Short: Nice Food but service is extremely poor.
1.0,"Pathetic food and pathetic ambience! Punjabi songs playing in the restaurant will give you a headache and it only gets worse from there! Suffered from food poisoning after eating lunch there last afternoon, have been puking ever since. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go eat there! If you want to eat punjabi food I am sure you'll find another restaurant that doesn't send you to the hospital!"
3.5,"uff,, if only i could get seats here sooner :D :D  but the foods pretty great.. the mean the non-veg ones.. you wouldnt complain on any item, specially the starters are good. and yes, punjabi restaurant aye ho toh makke di roti and sarso da saag na bhuliyo... its great here :)  and yes its oily .. but thats how i prefer it to be :) .. somehow, i didnt like the paneer items we ordered.. it was too milky according to me(getting wat i mean? ) .. the service is quick . the price pretty decent... oh yeah, i feel the place is a lil dim.. not the romantic setting-a-mood kinda dim.. its less light kinda dim. i would prefer a lil more lights :D :D   Please visit once in a while, and ALERT- now matter how early you come or any wee hours , u have to wait :D :D :D  Food- 3.6/5 VFM- 4/5 (totally !) Ambience - 3.4/5( A lil more lights may be :) ) Service - 3.9/5"
4.0,"I have been regular to this place. They serve authentic punjabi food. Chicken starters are rich in flavor and taste. Kalmi Kabab, Malai Tikka are couple of starters of many to try out. In main course, the gravy dishes are given in good portion and gravy is tasteful and thick. Like side dishes they have long list of bread items like Amritsari Kulcha, Missi roti, Pudina Roti etc."
1.0,"I really like the food at this place. Good taste with cheap prices. But yesterday when I went, the washroom was in hell like condition. No flush and somebody's shit was floating around. I lost appetite.  I went to the manager and complained about this and his attitude about this whole incident was so callous. He seemed like he is just nodding to my words and not even paying attention. So after a lot of thought I am really sceptical about the hygiene of this place. I was with my GF and hence I didn't wanna make a fuss but later on I also found Anchaar plastic cover piece in my Chicken Achari. So think thrice before visiting here."
5.0,"Amazing place to dine in, thorughly enjoyed the food and the atmosphare. Must visit restaurant in Bangalor........ . Just make it quicker otherwise you guys are awsome. keep it up"
1.0,The restaurant has one of the worst home delivery timings in entire Indiranagar....an order for two took them 160 minutes to deliver...and no wonder the food tasted exactly what it should after it has been cooked and left in open for a very long time...and the way they test your patience by not picking up their only call available is the most irritating experience I had in a long time....Good luck is the only thing which I could tell you people if you are one of the unlucky ones who had to order from this place !!!!
1.5,"It was a great mistake that we selected this restaurant to hang around! We went for dinner (alacarte ). None of the dishes were good ! I don't know what kind of oil they used for green peas rice, it was stinking ! Price is also very high. We emptied our pockets by selecting this restaurant! Totally disappointed.."
4.0,"Honestly, i wasn't craving for some authentic punjabi food. But, I dunno why I was craving for tomato soup. In the same area, we went to adupadi, then kadai crust but in vain. So that's how I ended up at Punjabi rasoi while I was looking out for a very basic creamy tomota soup.  Went to this place yesterday for lunch basis the good review on zomato. Firstly, parking is definitely a issue here. After struggling to find some parking space, we headed to the restuatant . Wasn't much crowded on a friday afternoon.  My first order was definitely tomota soup :D and when it came as you can look in the pictures below...it looked sooooo good. Just the way I wanted. My first taste of it, and i was so disappointed. It just didn't taste anything. Totally tasteless. It was like water with some orangish red color and some bread crumbs. I immediately called the staff and told that it doesn't have any taste. He immediately got it replaced. And the second time, the tomota soup came to my table was delicious. I think he forgot to add some ingredient or something. But this time, it tasted super yummm. Just the way I wanted it. Then we ordered Chicken Tikka masala and butter phulka. The phulkas were soft and buttery. Yummm. The chicken tikka was lip smacking as well. No complaints on this one.  My overall experience with food was good here except fir the tomota soup. But again, the staff were good enough to get it replaced. Food here is worth the money.see Ambience is ok...just the a punjabi restuatant should be. The service here is excellent. My experience overall was wonderful here.  Food - 4/5 Service - 5/5 Ambience - 3.5/5"
4.0,"It's like an enchanted place out of a harry-potter novel, in the sense that the place is magically invisible even though it sits bang on the main road. More uninviting are the stairs that lead to to the seating area... And further disappointing is the dark dinghy seating. Some might still find it cozy romantic, but I am sure this place is ""magicked"" to appear thus. So if you are picky about ambience, you'd want to stay away, but of you enjoy good Punjabi cuisine, stay on. ""Makki di roti n sarson da saag""... Fabulous. Kebabs, awesome... The all-so-well-known ""chicken tikka masala"" simply mouth watering. Needless to say, I loved this joint. A word of caution, the other outlets (for e.g. HSR) are not as good. If you don't fret about parking space or ambience, this place is highly recommended."
4.0,Been ordering from the punjabi rasoi for years now. Yumm Dal makhani and butter chicken with naans. . Very simple restaurant. .but good punjabi food..
4.5,"I was bored of home made food. As a vegetarian and reluctant to travel more over a weekend, I zeroed in The Punjabi Rasoi for a Sunday dinner. We went there at pick time but the service delivery was so quick and satisfactory. The food was very good.   Around Indiranagrar, one should try this at least once, it won't disappoint your for sure."
3.5,"Now this is a place I like for the huge quantities, a portion of their curry would be more than enough for 2 FOODIES!!! Decent taste and good pricing! Apt for one of those lazy Sunday afternoons, when you want to stay at home and order in! Quick service too!"
4.5,The best punjabi food in Bangalore.. Non veg platter..paneer achari..sarso da saag..biryani..gulab jamuns..all these items are a must have here.!
4.5,"I heard a great deal about this place. always crowded, awesome punjabi food, average ambience, fast service. A must go if you are craving for authentic punjabi food."
5.0,"Craving for authentic Punjabi food.. Head to Punjabi Rasoi! Be it a delicacy in Paneer or Chicken everything is perfect. To accompany your gravy is 'The Butter Naan'-  butter is floating on the naan and you end up licking your fingers at the end of the meal. The hospitality and the service of the staff is to be highly appreciated. Also, aam panna here is definitely a no-miss. So, next time you crave for authentic north-indian food head to The Punjab Rasoi."
4.0,Wonderful food. Delicious starters. But it'll be much appreciated if they serve bigger portion of chicken pieces. I had a great time with my colleagues.
2.5,Disgusting is the one word....took more than 2 hours to deliver food..n on top of that they are charging 20 rupees for delivery n 20 rupees separately for packaging which really doesnt justify seeing their delivery effeciency....n they delivered wrong food as well..ordered kalmi kabab n they delivered rashmi kabab...really disgusted...
3.5,"Good destination for north indian food. Ambience is good ,waiters are good at their service. this is having large variety of punjabi as well as mughlai cuisine. If any one is planning to visit this restaurant then must try ""AAchari Chicken"" it is best ."
3.0,Softest paneer in town. Good punjabi taste. Too much crowded seems like eating at majestic bus stand.had paneer punjabi taste 4/5. Service is ok. must try green chutney.
4.5,"Food was awesome loved it, ordered Rada chicken and Paneer pasanda and both were upto the expectation.  Ambience was good.  Service was very bad, too slow and we needed to ask four times to re fill the water jug. Infact while billing we needed to ask more than once to get the bill.  Overall food was awesome which matters the most. Will be here again."
2.0,Food is good but turned out to be highly spicy despite requesting it to be less so. The waiter was taking care initially but later it was very difficult to get his attention.
4.5,The Punjabi Rasoi is my favourite place for authentic punjabi food in bangalore... Great food at a reasonable price just a little crowded at weekends....
4.0,"I was in Indiranagar for shopping and was craving for some good Punjabi food. When I checked zomato this place had good reviews. Since its not on the main road had to use the app to locate it. After struggling for parking went to the first floor and found the place. As you climb the stairs saw lot of folks waiting very crowded which meant that food is good...crowd puller. After waiting for 15mins found a place to sit by then hubby and I had decided what to order. No fancy place cutlery is steel, the ceiling is interesting its decorated with kites. Service was quick- we ordered tangdi kabab, tandoori gobhi, amritsari kulcha, lacha parata , kheema parata , mutter paneer, dal makhani & sweet lassi. Food was tasty but a bit oily. All this came up to 1700. Definitely recommended."
4.0,"One of the casual dining in Indrinagar,Was here previous Friday with my family.The Food is the real king.Butter chicken and biriyani was very good.A must visit place in indrinagar."
4.5,"Being from Calcutta, i have pretty high expectations from places claiming to serve good north indian. This place satisfied my expectations for really good north indian food. The sabzis tasted amazing, with just the right amount of spices. Amritsari kulchas were great, so were the phulkas. Quantities were generous and very decently priced. Ambience and service are good, nothing too fancy or extraordinary.  I now know where to go when craving some delicious north indian food."
4.5,"By far the best punjabi food i had in bangalore. Few good menu sekections to try out: Missi roti which has a little flavour of daal Aam pana, a great couple with punjabi food Chicken lababdar"
4.5,If you want to eat some awesome North Indian food this is the place to go. We ordered Lasooni Chicken Tikka for starters which was mind blowing. For the main course we took Chicken Lababdar which was divine. The place is easy on the wallet but great on taste. The decor is quite mediocre but that should not deter you from visiting the place. This place was crowded when we reached there so expect a waiting time of about 15-20 minutes. Definitely worth a visit more than once.
2.5,The food is awesome. But the service is sub standard.
4.5,If u like north indian food u will definitely like this place... Every week i go there and try new chicken items and each and every one is too good. One of our favourite is chicken roganjosh.
4.0,"Butter chicken here is super awesome, pair it with some chicken Afghani and garlic naan and you wouldn't need anything else. Really loved the chaas here as well."
4.5,"Affordable. Good quantity of food. Paneer achaari is a special in starters.... It's really good. I also tried soya roti, garlic naan and makki ki roti. My friend had ordered chicken keema. The malai kofta had really big pieces of pander. And it tasted also good. The hotel doesn't look good from outside. But inside the servicing was really good."
3.5,"Nominal charges, good quantity, food is a little oily but have nice pubjabi taste. Must visit if you're a Punjabi or a North Indian. Ambience is not so good, but attracts a good number of visitors on weekends."
4.0,I would rate 0.5 more as it was pocket friendly . I had only Veg so rated according but non-veg is also a good deal here. I would like to suggest this restaurent toa punjabifood lover.
4.5,This restaurant serves the most amazing punjabi food in bangalore. The price is also very reasonable. And the quality of food is always maintained. Highly recommend you all to try afghani chicken and chicken chaat for starters. Absolutely brilliant. Decor not that great. Must visit place this.
4.0,Always crowded so I suggest you order in. The ambience is functional. But the food is the real star here! Found the listing on Zomato so decided to try. And what a find! The Biriyani is memorable and so is the rada chicken.  Do try!..
4.5,"If you are looking for authentic north Indian taste,this is the place to go for. Reach before 8 30 if you hate waiting for table. What is good: sarson ka saag(best so far in bangalore) Makhani dal Missi rotti Aam panna Quantity of food Homelike mango pickle and sirka pyaaz served along your order They don't charge fancy taxes(just 4 percent of your order) What is bad: lassi and butter milk will dissapoint you Bit hard to find for first timers  Ambience 4/5 Taste 4.5/5 Value for money 5/5 Service 5/5 Overall restaurant is awesome and won't dissapoint your pocket and taste buds :)"
4.0,"There are some restaurants that leave a lasting impression on your mind and this place certainly did that! The strongest point of this resto is the Food. What else does one need? I heard a great deal about this place and decided to check for myself. As they say, you cannot judge a book by its cover. From the outside, it doesn't look like hep happening place. Neither does it look like that from the inside. The interiors is decent and nothing too fancy. The place is always full and one can end up waiting for a good 15-20 mins for getting a table. Coming to the FOOD! I had the best achari chicken here. Trust me, all the items are delectable. None of the items disappointed me. The kadai mushroom, the paneer malamaal was what we ordered and they were better than the non veg. They even offer a wide variety of breads. If you are bored with the normal Naan, kulcha, roti etc then you can opt for soya roti, makki roti, pudina paratha etc. Not many places offer so many options especially in Indian breads.  Overall this place is the perfect place for lunches and dinners. One of the few places in bangalore which offer authentic Punjabi food."
4.0,"Truely one of the best outlet for north indian food.  Also, the portions were huge.  Ambiance : 3.5/5 Taste : 4.5/5 Value for Money : 4/5 PS: Don't try Lassi you will be disappointed"
4.5,"The journey to this place started first time on my birthday,  my treat was there as most of my friends are north indians and love Indian cuisine; and it has been only 3 months since my birthday and we have already gone there more than thrice!!!! I am just in deep love with their food;especially their chicken starters!!!!!! Chicken kalmi kabab and chicken malai tikka are my personal favourites.... For all the desi food lovers this is definetly a place to visit in Bangalore!!"
4.5,"My friend gave me farewell party and after long time I ate authentic North India food after Sanjhi Dopahar in bangalore at amazing tasy. Butter chicken, dal makhni, mutter paneer, chicken biryani everything was yum. In desserts we tried flavoured lassi and we were very disappointed with the taste. Apart from flavoured lassi ,food was well cooked though we waited long for our order to reach to our table... Definately will recommend this place"
5.0,"In love with this place! This is one of those few places I wouldn't mind repeating. Every time I am in Indiranagar and super hungry with an urge to have good Indian cuisine, this place is where I want to be.  The food is pretty oily but tastes brilliant. Perfect for the Indian palette. Ambience is decent but there are too many tables for the space they have. If you are looking for some really good north Indian food, do not miss this place!"
4.0,"Delicious punjabi food with nice ambience at cheap price.Service is very quick. Paneer lababdar,lassi and stuffed kulcha are must haves here."
4.0,One who is foodie can't miss to get in here. Food is so tasty that u would just on ordering ordering and ordering . Chicken and paneer are too soft and tender in taste.
5.0,"If you want lip-smacking, delicious north indian food, this is the place to be. We love to end our weekends by having a sumptous sunday dinner here. The lassi here is something that I cannot say no to. The best part is that after relishing all the food, it does not make a big hole in the pocket!"
4.0,"It is little difficult to locate this place in Indiranagar. I just visited this place with my friend last week on the recommendation of my other friends for punjabi food.   If you really wanted to try authentic punjabi food, please do visit this place. You will love this. We ordered Jaljeera, Achari Paner, Dal Makkani, Soyabeen, Butter Nan, Garlic Nan, Laccha Paratha & Lassi.   Starter Achari Paneer, Dal Makkani and Lassi was delicious & must try dishes. Butter Nan was too oily and heavy but tasty. Other dishes were also good except Soyabeen was ok.  Ambience is ok and different with various colors kites pasted on ceiling.  Service was very fast. I would liked like to visit this place again and wanted to try some other dishes."
1.0,"Saw the reviews and ordered . It takes more than 90 mins for home delivery. A wrong choice for home delivery... Very disappointed with the response when asked about the delay. It's hospitality industry, guess being courteous Will help...."
4.0,"I have been to this place multiple times (at least 50 times :-) ). My favorite here is the chicken chaat. I loved this starter from the beginning. Other dishes are also good like paneer achaari, rajma masala, naans etc.... I hale from north India so I am fond of Punjabi cuisine and this is the place.  Overall ratings: Food :- 4/5  Serving :- 3.5/5  Ambiance :- 3/5  Price :- 4/5"
5.0,"Best Indian food in Bangalore. Period. Their Chicken Lababdar will leave you licking your fingers. Mouth watering, delicious, absolutely delightful food. When you want spicy Indian, you have to go to Punjabi Rasoi"
4.0,"Lazy sunday afternoon and looking for a not-so-expensive place to eat at in Indiranagar, Punjabi Rasoi is there to your rescue. I went here yesterday with 5 other friends and was quite happy with my experience here.  We ordered chicken lababdar and chicken punjabi along with kulcha and naans which were quite good. Also, the portions were huge. The items were true to the Punjabi cuisine but Lassi was a major disappointment. Ambiance : 3.5/5 Taste         : 4.5/5 Value for Money : 4/5 Shivam Singh Saurav Singh"
4.0,Have gone here often. I love the place. the dishes are really great and reasonably priced with good quantity. Especially panner fry is really wow......
3.5,Good food value for money! Taste was good. Definitely recommend for delivery/dine in.  Ambience is nice and cozy. They have maximized on the seating space with basic interiors.  Value for money - 4/5 Ambience - 3.5/5 Taste - 3.5/5 Service - 3/5
4.0,"Delicious food, great service; good place to be with family. You can even grab a pan, among many choices, at the doorstep of the restaurant."
4.0,"I have lost count of the number of times I've been to this place. This is one of the places in Bangalore that you can always count on for good authentic Punjabi food and that too at a very reasonable and economic price for a place like Indiranagar. If you want good north Indian food and are not bothered by a bit too much of butter in your naan, you will definitely love this place. Chicken dishes are great here and so are the veg ones, although I have tried very few of the veg dishes. They also give really good portions for the prices they charge. Irrespective of what time or what day I have visited or ordered from this place, it has never failed to deliver. Ambiance wise also it is pretty decent and good for all groups of people. Their ceiling is covered with kites which is pretty unique and worth checking out at least once. If you are looking for a place to hog on good north Indian (veg or non-veg) food to your heart's content and at the same time not burn a hole in your pocket, this is definitely a place I'd recommend."
4.0,Tasty food.You get the real taste of punjab.Ambience is not good.Need to wait for long if you do not reserve table.Hospitality is not that great.But you will definitely visit the place more than once for its food.
4.0,The food was good - very authentic and very homely. It felt like a genuine north indian restaurant in bangalore. The service however could have been better. It was not rude or anything but just that it felt mechanical and not personal. But worth a visit for the food !
4.0,"A Place to ReReReRe....Visit  Been here quite a few times. Dosent matter small groups , Big groups , Alone or whatever. If you are looking for some really good North Indian Food and don't want to spend much, THIS IS THE PLACE.  Food is quite good, sometimes you may need to ask them to run low on spices but delicious always.  On the downside, any weekend you are sure to find a long line even int he late hours, but it makes up for it with the food and service.  Service is quite freindly and fast, and the waiters generally know the dishes well, so that's a Plus ++.  Ambiencewise it is not striking but comfortable. A little noisy at times but hey everyone is cheerful and loud when having good food, so cant balme it on them.  Overall, its a place to eat and is really good at that !!!"
3.5,"If you are a NorthIndian food lover, you need to visit this place. The food is really good, affordable. I found this place a bit small for the crowd but then why worry for something else if the food is awesome.   The non-veg dishes are really worth trying. The kabaabs were super tender and juicy from inside. You tend to eat 3-4 starter if you go as a couple.   Do try the Lassi, its good but yes can be better from my personal experience. I would suggest to book a table if you are going on a weekend. Peak time you know.   Overall rating :-  Food :- 4/5 Serving :- 3/5 Ambiance :- 3/5 Price :- 4/5"
4.0,"There was a time when this place was my weekend Adda. Me and my room mate use to visit this place on every weekend to have an authentic punjabi food. yes its oily and spicy but that's how a real dhaba style food gets prepared.  The food is simply awesome and it tastes really great.  Both veg and non veg is great and this is the place to have great North Indian food in bangalore. It is difficult to point out few dishes from its menu as most of the dishes are  good in taste and portioning. But dont try biryani as its not one of their best item.  Service is too fast which is good and bad at a same time. they should work on their ambiance, as its just ok ok.  Ambiance 3  Food 4.5  Service 4 Overall 4"
4.0,Amongst the best place in Bangalore if u want to enjoy your food. The place is always crowded so its advisable to book your table well in advance. The ambience is nothing great but its so pocket friendly dat u can visit dis place every week ;)Service is quick and waiters are friendly. Love dis place and would love to visit it again :)
3.5,"Must visit if you r looking for authentic Punjabi food near indranagar!! We ordered veg sheen kabab and it was ok but onion parathas, paneer butter n lassi were delicious!! Aam Dana was very tasty over all loved the food!!"
4.0,"Awesome and delicious food for sure. This is one place that we visit at least 2-3 times a month. Always crowded, whichever day of the week that you pick up.  Ambiance is okay. Fun to be in a huge group to enjoy the sumptuous food being served !  Flip side: Waiting time.  My advice would be to book your table well in advance, whatever may be your group size.  Must try: Chicken Kebab Platter, Chicken Butter Masala, Kashmiri Naan. Biriyani served also has the right aroma to satisfy your gastronomic experience!"
1.0,"My rating is 1 coz there isn't an option for 0....as simply put as that....I have gone through a few other comments regarding the rude behaviour of the owners of this place. Wish I had read it before odering. I had this craving for Punjabi food. That was the awful time when I decided to order from here. I had ordered for Chicken curries and naan and rotis.  There was this peculiar smell from the rotis and chicken. It was almost like some carbide in it. To make some things clear first I had served one piece each from the curries and half naan and roti. Take a note of this sentence. It will gain importance in the coming sentences. I called up the restaurant and told them that the food was smelling. He very politely told me that we will collect it back and refund the money.  This man comes and smells the food....No Ma'am it does not stink is the answer I get. Really dude....I told him have a bite and u will know. Then he opens the Butter Chicken and tells me that there is just one piece left u have eaten all....I tried explaining that I had ordered for a four piece curry and olny one was taken out from each of the curries and me and my friend had bitten it so I threw it. He called up his owner I guess. He explained to me that I should have kept the bitten pieces back in the container. This is a certain protocol that they follow...My God I just felt like laughing my heart out. Dude u want those bitten pieces. So I asked the gentleman to take it out from the dustbin and satisfy his doubts. I opened the box and counted three pieces in front of him.  Then he was like okay Ma'am just leave it. I told him keep the 500(bill amount) as a tip....Don't think money here is the question. Once the pieces were shown he was all set to leave asap. What an experience and what people. All I could do that day was slam the door and yell on the phone.  Trust me its a waste of time, energy and money. Bunch of ill-mannered people all at one place.  Disguisting place to order food. If by any chance u get stinky or bad food, be prepared to bang ur head on the wall (Well Almost) !!"
4.5,One of the best Punjabi food I have eaten in Bangalore... The panner here is too die for.. It's just so soft that of melts in the mouth... My husband loves the chicken nargisi..
1.0,"These people have reduced the quality of food sizeably.  I used to visit this restaurant almost every week,  and today I found the food really bad. When I reported it to owner, he didn't care and asked me to put whatever I want on zomato. He even said he doesn't care about customers and forums like zomato.  He is just concerned with money....  guys think before you go to this place now... m not visiting it anymore"
4.5,"One word for it ""amazing"". I will not doubt calling it one of the best Punjabi food outlets in Bangalore. Good menu...yummy food...pocket friendly..decent ambience. Best for family lunch or dinner. Service : 4/5 Food :4.9999 /5 Price:4.5/5 Loved the chicken seekh kebab, it was quite different and yummmm. Achari paneer was worth a try. Even main course was better than most of the Punjabi restaurants I have visited. mango pickle ...it was just wow. Will keep visiting..."
4.5,"The Place: An inconspicuous average looking building wedged between other average looking buildings; even if you were given the street address there's a good chance you would need more than one pass to locate it. But the interiors of the building are definitely more welcoming and somewhat cosy, and pleasantly noisy owing to the ever-present crowd.  The Food: As Punjabi as it can get, the food can definitely be among the top contenders for most authentic and delicious north indian food in Bangalore in the mid-price range. Generous use of spices and milk derivatives coupled with skilled culinary produce a mouth-watering, aroma-rich food that will just stretch your appetite to the point of gluttony.The standard Butter chicken and Sweet lassi are must-haves. Kebabs and Paneer dishes are also above average."
4.5,"Just awesome food... One would have to wait for good amount of time on weekends... Wait is worth for the food you get to eat... Service also is slow, may be because of weekend rush but good and courteous service."
4.5,"Tucked away in one of the bylanes of 100 feet road, Indiranagar, this place serves some of the best Punjabi food I have tasted in Bangalore. A non-descript staircase leads to this gem of a place, and it's actually easy to miss unless you know what exactly you are looking for. Maybe a bigger board is what's missing.   We have ordered food via home delivery more number of times than we have actually been here. The butter naan - chicken butter masala combo has been our go-to diet on many a nights - when friends came over, when we were in the mood for something spicy, or when we were just too lazy to venture out. And of the few times we have been there in person, we found the kababs and the lassi to complement the main course pretty well.  Easily one of the most pocket friendly eateries in the city, this place is worth a visit for any foodie. The interior isn't very fancy, although, in all fairness, they have gone imaginative in the use of kites to decorate the ceiling. So don't expect an extravagant ambience here; go just for the love of food."
4.0,"We had been wanting to go here for some time, but just never couldn't.... Finally found an opportunity tonight (parents' silver jubilee) and wow, were we surprised! The entrance is quite nondescript, looked more like a bar entrance actually. We went in, and lo and behold, the place is quite zazzy. A ceiling stuck with kites of all colours and sizes, low intensity lighting (gave a peaceful atmosphere). The plates were made of steel but had an old school kind of feel to it. In fact, all the utensils were like that. Also, another interesting fact, they served water in these jugs that had half a lemon and some mint leaves. Helped in cleansing the palette. But the music was a little bit too loud. Now, the food. Usually, we have non-veg, but decided to go for veg. Ordered the tomato soup and baby corn tandoori. Soup was really creamy, and just a hint of spice. The croutons were big and remained crisp until the end (sign of freshly made croutons). The tandoori was quite hot and spicy. But accompanied with the mint chutney, was bearable. The good part was that they used really less oil, which I love. Next came the main courses. Navratan korma and veg kofta. Both were brilliantly made, with the right amount of spice, heat and sweetness. The korma had big chunks of malai (that was softer than paneer but had the same consistency), and had the right amount of sweetness, not too overpowering but maintaining the essence of the korma (Navratan korma is a sweet dish). The veg kofta was slightly spicy, but the heat was spot on, not too hot. Again, very less oil used, but that might be because of the amount of cream they put in almost everything. Also, an interesting point, they put elaichi (cardamom) in all the dishes, from the soup to the tandoori to the main courses. The rotis were good, cooked right, not burnt at all, just the right amount of crispness. Didn't have place for rice, so skipped that part and went straight to the desert. Ordered gulab jamun. The jamun was heavenly. Like, straight from the platter of God. It was served hot, with syrup, and two round, perfectly cooked golden brown (and cooked through!) jamuns in a bowl. End result, completely happy. Food: 9/10 Ambience: 8/10 Service: 9/10 (call the head waiter, not his lackeys) Value for money: 6/10"
3.0,"We decided to visit The Punjabi Rasoi on a friend's recommendation.   After telling us how amazing the place is, he did give us 1 warning - The portions are quite big.  So we tried to keep our order small.  Here's what we had -  Appetizer -   Afghani Chicken  Gravy -  Chicken Do Pyaaza  Chicken Methi Malai  Bread-  Tandoori Rotis  Garlic Naans  Amritsari kulchas  Drinks-  Punjabi Sweet Lassi  Punjabi Mango Lassi  The appetizer arrived really fast, and I must say I was impressed. The chicken was well marinated in yogurt, cream & spices and finally cooked in a tandoor. This dish stole the show.  The main course took a while to arrive and we sipped our Punjabi Sweet Lassi while we waited - Which I must say was superb! Haven't had a lassi like this elsewhere that I can remember.  The Chicken Do Pyaaza and Chicken Methi Malai were both great! The rotis were all delicious too.  And yes, my friend was right -  The portions are quite big; The food is also very rich.  Finally to top it all off, we had a Punjabi Mango lassi. I liked the Sweet lassi was better.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have some authentic Pubjabi food.  Food - 3.5/5 Service - 3/5 Ambiance - 2/5"
1.0,"Horrible... All starters taste the same and uncooked (order Kalmi and Tangri Chicken) both r same no taste with some thick cream on it.. When asked ""Dont care"" response from waiter. This place was good earlier but not anymore. Main course was equally bad.. Even the jaljeera!!! shame for a punjabi restraurant."
5.0,"This is the place that you will never be bored off and you will keep coming again and again.   It has great food supported with great ambiance. All walls decorated with Kites makes you remind of your childhood.  This place serves both vegetarian and non vegetarian but that does not mean that vegetarians will feel for granted,  Their dal tadka is to die for, and the veg tikka masala is a great soya bean dish, YOu will almost get confused it with paneer.  you have great option for rotis.  This is great and all time favorite place that has great food complimented with fantastic quick service"
3.5,"We had dinner at Punjabi Rasoi in Indiranagar. The ambience was okay but a bit noisy. The kites on the ceiling and the utensils they serve in, gives the restaurant a North Indian touch. The service was quick. There was a long queue waiting outside on Sunday dinner time.  In starters we tried chicken chat, malai chicken tikka and paneer tikka. Chicken tikka was quite good, paneer tikka was fine but chicken chat was not what we expected.  In the main course, we had Punjabi mutton which was decent. Malai kofta was a bit sweet for our liking. Chicken kali mirch was delicious. Stuffed keema parantha  was also prepared nicely.  In deserts, kheer and gulab jamun both were both good.  Food - 3.5/5  Ambiance - 3/5 Service - 4/5 VFM - 4/5"
4.5,"One of my favorite north indian restaurants in Bangalore...Dal Makhni, Butter Chicken and Chicken Do Pyaza are my favorites. Lassi and Masala coke are also worth trying."
4.0,I personally liked the place very much.. Delicious punjabi .. North indian food.. And pretty good ambiance too...  Price wise its very decent.. Good option for a casual dinner or lunch..
4.0,Amazing starters especially chicken afghani and literally mouth watering non veg gravies.... Good crowd... Rice items are good but could be better... But then the raita they give with it is yummmm... You can eat anything with that kind of heavenly raitha.... It's a must visit place and an unforgettable taste....
4.0,"If you are in and around Indiranagar and are craving some awesome Punjabi food, then Punjabi Rasoi definitely tops the list. Located near the RTO on the  first floor, on the same road which has bow barracks, Chettiars this place serves very good food. This place is usually very crowded during the evenings and finding a place might take you some food waiting time.  The bhindi curry and panneer butter mandala here is one of our personal favourites followed by some awesome Jal Jeera and you have that satisfied happy look on the face.  The pricing here is a tad bit expensive but definitely worth visiting for some good yummy and spicy food.   Rating -  4/5 BUDGET -  800 for 2                                                                 lohith1509.blogspot.com"
3.5,"This place is good for Punjabi-food enthusiasts. It provides some well-cooked north Indian food, veg as well as non-veg for a decent price. It would definitely help if they add variety to their menu, as that is the only spice they lack.  Their starters are definitely tasty. More importantly, the paneer was well-cooked. Many restaurants find it easy to mess up their paneer dishes. Some of my friends recommended the Tawa chicken. They weren't wrong. Same goes for the Paneer Pasanda. Other recommendations include Nargisi tikka and Makki di roti with Sarson ka saag. Overall, it was a pleasant meal. A pan-waala sits just outside the restaurant door. So, that's a very traditionally sweet ending to the meal.  I haven't rated it 4, because- 1. Too cramped and noisy, 2. Inconvenient location, you are very likely to miss it for the first time, 3. Nothing out of the box, except for, probably, the innumerable kites adorning the ceiling."
4.5,Really a nice place for starters and main course. If you want to try it please go for Chicken Chat and rahda chicken.. Your pallet will be delighted with the awesome taste of chicken chat.. For its a place where I would like to everyday for starters..
4.5,If you like a pure Punjabi dhaba food don't look out for any other place. One can try Veg or Non-Veg both are good.  Situated close to Indranagar BDA complex.
3.5,"A place worth visiting for north Indian food. Do visit if you don't mind calories. Food to be tried here. - Nargishi Chicken, well cooked in Indian white sauce ;) - Chicken Chat, simply superb - Dal Makhani, One of rare in Bangalore - Lassi , heavy - Keema naan, well cooked with good stuffing.  Other dishes are good too and worth giving a try. Ambience if different with kites and service can be improved upon. On pocket its OK ."
3.5,"I have been there thrice, twice for a dine-in, once for a takeaway (because the restaurant was full and the waiting list was fairly long). The dine-in experience was good:waiters were attentive, pricing was fine, place was a bit crowded but that was expected. The restaurant was a bit difficult to locate though. The takeaway was a disppointment though. We ordered sarson da saag and some paneer gravy (I don't remember). By the time we reached home, it had become a bit cold. The sarson da saag tasted bland and there was a thick layer of oil above the paneer gravy and it did not taste that good either.  So my 3.5 rating goes mainly for the decor, service and ambience. Food and pricing are ok."
4.0,This has been a regular for us for quite a while. This is a authentic North Indian cuisine. Food is nice and place is mostly filled with people. On a weekend it's generally crowded.   Ambience: 0.7/1 Service:  0.7/1 Value for money: 0.8/1 Food: 1.8/2 Total: 4/5
4.0,Superb place for authentic North Indian food. Like they say 'Asli Desi Ghar Ka Khana' and they are bang on.  Have been there a couple of times and the last one was with my veggie parents. Even they loved the food there. The stuff is extremely fresh with tender paneer and chicken.  Highly recommended
5.0,If you're really hungry and want to eat delicious food. Punjabi rasoi is the right place to go. The food is absolutely delicious. The ambience of this place pleasant. Each and every dish is delicious.
4.0,"Have never dined here but have been ordering from here. Good punjabi food, chicken bharta is really nice. Initially starters seemed good but later felt they could improve that as in make it a bit dry. Afghani and Nargisi are good."
3.5,"I give 3.5 for this one It's one of the finest place in indira nagar if you are looking for some good punjabi food. it's little crowded, location is not that good but you can excuse all the drawbacks once you start having their butter chicken and tandoori roti. I have tasted their tandoori chicken, rotis, butter chicken, kadai paneer, mushrooms and many more. I didn't like the biryanis but rest all the dishes are tasty. The prices are ok ok not expensive for what they serve. My suggestion is they should take steps to make the restaurant more visible."
4.5,"Best Authentic Punjabi food I have ever had. They try to make the ambience look like sky filled with kites. Different concept but could be more creative. Service is little slow but the place is clean and waiters are welcoming.Murg Achari Tikka,Mutton (all dishes),chicken Lababdar,panner tikka,parathas,chicken Afgani and last but not the least their Lassi are must ordered items. Place is little in hiding as its in the first floor and could advertise more. :) Nagada Paneer is a MUST TRY here.. Manoj Parida Akash Mohanty"
3.0,Good punjabi food joint!! The service can improve a lot as it's not the quickest!! The food is good on a whole and priced decently!! There is good competition around Indiranagar for punjabi food joints and this joint is up there competing with it!
2.0,"The best place to head to if you love splurging money on bland, odourless and colourless Biryani which, instead of satisfying your hunger, makes you go to a temple to wash off all your sins."
4.0,"Very good food and ambience! But, food is a bit too oily.. The paneer is really soft and nice.. Typical punjabi types :) ANd the pricing too is decent!  Otherwise, a really nice place with good service :)"
4.0,A better experience than the one in HSR.. Ambiance is a little let down.. But food is lip smacking... Service is promp... Every dish has a distinct flavour ...
3.5,"went here on a friday evening. Restaurant was full, waited for 30mins and left .. came here early the next day and luckly got a seat. we tried chicken chaat, chicken achari for starters.. chicken patiyala and chicken hyderbadi along with different varities of roti/naan for main course.. completely satisfied with food.. quantity is more than avg so order slowly.. nice ambiance.. bit hard to locate.."
5.0,"Awesome food ambience has to be work out with but then too managable.. But quality of the food is awesome totally for an epicure without thinking about the pocket weight. One should give taste to their taste buds from ""THE PUNJABI RASOI"" PUNJABI PANEER AND PUNJABI CHICKEN both were awesome.."
3.5,"Authentic Punjabi food and the special Chicken chat will make you forget the best of chicken you have had in Bangalore.Not sure how it turns up for veggies, but hopefully that should also be good.The wait for table is 15 minutes minimum and at times the waiter might take time to attend you. So instead of waiting for someone to attend to you, better ask the waiters yourself to take order.The Rahra chicken is my favourite main course and drinks are also good here.Did not rate this outlet too high because the outlet at R.T Nagar is the best in all aspects."
1.0,"I ordered food to be delivered at home and this is the 2nd time the service is very bad. I agree the food is good and not that great but taking 2 hours to deliver food is ridiculous. They either should consider stopping delivery service or close the restaurant period. And when you call them to check on the order, they just keep the phone busy and can not be reached for more than 15 minutes.  Here are the details:  7:50 PM- placed an order for 2 veg gravies and paratha. They said the order will take 45 mins to 1 hour. So I informed them not to delay further. 8:50 PM- The order was still not delivered. Rain had started by now. 9:00 PM- I call them to check on the order and he said rain had started and it will take another 10 mins. BTW the house is literally less than 10 mins from the restaurant. From 9:15-9:45 I have been trying to reach the restaurant and unfortunately no response. Busy all the time. I finally got through the mobile number found online and informed that we no longer require the order since its delayed by more than 1.5 hours. 9:58- The order arrives and refused to take the order.  Good luck Punjabi Rasoi for your business. Not sure how far you are gonna last if you keep continuing such poor service. May be folks who are really desperate to eat Punjabi food and don't mind waiting for 2 hours can be your customers."
4.5,"My favorite place when I miss punjabi food. Activate ur google maps because it is a little hard to locate.Once there though, u cannot miss the kites that make up the ceiling or the punjabi feel of it  My favorite is afghani chicken and butter paneer.They also have a famous chicken chat but i do not really like it.It is however the favorite of a few of my friends. Do not miss on the lassi once you are done eating. Also u might want to grab a magai paan on the way out.The only thing that comes to my mind is MIAM MIAM;)"
4.0,"One excellent place totry out some good Punjabi food. A bit hard to locate though(as it is off the 100ft Road).The ambiance of the place was good. You have the entire ceiling wrapped up with kites and other materials. The walls have photographs and artifacts that will bring the feel of a good punjabi joint. Although, you might find the place a bit conjested.The food was very good. To start with the starters, the kalmi kabab and chicken tikka did impact the taste buds . Moving on the mains, the rotis were awesome along with the sides . The quantity was more than what you might expect. So better you order slowly at first, and then proceed.Overall:-FOOD-4/5 AMBIANCE-3.5/5 SERVICE-3.5/5"
4.0,"Punjabi Rasoi is on the road perpendicular to Indiranagar BDA Complex. As you enter the 1st floor you'll be welcomed by a Paanwala at the entry. Ambiance is made a lil colorful with kites and some wall hangings but still has a dim effect and more or less appears as a normal restaurant. But the main highlight is their Food, authentic Punjabi food which would make you come back again. Lassi is good but not as good as Oye Amritsar but the roti and the gravies are to die for!!! All this at a reasonable price makes this place a hit...."
4.0,"Good food at reasonable price... Chicken Chaat, Chikken Tikka Masala and Butter Naan are my usual take aways.."
1.0,Had ordered food for home delivery today.Pathetic food....Loaded with oil and salt!! Had ordered for lassi too but it ws already spilled in the carry bag. The delivery boy said to pay the whole amount (including lassi) and that he would go back and get it in 15 minutes but he never came back. Whoever takes the order on call is also very rude. Bad experience. I am never going to order the food again from here.
4.0,For me ut was the first restaurant in Bangalore to have authentic north-Indian dishes to be served. I just loved the dishes and its menu.
2.0,I ordered mutton curry on last Saturday..food was not very tasty... And quantity was also less. And it was delivered after almost one n half hours... Not very satisfied????
2.0,"Finding the place itself is a pain in the ass! You feel you are close to the place but, it just irritates you to the core not to see the place. Half the tasting buds go dead after, looking out for this place. The food is just decent enough, while the behavior of the staff just adds a final nail in the coffin. Overall don't try this place, unless its the last place to hog in!!"
3.5,"Nice joint great food, nice ambiance. Getting a place become quiet a wait during weekends. Tandoor starters are really good, creamy and juicy. Have been going there for the past 7 years, of late the restaurant has become a bit pricey, else no complaints its very good. Highly recommended."
3.5,"KABABS & LASSI! The only reason why i would visit this place again and again! The Ambience is pretty okay, and the service is good. The Food here is really amazing! From the Achari Tikka to The Sheekh Kabab! The food is really tasty! They have Flavoured Lassi as well. The prices are very moderate and would come upto around 400 bucks per person approximately. The Dal Makhani and Butter Chicken is a delight!  Ambience: 7/10. Food: 8/10. Service: 7/10. Value For Money: 7/10"
3.5,"We had been more than 2 times times. Not so expensive, Food has that Punjabi flavor. We liked the Afghan Chiken & nagir kabab. Rotis were good too. But lassi was the worst thing that we should have tried. Lassi was very sour inspite of adding sugar. Ambience is not so good. Circulation of air is poor. During summer Its like sitting in an oven."
3.5,"food is good... dal makhni, chicken achari r worth to try.. service is lil slow ..ambiance isn't grt.)"
5.0,"If you want good quality food at an justifiable price, then this is the place for you. Service is excellent and the taste is mouth watering."
3.5,"Value for money!!! The food was splendid.I was really impressed by their service, one of the best I have seen. Quantity of food was excellent compatible to the cost. Ambience of the place is good. What it lacked was in cutlery as food was served in normal steel plates.One more thing if possible get your table reserved in advance as it's crowded on weekends so one might have to wait outside for table. It's not at all posh place but a normal north Indian Restaurant."
4.5,"One the best North Indian restaurant in Bangalore....... I'm from Punjab n after being 2 months in Bangalore hustling around for good Punjabi food...I finally found one.  The food there is fabulous, service is quick n the staff is friendly. The best thing there is their Lassi."
4.5,"I had been looking for a place where food actually tastes like it does in the north. Lucky I found this. I think I had the best Dal Makhni in Bangalore till date here! I think all dishes and the lassi was great. Definitely going there again! With a decent price range and perfect taste, it won our hearts."
2.0,"This is take-away kind of restaurant, where the quality/taste of the food doesnt matter much Ordered vegetarian dishes nothing was good, not even the rotis, needless to say about the overpriced menu. Disliked:- Taste of all the dishes ordered.Overpriced menuPathetic Service"
3.0,visting punjabi rasoi on a weeeknd for a dinner without booking would be complete waste of time as you have to wait in queue .. Achari chicken is worth giving a try.
4.0,"Authentic punjabi food.  Must try is  sarson  da saag ,makki  di  roti  or missi roti Value for money. This place is fully packed  in  weekends and you may  have  wait  for 30-40 mins"

4.0,Very nice and light food
4.5,"Not every restaurant provides the spiceyness inna north Indian curries , but they did and I loved every bite here . have been here trice and every time they have delivered a great taste in all the varieties I have tried .  The only con I would say is , they r way too fast in providing service and don't wait to provide starters main course and desert on the right time ...as soon as u order they r there in front of u and it up to u how u have them ..slow and cold. Or hot and fast"
4.0,"The restaurant have OK ambiance but the food is so tasty, you forget about everything else. This is the place if you really want to enjoy really delicious north indian food. Although they put lot of oil/butter in gravy but who cares if you really appreciate the taste of the food. So yummy so tasty."
3.0,"On my last visit to Bangalore, i paid a visit to Punjabi Rasoi. The food is yummy and gives the flavor of authentic punjabi food like any other north indian restaurants and that too in south india. I would love to go more to this restaurant when i am in the city!  Best Luck to the staff of this Punjabi Restaurant !"
4.0,Awesome Food and light on pocket!! Definitely a must visit!
3.5,Have ordered food from them countless time from office. The portion size is good and the price is also reasonable. The Afghani Chicken is finger licking good. They serve tasty and authentic punjabi and mughlai kind of cuisine!
1.0,"Giving the worst rating . The key to successful business is the way you communicate to the customers. The owner of this restuarsnt is highly impolite and the tone is very rude. Even for the home-delivery, they will simply nod their head in a condescent manner which leaves a very bad impression.   I have been there a couple of times, even the waiters shall not listen to you and the service is extremely slow. The tables stinks at times even after the guy cleans them up. After all this happens to you do you still wanna tastes food ?   One more thing i noticed there that the curd they server is more of cream and not curd. C'mon, everybody knows the difference between curd and cream.   People, please beware about the owner and i am not at all Happy with him.  hope this helps someone."
3.0,"The Punjabi Rasoi in Indiranagar is better than the one in HSR layout, they seem to have a better and cleaner place than the HSR layout branch. Food wise they are ok - not bad and not good. It is a very average place. Cost wise also they are average. Been to this place couple of times and it was ok for budget lunch. The ambiance is nothing to talk about. This place is like a normal north indian restaurant.  Verdict: It is ok for a takeaway, this will be a last place in my dining list. A very average place."
4.5,Very nice ambience.. The best Punjabi food I ever had..I have visited this place thrice and my experience was very good..we ordered sarso da saag and makki ki roti once..it was amazing..even Punjabi paneer was awesome.. Paneer was so soft and fresh that it just melts once you put it in your mouth..though it is a crowded place service is really very good..best place for Punjabi food lovers
5.0,"I make sure I visit a place 3 times before reviewing it. And banging a 5 all 3 times is a huge deal for a no-fancy, simple place like this. Ambience - Clean and simple with the roof covered with kites. Staff - Im sure the staff has its own mix of people but yet to hear a bad experience from anyone. I go and ask for Ram bhaiyya, hes just too good as suggestions and would do whatever variation you want in the food. For eg. On asking about the less butter on the naan he got a bowl of butter to the table and kept apologizing for it :D Prices - Innovative pricing with options of 4,6,12 pieces for chicken. For the price they charge, there is no better place in Bangalore that serves North Indian food that good. Food - Where do I even start!! Reach there, take the menu card, close your eyes and just place the finger on a dish and it will be perfectly amazing!!! My fav 'Chicken Lababdar' and the 'Afgani kabab'. Their roti/naan/paratha assortment is delightful!!  Till I have a below par experience, this place deserves the 5 for sure!!! Its like an Oasis of North Indian Food in the desert of Bangalore"
2.0,"600 bucks for a full plate 12 piece Butter Chicken! That's what I was charged when I ordered lunch for home delivery. Their menu tells a different story - 195 for a 4 piece gravy.  I don't know what went wrong, but I was charged Rs. 300 for a half Butter Chicken (6 piece). I was expecting the taste to be out of the world but it was average at the best. The gravy was not thick and they had put roasted chicken pieces in the gravy! Who on earth puts roasted chicken pieces in Butter Chicken!!  Chilli Chicken dry was okay but the butter naans were pretty good.  Overall, I don't think I paid a reasonable price for a strictly average meal. I am never ordering from this place ever."
4.5,"I loved this one.. The best paneer I have had a since a long time. Aam panna was good too. I had Paneer butter masala with butter pulkhas, it was heavenly. Good Job guys. But you could avoid the coconut gratings on the kashmiri kulcha."
4.0,"The place where i will definitely go again and again. benefit for me - 5 mins walking distance from home and the food is yum. reasonably priced. chicken items and dal makhani is yum. :) the chicken is so well cooked. the ambiance is comfortable. the service is quick and cordial. the quantity is generous for all items. The one good thing is unlike other places where you find no variation in the preparation of chicken items, the items are well defined and cooked accordingly here."
3.0,"The first thing i noticed here was nobody is interested in the customers. Unless you ask them, nobody gonna provide you with the menu.Horrible experience in terms of service they provide, basically you will be irritated with the little amount of service they provide. Food wise, not bad but was not too good. Ok- ok kind of place."
3.0,"I am amused to know why this place has such good reviews! My experience was bad.. actually I have never been to this place but had eaten their home delivery food a couple of times. I found d chicken gravy too spicy.. in fact it was so spicy that u could barely taste the chicken! However, the chicken was well cooked. This has happened to me more than once. I believe that they have no knowledge about d proportions of spices required to be added in curries. However, I assume d dry fries would be good. Anyways, the place is decently priced. So it's quite a favourable option for anyone.."
5.0,There is no other place to have an AUTHENTIC food than this place. Chicken Lababadaaaaaaaaaaaar is mouth watering and chiecken Acahari if u like spicy stuff. A superb  crowd on weekends as the place is small compare to the crowd over there. But value of money is toooooooooo much.
3.0,"Decent north indian food but surely not a place you would have on your top priority while planning a dinner. Quality of food definitely has gone down with time.  Gravies are good in taste but high in spices and extremely loaded with oil/ghee Must try are the tandoori starters which are made to perfection Lassi tastes brilliant but make sure to order only one for two  Definitely not worth paying a visit on weekends as the place is over crowded, waiters don't bother attending even with a regular courtesy.  People looking out for rich north indian food: this is a must visit place."
4.0,If all you care is about good food then this is one of the best places.. try chicken chaat ( starter) and keema ( main course) ..
4.0,"Punjab Rasoi is a North Indian restaurant that I would love to go back to. Not only is the food tasty but I found it reasonably priced as well. As a result me and my party of 5 walked away happy and full! We happened to go on a Sunday, so the place was packed. There were 2 families waiting before us and I was very happy with the amount of care they take to make sure you get in according to your turn.  Before we left, we approached the owner to thank him for the food and his response was both, warm and friendly. On a busy Sunday, I call that customer service!  As a side note, I particularly liked the decor. It provided for interesting conversation even as we waited for the food."
4.5,"I cannot rate this place highly enough. The food and service is outstanding. My personal favourite, which I am sure is same for many other people, is Nargisi Chicken (also available as kabab). A must visit restaurant in Bangalore. in fact one of the best places as far as AUTHENTIC punjabi food is concerned."
1.0,"There are no words that can describe the horrible experience that my family had at this place just an hour ago. Horrible staff with no knowledge of food and an equally horrible person at the counter. The staff informed that the one at the counter is the owner.    Apart from other food items, we ordered Dum Aloo. Must say  it is the most horribly made dish that can ever be served. Imagine chopped potatoes and paneer in Dum Aloo. On pointing out, the person who took order said  Humko pata nahin, joh kitchen se ata hai hum serve karte hain.   Any feedback form request is squarely turned down by staff  YAHAN KOI FEEDBACK FORM NAHI HAI.   The owner or the person in the counter was another bad experience  never bothered to look up at you and talk. He argued that dum aloo has chopped potatoes and must have paneer and went on to say - HUM YAHAN BEED SAAL SE JHAK NAHI MAAR RAHE HAI. JUST LEAVE THIS PLACE.  A waste Sunday evening in a restaurant that is not worth mentioning"
1.0,"cannot imagine a worst place to eat in Bangalore than this, more because of the arrogance of the manager who blatantly told us that he is not here to serve but only running the restaurant to make money even if the quality of food is bad and the chef is unaware of how to make a particular dish. If i want to eat paneer i will order paneer and not Aloo but to be told that ""ham to paneer hi dalte hain and ham yaha zhak nahi maar rahe hain"" ( we will serve paneer only and we dont care if you ordered aloo) is something you don't expect to hear if you are paying for what you want to eat."
3.5,"Place to enjoy authentic punjabi food....there is no misery when it comes to ghee and oil. Its a little bit heavy on your stomach but hey whats the point of eating punjabi food if your stomach says ""yaar ab bas"""
4.0,"Just order any item blindly and you will be surprised with its taste. I went with my wife and close friends, the place was bit tight but the food was so good that i ended up licking up my fingers. Do not order too much becoz its quite heavy and spicy, for a group of four a plate of starter four different paratha or nan followed by a curry will suffice."
3.5,"Little difficult to spot this branch of theirs as there are a lot of other boards of shops clustered together. This branch is on 2nd main road adjacent to the LG showroom. Had to wait for about 15 mins for a table and this place is jam packed for lunch(based on what we saw the day we went and also a friend told the same when he had been here for dinner on another day) .  Nothing special about the decor and ambience apart from the whole ceiling that's covered by kites of different sizes and colors. Appreciate their attempt at trying to be different. Felt there were too many tables for the space they have because there was less space for the waiters to move around.   Coming to the food(very popular the food here is) we ordered veg sheek kabab and kandhari murg tikka for starters, both of which were very tasty. The only qualm I had was with the chicken used for the tikka which usually is tender and soft in a tikka but here it was a little tough! Maybe they used a fat chicken which made it that way! The kandhari tikka was spiced with chefs special sauce which had the tandoori flavour ingrained in it.   Main course- kadai chicken(very oily,flavorful, less gravy), sarson da saag( best I have ever had so far), veg biriyani (mildly spiced,tasty), butter roti( LOADS of butter), makki di roti( not at all what we expected.. Yellow in color usually but here we got a dark orange color).   The major disappointment was the lack luster service ( staff need to be trained properly). unfortunately during the meal the power in the restaurant went off and on 4 times because of some problem which the management couldn't seem to rectify. Also, some guy from one of the shops in the complex was arguing with the owner about some water sharing issue which was a minor dampener to our experience!   Total bill came up to 1400 for 5 of us which is quite reasonable in today's age considering the fact that the food is good, which is the only reason one can visit this branch. Have been to their HSR layout branch as well which has a better ambience and am sure I had good food tha time as well( dont remember what I had :( )"
1.0,"Not much healthy food.....poor service, serves kababs cold ...i visited this restaurant multiple times. They should improve food quality and sitting arrangement, sometimes the food is not good for stomach."
5.0,Oye hoye food! The best Punjabi food you will eat in Bangalore. The chicken seekh kabab was phenomenal. Loved mushroom tikka which had smoky flavor to it. Punjabi paneer was also great.. Biryani was good but could have been still better. Will go there again and again.. That is for sure :)
5.0,"Amazing place to visit with friends and family. Very much within budget. Quality of food and service is very excellent! I would love to visit again and again. Both veg and non-veg is good. Chicken achari, chicken lababdaar, gobi tandoori are among the best."
4.0,Often go here for lunch. Really like this place. Taste 9.5/10 Value for money 8/10. Ambiance 6/10 Service 7/10 I'll highly recommend it for legitimate Punjabi cuisine at pocket friendly price.
1.0,"Rude staff. For them, I was just one of their customers, it did not matter to them if they lost me. Did goof-up with home delivery and then refused to re-deliver. Wanted me to travel again for replacement of the meal that they had wrongly packed and delivered. Also refused to adjust the difference in next order. If you are willing to be insulted for the sake of average Punjabi food, this is the right place for you."
4.0,"""North indian food inspired from the Punjab region!"" When these words are put together to form a sentence as a tagline for a restaurant, that definitely calls for a visit. Punjabi Rasoi located close to Kund indian barbeque( which is another amazing place!) does not boast of extraordinary ambience or service. Infact the place is as ordinary as others and the service, as i read from other reviews is infamous(although i was treated very well!).  I have visited this place a few times now and would review a few i tasted:  Nargisi chicken: A wonderful starter. Chicken cooked in tandoor coated with creamy sauce. Since the preparation demands the use of Kasoori Methi in the creamy sauce, it gives a new dimension to the flavor of the dish.   Afghani chicken: I assume this is their signature dish, it was that good! The sheer balance in flavors of the marinate and the perfectly tandoored chicken make this dish outstanding in my standards.  Butter chicken: Punjabi joints are supposed to deliver great butter chicken. And they did. The gravy was creamy, enough butter to make you realise its butter chicken and good balance between sweetness and spiciness.  Chicken Lababdar: Again this chicken gravy was a winner for me. This gravy was special from the rest. The Masala used for this was coarsely ground, giving the gravy a different texture, which in my point was a different experience. A good one, nonetheless.  Amritsari kulcha deserves a special mention here. It had aloo and onions stuffed inside the kulcha, yet somewhat thin. Definitely a must try.  The lassis served here are thick and the masala buttermilk packs a punch. The dishes take their time to appear on the table. Service was good, by my standards. One of the good places to visit for north indian food.  Overall,  Ambience: 3/5 Food: 4.5/5 Service: 3/5 VFM: 4.5/5"
3.5,"Somehow like this crowded place .. The place gets really crowded.. but still its nice...   The food here is great !! Love their Dal makhani..amazing tandoori starters and gravies..   For all the health conscious people, be ready to forget your diet ..for all the ghee .. All the items will be loaded with ghee..  We tried telling the owner once, the food is too oily..and he commented ""Oil nahi hai sir..hum to ghee daalte hain"". :-))))"
3.5,"I had been here three times with my colleagues. Its has never dropped my expectations down. The ambiance too is good, with the kites stuck to the roof, though they make a fluttering noise with the fan on. The service was quite good. They never made us wait for long. I love the food here. Afgani Chicken for starters is my all time favorite from The Panjabi Rasoi. I suppose my veggie friends too were not disappointed here.  Over all it a nice place with good food at affordable price.  Its worth every penny you pay."
4.5,The best pubjabi food I have had in bangalore. We had been searching for a good pubjabi food for a long time and I am sure this is going to be our regular. The paneer that we ordered was so soft. I have never had such a soft and fresh paneer in a restaurant ever. Even the mango pickle that was kept on the table tasted just like a homemade one and not the standard thing that you usually find. I cannot wait to try the chicken here!!!
3.5,"Punjabi Rasoi is one restaurant where we went without a plan. A friend had earlier threw a birthday dinner at this place but I had never been here. We ordered the non veg platter and it was superb. It was so fresh, flavourful and their meats drenched in the cream sauce were a delight. The seekh, the tikkas and tandoori meats were just perfect. The achari paneer was decent and mildly spiced with fresh and soft paneer. For the main course we ordered the chicken curry, kadhai chicken, the quintessential Dal makhni and paneer butter masala. The chicken curry was my favourite and i loved the tang it offered, the kadhai chicken was a bit tough but decently spiced. The paneer butter masala was nice but a tad bit less spicy as compared to what we have had before at other joints. The dal was also pretty good. The breads were also soft and fresh. The service was a bit dry and the server was not very courteous but overall a good experience. Definitely coming back for the chicken curry and the non veg platter.  Taste :7/10 Ambience : 6/10 Service :5/10 Value for money : 6/10"
5.0,"Authentic Punjabi food. Very tasty food. Not so heavy on the pocket.   I went there close to 10.30pm and surprisingly, they were still taking orders and people were still coming in. The place was full. The panneer dishes deserve a special mention as they are out of the world. So soft and so full of flavour. The buttermilk and lassi are good enough to wash down all the Punjabi food.   The naans are really good. Had the chod chod naan (not sure about the name). It was soft and yummy. The service is also really good and the waiters are very friendly.   Awesome Punjabi place."
3.5,"Had been there with the family for the weekend dinner. Good Punjabi food, but overcrowded over the weekends.  for starters we had ordered Paneer tikka, felt that the quantity served is diminishing day by day.  The main course was very good (Kadai Paneer) and the Jeera Rice & Dal were good as well.  Overall, a good Punjabi restaurant in Indiranagar. Just be ready to wait for a while if you are going on a weekend."
3.5,Economical and Authentic Punjabi food...!! I have been to this place 3-4 times. This place is usually crowded because of the fact that it is reasonable and the food is quite yum.  Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani are my favorite here along with Tandoori Roti and a chilled Sweet Lassi.  The service is not so bad and the staff is pretty quick.  Food 3.5/5 Ambiance 2.5/5 Service 3/5
3.0,"Paneer is like eating clouds, soft and melts in your mouth but the dishes are far too oily, literally swamped in it. The little man selling his paan outside is a must! Makes u forget all the oil swishing around in ur gut."
4.5,"This is one of my favourite places for GOOD Indian food.  It is just next to the ING Vysya Bank ATM, and the place itself is not very big.  The place is clean, and houses great food.  I personally recommend the Paneer malamaal, and the paneer tikka masala. The lassi is a must.  The place is really cheap for the good food they serve, and a big meal for two comes up to somewhere around 550 (inclusive of taxes)  I tried the R T nagar outlet, but I strongly recommend the Indiranagar one. It is easily accessible from the metro (some 600 mts)"
3.5,"The food is good. It's as simple as that. Service, ummm, not so much. We had to get into a lot of details to explain the difference between a phulka and a tandoori roti. The ambience, although good, but the AC could have been better. The seats are a little too low compared to the height of the table. But the food is total VFM. Won't mind going back again!"
4.0,"This place deserves a 5/5 for the vfm only. An ordinary looking place, but the fare they serve is mouth watering and fresh, and the non vegetarian dishes are surprising satisfying, esp in  Bangalore where meat is most places is not up to the mark. The service is quick and polite, but if you are having it delivered esp during a weekend, it can take a pretty long time. The best thing about this place is that its unpretentious. They make no bones about ambiance , although it better than passable, but the food is top notch! Service=4/5 Ambiance=2.5/5 Food=5/5 vfm=5/5"
4.0,awesome food...... loved it so much extra khana pada
4.0,"Low visibility because it's on the first floor in one of the lanes in indiranagar. But once you find it, it truly lives upto the name. The starters are all good. In the main course you must try the mutton gravies. A class apart. Well done."
4.0,"Good food. Go there not for the ambience, service or anything else. Just go there for its food.  I ordered their Kalmi kabab for starters. It had 3 pieces of chicken thigh, marianated in a white colored sauce and grilled. It was really yummy although spice levels were low. This is one of the ""Must-try"" starters here. I also ordered tangri kabab, which was chicken legs marinated in the same sauce. I have no clue why the waiter did not care to inform us that both would taste exactly the same. Ordered butter chicken for main course and it was well spiced, and delicious. Their butter rotis are also a must try if you love butter. I guess they make rotis and then dip them in butter, as butter was dripping all over from it.  Prices are decent. You have a fulfilling meal without paying a bomb. Would i go again? Yes, If I am craving for good chicken!"
4.0,awesom food.....liked it... its worth ...
4.0,"By god, this place serves one of the sumptuous butter chicken i have ever had. Punjabi Rasoi is relatively inexpensive, amazing( notice very very amazing) food and easy to locate. Order butter chicken or hyderabadi chicken if you like your food spicy. Get some butter naan and lassi to go with it.. This combination can never go wrong and is a sure cure for homesickness for me Do not forget the 'meetha paan' afterwards.   P.S. - It is difficult to get a table since it is very popular, either book a table, get home delivery or visit during non-peak hours."
4.5,The Best North Indian Restaurant in Bangalore. Delicious Food and Reasonable Prices. Ambience could be worked on.
4.5,Good food.home delivery takes lots of time........................
5.0,"I have been having food here since 8 years they opened at RT Nagar RTO branch during my college days in MSRIT. After college years, I was very happy to continue having their delicious food in Indiranagar outlet near my office. I have tried many other Punjabi restaurants but none of them make such authentic Punjabi curries and Naan.  Must Try -  Tomoto Chicken, Chicken Chat, Chicken Achaari, Paneer Jalfrezi,  Paneer Tikka Masala curry Rasoi Special Paneer curry with butter Naan, Shahi Paneer / Malai Kofta with Kashmiri  Naan"
4.0,The food was tasty and  economical! If you want to enjoy a decent north Indian cuisine with friends without burning a hole in your pocket - then this is a suitable place for you! I have even tried home delivery with them and was quite satisfied with the quick response and preparation.
4.0,"Typical Punjabi style food... I like the Butter chicken and Garlic Naan... The lassi is little overpriced but tastes really good... and all this comes at a very cheap price....  Must Go...  Tip :- For Weekend visit, Better to go early else you might find yourself in the waiting list."
4.5,"Well, probably the best Punjabi food I've had in bangalore so far. Can't speak for its other branches, but indiranagar one is awesome. Ambience wise it's not spacious, nor you feel the grandeur, but you will hardly get time to notice all that whilst having the delicious food here!"
4.0,The food is authentic... Worth the price... The service is good.... Taste is brilliant... Reasonable rates...
4.0,Place is decent..ambience is ok..the paneer dishes are mouth watering and non veg is not that great..mango lassi is an absolute must try..u will visit the the place time and again..guaranteed!!
4.5,My bro recommended this place.. He had been to their brookfield outlet.. We both went to this place for lunch and thought of trying something new.. We ordered the Afgan chicken and the chicken chat.. Both were grilled chicken but with different flavors.. The afgan chicken was less spicy and was marinated in curd where as the chicken chat was spicy and had a red spicy sauce.. The butter naan was real soft but Rs 41 for a naan looked over priced.. We ordered chicken punjabi as the side dish and that spicy too.. The ambiance was nice and they played bollywood numbers giving the place a dhaba kind off feeling.. But a good place to try different varieties of chicken.. We couldnt try more items as we were just two of us and we were overloaded with the 4 items we ordered.
3.5,"I went to this place with my friend on a weekday. The place was not easy to spot (luckily my friend know this place).  The place was not very crowded and the ambience was decent. I liked the way they decorated the ceiling with kites.  Soup  We had clear chicken soup and Mon Chow soup. Both were decent. The Mon Chow was missing the additional chow that chinese restaurants usually provide in plenty. 3.5/5 for this.  Starters  We ordered chicken chaat and Nargisi chicken. Nargisi chicken was saladish in taste- but was good. Chicken chaat was spicy and tasted good. Marination was good for both. 4/5 for this.  Main Course  Chicken Patiala was average for me. I am not sure about the authenticity of this dish, but I did not like the taste much. The butter kulcha was good. 3/5 for this.  Finally, we had lassi to finish off our dinner. It was good, but not the best (Have had better ones from other Punjabi restaurants).  Price for the food is average- neither too pricey nor too low.  Overall- 3.5/5 for this place. Might go here again."
3.0,"Vegetarian's perspective.  Mixed experience. I don't think I'll pay this place another visit.  I ordered a Jaljeera which came at room temperature. I ask for ice and I'm told that they are out of ice and they'll get it in 5 minutes. It never arrived even after repeated requests.  The achari paneer tikka starter was just ok. I didn't really feel that it had been grilled in the tandoor. It was uniformly soft lacking the usual slightly-charred exterior. It tasted fine but definitely didn't have the texture of a well-grilled one.  We ordered kadai paneer and mushroom masala and both were disappointing. The kadai paneer was chunks of paneer which was overflowing with oil and little flavour apart from that of red chilli. Similar was the case for the mushroom. Only in that, it was tough to find mushroom slices in the red oily gravy. The breads were fine.  The service had both extremes. The guy who took our order was quite good and we were quite impressed at his skills. The guys who were later serving us were quite pathetic. From the expression on their faces, it felt as if they think are doing us a favour. And when we ordering main course, one guy starts taking the order and in the middle, another guy joins him. So, both were writing the same thing on their pads. This kind of confusion is quite telling of the service standards at this place.  My non-vegetarians seemed to appreciate their starters. As for the vegetarians, I think this place can be missed."
4.5,Dont forget to have Amritsari Chicken here its one of the best dish i have ever had in my life.  it's the special dish here and not found on menu
4.0,"Oh God gave a great memorial wid dis place. The starters out here is just yummmmm mouth watering. Chicken Achaari is the best. Gives you the real feel when you order Punjabi Lassi that's it done. Place is always packed, coming on weekends be prepared to wait."
3.5,Well the ambience was unimpressive.  The food was above average. I had vegetarian consisting of Paneer curry and Roti. The Paneer was good but the tandoori Roti was okay. The taste was authentic north Indian but not authentic splendid. It's a place where I would go only if other moderately priced north Indian options were exhausted.
4.0,"On the lazy day at office, we team mates suddeny decided to go out for lunch and while going through list of Indira Nagar hotels, we got confused. With many amongst us not willing to take chance of exploring new places, we ended up finalizing The Punjab Rasoi. We reached the place at around 2 o'clock. It was the day of Baisakh. So the restaurant was decorated with all colors of kites on the roof. The environment was somewhat conjusted but yet comfortable. As we were quite late for lucnh, we ordered in haste. The Paneer Tikkas were fresh and tasty. There were lot of food enthusiast among us, so almost all kinds of Bread, from Stuffed Kulchas to Garlic Naan was ordered. The Bread qualify was very good. The service was quite lethargic though as our starter and main course came almost together. Waiter also took long time to get the onions. The Punjabi Paneer was spicy and awesome. The sweet curry was Methi Mutter Malai and then there was typical signatory Dal Tadka. It was really good. The chicken gravy which I tasted was also very spicy and mouth watering. We ended up eating all that in less than 45 minutes. It was a nice experience."
4.0,"IF you're a north Indian and craving for some Delhi style butter chicken  and malai tikka. THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU . Don't mind the grumpy looking waiters ad concentrate on your food , that's  the key here . AFGHANI CHICKEN, METHI MALAI PANEER, GARLIC NAAN , BUTTER CHICKEN AND STRAWBERRY LASSI , are must try . The chicken tikkas are good and yes the place is VALUE FOR MONEY .  The outside seating is available rarely , the place is crowded on the weekends .  Therefore prebook your table ."
1.5,"To be very honest I didn't like the food at all , I am from north so when it comes to north indian food I do understand the authenticity, quality & taste part .. we have ordered Chicken Malai Tikka as a starter - Disaster .. first time in my life I've seen that in Punjabi restaurant Chickem Malai Tikka served carrot & cabbage ... its ...... toooo sweet for the main course we ordered Chicken Kadai & Paneer  Pasanda .. guess what .. both the gravy exactly the same .. taste exactly the same + its tooooo oily & rich with masala it was so bad that immediately we have ordered plain curd to overcome the uneasiness ."
1.0,"Very loud and noisy,  ambience was very mediocre and the food was floating in oil. I am a Punjabi. The food they serve here doesn't taste a bit like punjabi food,  there are better north Indian restaurants. The service is pretty slow and not very friendly. I am surprised this has received so many good votes."
4.5,"After seeing mixed reviews on Zomato, I decided to take a risk and went there with my colleague. For all the people craving for some good punjabi food in bangalore, this is the place to be. We ordered Afghani chicken, Mutton rogan josh alongwith pudina paratha and amritsari kulcha. We had lassi and now on the weekend we are feeling sleepy in office hours. Ambiance is not too shabby. This is my first review on zomato and I am doing this just because the afghani chicken in the restaurant requested me to do so. It is very difficult to find such good food in this price range in bangalore."
4.0,One of our favourite restaurant in banglore.  From chicken nargisi to chicken musallam we had it all. Must go if around this area                                                                 doctorfoodiereviews.blogspot.com

4.0,for a heavy north indian dining experience.. Punjabi Rasoi is the place to be.. Simply amazing veggie options.. i am surprised everytime i have been there.. They have a new paneer gravy option available.. Kudos...
1.0,I ordered food to be delivered at home. They took almost 2 hours. Will never order food from Punjabi Rasoi for home delivery.
4.5,"Went there couple of times.. Didn't disappoint any time..  Food is very tasty , quantity makes us happy..   The Veg and Non Veg starters are a must try of this place.."
4.5,"Best Dal Makhani in town, decent starters, dessert sucks especially kheer."
3.0,"-) A fine moderate priced restaurant. I loved the punjabi dishes here. These people keeps on changing the special for the day, and they tastes good as well. I ordered roti, naan, and chicken punjabi, the roti was very soft and nice. The ambiance of the hotel is little poor. they even have open air sitting. I loved lassi here. Will surely visit again. + food tastes good & fresh, moderate prices, fast in serving items, lassi. - wait for getting a table, some curries are tasting same."
4.0,Great to see Punjabi Rasoi open a branch at Brookfield.  We used to travel all the way to Indiranagar to get the signature taste. Hopefully Brookfield branch will be equally good
3.5,Nice Place! Good Punjabi Food. The starters and soup were appetizing :) Afghani chicken starter is yummylicious! :) Main course seemed a bit oily...taste wasn't up to the expectations. Punjabi chicken ought to be yummy in punjabi rasoi...but was disappointing. Cordial Staff :)
1.0,Very bad service. Don't opt for home delivery. First they will tell you that they need big order to deliver and delivery time is always more than 2 hours. I am not happy
1.0,"They take hours to deliver When you call them, they are completely unapologetic about the delay. Very rude staff.  Getting to the food. Extremely inconsistent and laden with oil. There are definitely better Punjabi food joints in the area."
1.5,"If you are ordering over the phone or online, you have to wait for 2 hours. The operator will say that the order will be delivered within 45 mins and it will not arrive before 2 hours. After a couple of inquiry calls your call will no longer be responded by them.  Punjabi Rasoi sucks!!!"
1.0,"Extremely frustrating experience. I placed on order for home delivery, and that guy told me that they will deliver it in 45 mins and its been 1 and half hours but the order hasn't yet arrived. When i called again he was talking to me as if i was asking for free food. No manners at all. My suggestion to all of u, never even think about punjabi rasoi. Extremely hungry and frustrated.I don't even want to give one rating as i hvent evn seen the food."
3.5,Good value for money. Good food at reasonable price. Good service
4.5,"Do you like Chicken Starters? So, there are quite a few good restos in Indiranagar for North-Indian food but when you want the cent per cent bang for your buck or impress someone with your resto hunting skills (economical+finger licking good) .. Yeah, you should try this.   Continue here : http://zomato.arpanramtek.com/blog/2014/02/22/punjabi-rasoi-indiranagar-bangalore/  So Punjabi Rasoi is mentioned by almost all (sane people) as one of the best, to eat good North Indian food. From the outside, you'll never even know what's cookin and what you're missing; from the inside it's pure joy, dhaba clubbed with fine dining and taste complementing the stars.   Chicken Achaari, Haryaali, Nargisi, Chicken tikkas; well the list never ends and they never ever disappoint, and these are just the starters. On the main-course, Chicken Kadhai, Butter Chicken and Mutton Punjabi are something that have sticked to my palate. Anyways, the best is still yet to come; you must not miss eating the Rice and Dal Tadka combo, heavenly it is.   The eruption of saliva volcanoes is the best i can describe in the periphery of words.   If you've read till here then don't forget to have the lassi!  :D Enjoy oye!  p.s. Found the panwalla's snap ! He's quite good they say and sits just beside the door :)                                             eatoutdevout.com"
5.0,"The best place in Bangalore for Punjabi food!! It's cheap, basic ambience, but very very outstanding food.  Even the service is quick and the waiters are friendly, ready with great suggestions.  It's a great place for a quick meal.. Absolutely my favorite!"
3.5,"Visited for lunch today with my colleagues. My last visit to this hotel was 5-6 years back ! Quite a lot ( in terms of ambience & seating ) has changed.   Even though the scene from outside & the entrance is not charming , once you reach in it is not less than a fine dine restaurant.   Have a good seating capacity & decently decorated to give a punjabi touch !   Service was quick as the crowd was just catching up by 1:00 PM.   We ordered ,   Chicken hot & sour - Not very outstanding when compared to the similar restaurants & no where near to to the Chinese restaurants flavour.   Roti - is just the normal roti , what else it can be ! !   Chicken Punjabi - Gravy , was exceptional. Right to the std of Punjabi food & the pieces were large in portion.   As I could n't find much choices in the rice session ( was looking for something traditional ) went for chicken fried rice ( in Punjabi Style ! ) - Was my choice so no complaints. It was just the plain one. Qty , not large. May be just sufficient for 2 people.   The bill came for 635 Rs all inclusive. Bit expensive is it.   To conclude , yes you can try this when in & around indira nagar for a quick working lunch. Of course it gives you the punjabi flavour if you choose the right desi items.  PS : Surprised to see a new line item in the bill . Rs 10 charged for the half serving ( for the 2/3 soup I ordered ) A latest innovative idea it seems !"
1.0,"Me and my friend planned to go out for dinner on 10 February 2014 at 9:45 pm,   where we get good food... Yes. Next minute both of us said lets go to ...The Punjabi Rasoi , and trust me , we were in mood to hog... but they served chicken curry which was smelling so good but  uncooked chicken... felt like throwing out and Roti s were so hard... but when we complained the same to Chef... stating chicken was uncooked!!! He was shocked!!! but still he took back with smile ....but story repeats, they served raw uncooked chicken!!!  Again i complained to chef,  and he complained the same to owner !!! Big man came with fake smile !!! Oh chicken is un cooked ? how can i help you? When we said, sir your people have served chicken which is uncooked , we dont need the curry  or any other items as well... please send the bill!!! with out shame he said , sir shall i pack the same curry ? Please we are paying to  have good food not uncooked food.... server something which has value , be polite with your customer !!! Have some shame , when your staff commit mistakes...you cant repeat the same again and again....  I would suggest everyone ,if you feel like to going to place, which is pathetic and serve uncooked food  ...  right here, place call  The Punjabi Rasoi- Indiranagar , Bangalore."
1.0,"Weve had very bad experience at Punjabi Rasoi Indiranagar not once but three times in a row!  Service is pathetic,  waiters and captions are not trained are very rude.  We had to wait for getting second set of roties for half an hour.  No one bothered till we asked for the bill and complained to the owner.   Ironically owner also was very rude and told us it wont matter even if you wont come next time. Finally He gave us a gift.Bill of Rs 10,000 for dinner for 3.  See the picture below.  Stay away from this place, never never I would recommend this to anyone"
4.5,Easily one of the best places for great north-indian food in Bangalore. Have been there multiple times and they never disappointed. Make sure you don't go without booking a table as the place is always full.
4.0,"Punjabi Rasoi, the name itself suggests the platter. This place offers food , one would like to die food. Cheap as per the quality and quantity of food. Decent ambience.  Always heavy rush. You need to have patience. (Panner stuff well prepared)  Heaven for non-veg lovers( Afghani Chicken, Chicken Punjabi etc...)  Visit this place if one gets a chance. Try it in a group."
4.0,"Food is spicy and those who like to eat spicy punjabi food should try this place. Lassi is good drink to digest the food. there are good variety of veg starters, especially paneer varieties. Wheat parota and mutton gravy is a perfect combination for non-veg lovers.  Ambiance is ok, parking is bit difficult"
3.0,Very oily  !! Used tissues to remove oil from kulchas. Veg kofta was tasty:)
3.5,"Visited this place with group of friends. We ordered many items - soup, different starters, various Gravy's and breads and lassi - all Veg.  The soup was okish. The starters were good, especially the paneer items. I think they specialize in paneer items.  In Gravy too the channa masala and paneer were good, I would say that they are the safe items, dal was decent too. The breads were normal and not soaked in oil as some of the reviews suggest. The lassi was bad. The curd muvst have gone sour and it ruined it. Don't go for flavored lassi here, if you want lassi then go for the normal one. The food is actually quite cheap and tastes nice. Rating for food- 4/5  Ambience wise there is nothing outstanding, the place looks clean has decent lights etc, but at such price you can't really expect too much ambience any ways.  Service was decent but they can improve in it, couple of starters were still pending when the main course arrived.  Over all a decent place to visit if you want to eat Punjabi food and don't want to spend a bomb."
1.0,It is the worst restaurant i have seen.  the veg food is full of butter. parathas are half baked poured in butter. gravy is as if made out of butter and recooked some 10 times before serving.  they are fraud on the name of lassi. lassi was like kept in fridge since months and just poured and served to you.  A restaurant worth Re 1 the tip. even that is waste.
3.0,Just one comment - oily!!  The rotis were literally soaked in oil. We had  to use 3-4 tissues to wipe the oil off the surface...  The best part is the taste of gravies... ( we had to drain the top oily layer in a vessel )... Yummy !! That's the only reason I am giving 3 stars..  Mango lassi tasted terrible !
5.0,"And we went there again!   Five of us could think of no other place for a family dinner to celebrate the MIL's birthday. We've been here multiple times before and can safely rely on it to get our tummies packed with good veg and non-veg food on any given day!  We ordered paneer achaari, chicken chaat and tomato chicken for starters. Their paneer is a star! It is soft and fresh and easily matches up to the best paneer I've had (@ Punjab Grill). The chicken chaat is a regular and never fails to impress the meat lovers. The tomato chicken was our first and the family thoroughly enjoyed it. The thick coating/gravy was cooked to perfection and every last bit of it was wiped clean off the plate.   I ordered a mango lassi to drink. At 80, I found it to be overpriced even though the quantity and the taste were great. The lassi was thick and sweetened just right! Had it been a little moderate in the price tag, I'd have ordered a second.  For the mains, we ordered kulchas and rotis with veg kofta, chicken lababdar and chicken patiala. The veg koftas are my absolute favorite and if there I was one veg dish I had to name in the indian cuisine for my final meal, this would be it! The koftas are plump, soft and delicious. The gravy, according to me, beats the chicken curries hands down! The chicken lababdar was cooked in onion and capsicum gravy and was pretty decent. The patiala curry was way better- red, rich and spicy!   We had no place left for rice or dessert. We ended up packing leftovers of all three curries to be happily had for lunch today.   For all that happineess, we paid 1400 and thought it was worth every rupee!   ----- 16 Aug, 2013 -----  have eaten here about 10-12 times and it our place for all any friends/guests/relatives visiting the city! Love the quality of food and its authentic taste. Prices are fairly moderate as compared to other restaurants around.  Could do better w.r.t the following 1. Service. A little courtesy wouldn't harm any one. 2. Drinks prices are crazy!!  A jaljeera costs some 60-70 bucks which is ridiculous!!  We keep going to this place and eat to our heart's content. We just never order any drinks!"
1.5,"Don't go for Home Delivery option...  1. It takes one hour.  2. Sometimes, the packaging is so great that the food gets mixed up. 3. You may not get what you ordered for.  4. Don't order on festivals."
1.5,"On 31st afternoon me and my teammates decided to order lunch and we zeroed in on Punjabi Rasoi, but were deeply disappointed with the mess they made with our order and the lack of concern for the same. Firstly we were promised our delivery in 45 mins but received the order only after 1 hour 15 mins and we had to call the guys to check on the order.  We ordered half Afghani Chicken and two chicken biryani's in non-veg and veg seekh kabab, babycorn tandoori, dal makhani, panner tikka masala, phulkas and veg biryani in veg.  When the order was delivered they had given us a full afghani chicken instead of half leading to a lot of wastage as we had only 2 people eating non-veg and they had forgotten to send us the phulkas. When we called the guy and informed him that he had missed on phulkas he replied that he had the audacity could not send out anyone to deliver only phulkas and if we ordered another curry or starter he would send out a person for the delivery in another half an hour.   If there is a mistake made by the restaurant it is minimum decency that they atleast see to it to rectify the mistake when brought to notice. Customer service plays an equal role along with the food's taste in pleasing customers.  Coming to the food the veg seekh kababa lacked any taste. The babycorn tantoori was spicy and tangy and had a nice taste. Panner tikka masala was quite tasty and the dal makhani wasnt bad either. The Veg Biryani was way too oily. The quantity for the full afghani chicken was way to less for the price which was charged for it.  All in all go there or order from there if you have no other options but do not expect any kind of customer service."
4.5,Good food good ambiance good test...always are good....
1.0,Their order taking process is not nice for the indiranagar branch ... The guy taking the order is so mean and doesn't talk properly ... They should remove the option of home delivery ...
4.5,"Ask the owners of this restaurant about the best tasty dish in their place and they confidently say all are best. And they are not exaggerating for sure, the proud Punjabi couple who have the good taste of food are.running this restaurant in R T Nagar also. The chicken kalmi kabab is legendary and down right delicious, I have been fan of it from past 15 years and it has never gone wrong. The tandoori options are really good, quality, quantity wise. From a small outlet in CBI road to a kind of chain of restaurants is inspiring, their food shows it. Biryani is a bit downside and not the best bet. Authentic and tasty punjabi cuisine, tasty feast indeed. Price is also reasonable for the quality, taste and quantity."
3.5,Good food....... Hsr branch service wise is better..... Indiranagar branch is lil small I guess..... Food was very tasty..... Can go for a usual dinner.... No comments on ambience as its not a ambience pro place....the good factor is the food taste....
2.5,Excellent food; But Slow home delivery (took 1 hour 40 mins after I placed the order).  The excuse I was given was 'Its a weekend'!
4.5,"Many of my friends who went to Punjabi Rasoi have been recommending it to me since a long time but I couldn't get to visit it. But, I visited it finally with two of my friends as we ended up at Indiranagar and were out of options. As soon as I reached, I found a place on the first floor of a building and did not look so appealing from the street and I was just thinking - This better be good. I should say, I was not disappointed with my decision. It is a tidy place with enough place to accommodate more than a 50 people I guess. The ceiling was covered with bright kites which actually was what made me think twice when I was on the street but after I was seated, I got used to it. It even had a spiderman on a corner of the ceiling! I don't think Spiderman is of some regional importance there. :P Well, jokes apart, the ambiance was decent and cozy.  We wanted to eat vegetarian that day since two of the three (obviously not me) preferred vegetarian and thus we ordered - Babycorn Tandoori for the starter, Bainghan Bartha and Kadai Paneer for the main course along with a Roti Platter which had 6 different types of breads. We also order 2 Sweet Punjabi Lassis and 1 Chocolate Punjabi Lassi. The Babycorn Tandoori was crispy and tasty but it was s bit hard maybe because of the grilling and could have been marinated for a longer time I guess. The Bainghan Bartha had a lot of vegetables and it tasted really good with moderate spiciness. The Kadai paneer also had good amount vegetables and the paneer was home cooked rather than the packaged one and I really loved it. It reminded me of home. :) I loved both the curries actually and they had more quantity than we thought. I guess one curry would have been sufficient instead of two. The rotis were soft and each had different breads but everyone liked them. My sweet Lassi was was thick and tasted really good. Thank God I was not the one who ordered the Chocolate Lassi, my friend finished it but he has a weird taste, so I can't talk about that one.  The bill came out to be around Rs 900 for all of this and it was good for 3 people. If we would have been careful about the curries, it would have been lesser. It was worth the price and I loved the food. Do check this place out when you have the craving for Punjabi food, you won't be disappointed. :)"
4.0,The food wat all i tasted in dis hotel was tasty.. For all nonvel lovers its nice place 2 hangout only thing is u have 2 wait for a long quite long 2 get ur food servered..
4.5,"All time Favorite, Good service and taste, packed on weekend's"
4.0,"This is our go to restaurant when ever we dont know where to go. Amaizing tomato chicken, it is basically a tandoori chicken whith masala. The punjabi chcken gravy is againg delish the kulcha and the rotis are really flaky and nice. I would let go of the biryna as you can find better but gravys and roti are must try and the panner are really soft and nice ....so vegetarians also may not complain."
4.0,"Had here so many times that I myself cant remenber. Taste is really authentic,portions are very good and the prices are also reasonable. Amongst my favourites are the Malai tikka & Chicken Bharta. Try avoiding the sweet dish as it is noot good. The nan,Kulcha,laccha paratha are all the same. I think the best thing there is the jaggey mouth freshner they give you at the end of the meal."
4.5,Great authentic Punjabi food .Excellent  flavours and authentic taste. Not many places in Bangalore where you would find great food like this . Good part is that they are delivery friendly.Highly recommended !
3.0,"I got the food home delivered. My guests were vegetarian so we ordered a couple of breads, Dal Makhani and Paneer Kadhai. The Paneer was soft, as the restaurant boasts. Food was definitely above average and not heavy on the pocket. I just wish it wasn't AS oily. I actually removed a couple of spoons of the oil that was floating on top before I served the food. I guess I'd definitely order again if I could be sure the oil was just a one time glitch."
3.0,"Located in the first floor of shopping complex few meters away from the Indira Nagar RTO , this restaurant has good amoutn of punjabi dishes. But the taste differs based on the days and the crowd. I have visited a couple of times, the first time though it was a sunday night, the preparations were satisfactory, the second time we visited during a week day and then they were not up to the mark.   Worth visiting once in a while."
4.0,Great punjabi food in this part of Bangalore. Always full any day anytime.  But if you are ready for some dhaba tasting delicious food veg or non veg go here..  Try their sheekh masala .Tandoori chicken. Mutton sagwala . Bhaingan bharta is nice. Bhindi masala is good. Stuffed kulcha .  And of course masala cola .. The kheer is good and so are the gulag jamuns. Though hygiene needs to be looked at by the owners. The service is very good  I find the place very dark due to the kites above .. Maybe they need to relook at thewall colors or increase the lighting but overall it's great food.. Pickle sometimes is spoilt there so be carfeul..
4.0,"Much has been said about how this restaurant serves the best Punjabi food in town, I agree hands down. It's a small, crowded restaurant in one of the many lanes near Toit. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Sunday night. I'm not sure if they take reservations.  Must try - Dal Makhani, Paneer achari (starters), butter phulka.  Don't try the Lassi or the buttermilk, though.They're utterly disappointing, for the lassi you'd expect from a Punjabi restaurant.  Cost (Meal for two) -  600  Value for Money - 4.5/5 Will I go here again? Yes!"
4.0,"Awesome food and not very expensive. For north Indian food touch, this is the best place to go in India Nagar. Ambiance was fine, service was also good."
4.0,"Tasty, Rich food.  Good service and at a great price. Need I say more?"
4.0,"Pretty good food, good service, really good & authentic taste Taste: 4/5 Ambiance: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Value for Money: 4/5"
4.5,One of the best punjabi food i had in Bangalore..  Try punjabi paneer.  I didn't have non veg.  But as the veg dishes were too good.  So i can presume.. Non veg will also be as good.. Even better ;)  Must try
4.0,Among the best authentic punjabi food in the city. Very affordable prices.   Achaari paneer and amritsari kulcha are their specialities
4.0,"This restaurant, without any doubt, serves the best punjabi food in the city.. The restaurant's claim of serving the softest panner  is not an overstatement.. The look of the restaurant is also nice with kites stuck on the ceiling and pan wala standing outside the main door.. Service is prompt and food is hot and tasty all the times.. To summarize, one of the best and economical place to visit for food (veg and non veg) lovers..   Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 (because of too much rush all the times waiters can be little unattentive) Ambience: 3/5 Price: 4.5/5"
3.5,"must visit for satisfying ur Punjabi taste buds. If you are a non-vegetarian, do try Kali mirch chicken. If in case you are Chawla's cream chicken fan...you will surely love it..."
4.0,"If you want to taste good Punjabi food and do not wish to drill holes in your pocket, this place is a must visit. Food is really tasty and the quantity served will not make you feel like ants.  Good place to go in a big group and enjoy some mouth watering dishes, special recommendation is Chicken Achaari."
4.0,Anchaari chicken is worth enough to make the chicken martyr :) ambience is little bit crowded naan really taste good and beware when you ask for spicy it would be far then normal
1.0,I woudnt have rated it 1 if I would had an option. Asked for home delivery 2 times and it takes more than 1 hr30 min even for a distance of 2 km. if we leave that aside also the staff is so offensive and doesnt even know how to talk normally. Strong No to..... Never will order from this place
4.5,If you are craving for some AUTHENTIC Punjabi cuisine- 'Punjabi Rasoi' is the place!  The place is pretty decent with Punjabi music being the highlight. The achari chicken is to die for. The oil and greasy food doesn't stop you from all the gorging.   I've been to this place umpteen number of times but continue to love the food. The service is good i.e. when the restaurant is not packed. The prices of the dishes aren't on the higher side.  A must visit place if you are a authentic 'Punjabi cuisine lover' and don't mind indulging in some heavy greasy sumptuous food :D
4.0,"I was looking to try something spicy and Punjabi Rasoi was the place where I landed. I want to mention that with every step you take for this restaurant you are convinced that you are at a good place. Yes you are!!   From very first moment you start feeling it. Staff is very friendly and Punjabi music turns your mood on. You feel good inside and I liked that they even wanted to keep thier water special and you will find a lamon and mint in water JUG. Coming to the food , You will find spicy enough.   I dint find good breads as they dont have RUMALI and I ordered KULCHA which was hardly looked like it. You cant find difference in KULCHA and TANDOORI ROTI. Dishes were fine and my overall experience was good. 4 out of 5 this restaurant deserve :)"
4.5,"If you are craving for some real-good-authentic Punjabi food,your search ends here,BINGO !!  Last Sunday,visited this place for a dinner.Didn't expect much, as many restaurants nearby even though serve satisfactory North Indian food but surely not something authentic as this .Located near the Indiranagar BDA complex,in between many other restaurants but definitely best among them. As you move up  to the first floor and enter the restaurant you may cringe to find this place a bit cramped and crowded but trust me,the food would makes you ignore everything around.  About the food ,the menu is quite extensive, many varieties of starters,main course and even breads I should say.With many options to choose from,decided to go with something that we order regularly.Skipped the starters and directly to the main course.The Non-veggie friend ordered a malamaal chicken. I in the other had from many days was searching for the perfect KOFTA curry ,had tried in many restaurants but couldn't get what I was looking for.So thought of trying Kofta again.Along with the gravies had ordered the usual nans and Biryani and yes a Dal Makhani too. A special mention to the server here,for his frankness as he was audacious enough to tell us that the Vegetable Dum Biryani that we were about to order may contain chicken pieces too.Was a bit miffed for a moment,but then should appreciate his frankness  The food came soon enough,The chicken was perfectly cooked,bursting with flavors and spices.The Kofta on the other hand  was definitely  what I was searching for ,rich,creamy and spicy.Cant use enough adjectives for it !!The Dal Makhani was definitely  not the best that I had eaten.The nans were butterry ,and the biryani is quite quite hot and delicious. Perfect Biryani with some real smokey flavors.Slurp!Will definitely go back to try other dishes from the menu.  I should add ,the food reminded me of the rich food served in the various restaurants that covers the whole stretch of highways from Delhi and Beyond .  The service here is slow,and sometime you have to constantly nudge the waiters.But then obviously the food makes up for it.Only because of the poor service I have cut the 0.5 thingy. The prices are perfect for the quantity and quality of food served.We even took a doggie bad ,as the quantity  served is good enough for 2 people  Will definitely recommend this place.Saw in zomato that it has many other branches in Bangalore. And if you are put up in or around Indiranagar this is a place that you should definitely  visit."
4.5,Great rich indian food one can find in Indiranagar .  Have been there many times and each time the quality and the service has been good .  The crowd there all the time speaks more to it.  Chicken chat is a must try.
4.0,realy tasty north indian food.  i have been regular there for last 3-4 years but this place rarely disaapointed me.
4.0,"Walk into this place to get your Punjabi batteries charged up! If you are in the mood to binge on some shuddh desi khana without worrying about those calories too much, come dig into the mouthwatering fare at Punjabi Rasoi. You could pass by this restaurant and not even notice it, if you weren't specifically looking for it. A flight of stairs up (which is highly cramped and might make you think twice about entering the place), you walk into the restaurant which opens up into a eating space in front, and a deck toward the left which offers a view of the street below.   The interiors are surprisingly average ( looks like not much attention has been given to this!). The ceiling is plastered with kites of different colors, shapes and sizes all over. I even saw Spiderman towards a corner, plastered on a wall flying a kite! We walked in for lunch around 12.30, and by 1pm the place was packed to the brim with people waiting outside. Service is quick and efficient, as long as you are served by the right guy. Our waiter for the day was Ram, who has served at the other Punjabi rasoi outlet in HSR before moving to this location. Special mention of praise for the guy, soft-spoken, well mannered and always at hand even though he was handling 3-4 tables. In comparison, the other waiters looked like they were just going through the motions.  Coming to food, we ordered Tamatar dhania shorba, Nargisi chicken, Rajma, Choor Choor Naan and Veg Pulao with roasted papad and sweet/salt lime soda to go with. As I'd walked in with a veggie friend, it was going to be a veggie day with less meat options! Tamatar Dhania Shorba : The dhania in the soup was so fresh that it added a whole new zing to the flavor of the soup. Though the oil content was slightly higher than what i'd expected in this, the soup was an absolute treat! As pointed out by Ram, the soup was slightly watery which is just the way I wanted it. Nargisi Chicken : Fantabulous! The highlight of the meal. Very few restaurants in Bangalore serve this dish, and I was glad to come across it at Punjabi Rasoi! Served on the bone and in a creamy sauce dominated by Kasoori Methi, it was a treat for the tastebuds! Rajma - A letdown, way too excess oil in this one implied that the gravy lost its sheen. While the rajma itself was cooked to perfection, the gravy disappointed. Choor Choor Naan - Stuffed with paneer, aloo and gobi and drenched in butter, this was tastyyy! Though it wasnt crushed, It went down well with the rajma.  Veg Pulao - Didnt manage to have a bite of it, as I was already full with the chicken, rajma and naan. The friend liked it though, and we got it packed for her as she couldnt finish it all.  Sweet/Salt lime - Was more of a salt lime than a sweet/salt, but tbh i didnt expect much from it and wasnt disappointed.  All the above worked up to around 700 bucks, VFM I'd say! Considering the amount of people thronging the place, I'd imagine that no one minds the oil as it adds to their asli desi experience! Will definitely go back specially to check their chicken and paneer ( as i read that their 1kg paneer is made from 10ltrs of milk!). Defo Recommend!"
4.0,"One of the best restaurants around Indiranagar if you love Punjabi food, they server authentic punjabi dishes - this is one of the restaurants we frequently visit. This is one of the restaurants where both Veg and Non-veg can enjoy. Try out their Aloo haryali starters. The service is also good. They had a recent increase in price. It is a little higher for this type of restaurant.  But you will never regret for the food - go for it!  Overall - 4/5 Ambiance - 3/5 Taste - 4/5 Service - 3.5/5 VFM - 3.5/5"
1.0,"The food of the place is good... but if you are ordering home delivery for dinner, better order from some other place... my experience with them is, you order food at 9.30 PM and you get food at 12.03 AM (no exaggerations). I feel sorry for the 3 folks whose order the delivery boy was still carrying. When I asked the person on Phone that its taking more the 1 hour time promised, the response was ""Yours is not the only order and its taking 2 hours. Main kuch nahin kar sakta (I cannot do anything.)"". BAD ATTITUDE.  Also this review is not on one time occurrence but 3 times I have got delivery beyond 11.30 PM. Treat,  is any day a better option for home delivery. I will never order home delivery from them ."
3.0,"Good food with not so good service, decent place to chill out if you have all the time in the world. Better would be to order food from here, since the food is good this will eliminate the bad service part making sure you don't waste your time to get good food. Food - 4/5 Service - 2/5"
5.0,"Disclaimer :- I am a punjabi from Delhi and this review might seem a bit biased. But when a guy who has grown up eating butter chicken and paneer butter masala since the age I couldn't even spell delicious, and suddenly after a year in bangalore finds a restaurant that makes him relive all those memories, it's bound to happen. No one who goes there or wants to go there should worry about the ambiance, staff or anything else for that matter. Like Arjun in Mahabharata, your focus should be at only your main target. Food. And is the food good here!! I have had butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, kadai chicken, shahi paneer, paneer butter masala, makhani dal. My every subsequent visit involves ordering something from these dishes only. I just can't have enough of it.  All these dishes have the softest paneer or the most tender chicken that I have had in bangalore. Makhani dal here, though not the authentic one you might have in amritsar or dhabas at delhi highways ( best places for makhani dal by the way), but still has a distinct taste that I love.  Whenever I leave this place, I am so full that just a speed breaker at ring road makes me uncomfortable in stomach( I hope you get it  :-)  ).   This place is very budget friendly but the food is so good that you won't care for it anyhow. I definitely recommend every person who reads this review to definitely try this place. I am yet to find a place that serves better mughlai food, especially paneer, though punjab grill comes a close second."
4.5,"The best Punjabi food in Indiranagar. Given their price and taste, nothing can beat it. I just love the way they prepare the rich and thick gravy. I wish could learn from their chefs. My favourite are Butter Chicken, Chicken Lababdar, Chicken Kalimirch. The Haryali chicken is however a let down, it doesnt taste anything close to what it should. Also I should mention, the masala egg curry is awesome."
5.0,"Awesome Spicy Food, ungliyan chat-te,ansu pochhte maza aa gaya. After long time got the real Tasty Food."
4.0,"This is a place I regularly visit...If you want to have some great Punjabi food in budget, blindly go for it. Ambience is not that great but taste is what its all about.  Almost all of the chicken starters and gravies are amazing but my personal favourite  are  Starters:- Nargisi Chicken Afghani Chicken  Main Course:- Rasoi special chicken Chicken lababdar Chicken hyderabadi   Vegetable tikka,Aloo Bharwan,Malai kofta.. are some of vegetarians delight.  Thumbs up from my side to punjabi rasoi for the kickass food :)"
4.5,"Good taste, but little expensive."
2.0,"Heard so much about this place in office so wanted to try it. The place of difficult to locate but you can't miss it completely. My friend asked me to try Tomato chicken , given the name I would have never ordered but took my friends advice. It's really really good. Ordered salt lassi which was excellent too. Overall the first experience was good.  Next time I took my wife there , though she loved the food as well, we had a unpleasant experience with the guy who runs the place. We went on weekend which is really crowded here, since I went with my son I requested for a long seat and got a rude reply saying I can't waste a seat since it's meant for 4 people. I told that I am regular customer and having recommending the place to my friends and for that I got even ruder reply that "" it's upto you to come or not come"" and the tone suggested that he doesn't care.  The food is good but the service sucks big time If the boss is this rude you can understand the waiters. I don't think I will go there again and it's a shame because the food is good. But I am fed up with attitude in most restaurants in Bangalore, we have customers in truck load and really don't care for any customer service, however we behave people will come. I hate this attitude and in a small way I have stopped going to this place and discouraging my friends and family to go this place.   The rating I have haven given is for food, rest all sucks..."
3.5,"Had read rave reviews about this place by many foodies on Zomato. Last time i wanted to go here, i could not locate it easily and finally ended up going to Chettiars which was also nearby. While sitting in Chettiars and looking out the window, i finally spotted Punjab Rasoi. We decided to head out to this place last night for dinner...  It is located on the same road with Chettiars, Bow Barracks etc. This place is located on the first floor of a row of shops and the entrance is basically a set of stairs leading upto to the restaurant. Parking is a little difficult and you may need to venture into one of the cross roads if you don't find a spot on the main road. There are 2 bars/liquor shops nearby and a karthik's mithai shop also...  We reached there at around 8:30 yesterday and the first thing that caught our attention was the crowd waiting near the entrance. My wife asked for a table and was told politely that it will take around 25 mins. We decided to wait it out. There were a lot of people waiting for dining in or takeaway and as we stood there people were pouring in. We thought ""The food MUST be good here"" for it to attract so much crowd.  Anyway we got our table in exactly 20 mins and settled down to order. Ambiance was a a bit weird. They have two levels..and the whole roof is covered with bright colored kites...kinda gaudy...but then it was a different touch. Forgot to ask why they have all those kites up there...maybe next time.  Lots of dishes in all sections starters, main dishes, breads and rice. We ordered my daughters all time fav panner  tikka, my wife's all time fav tandoori mushrooms and i wanted to order the amristsari fish but they said they did not have any fish yesterday. Finally ended up ordering a chicken hariyali boneless. Now it was good to note that for the chicken dishes there was an option to order a full (8 pieces) or half (4 pieces) option which was perfect as i was the only non-veg in my family. We also ordered 2 glasses of sweet lassi to go with it.  The lassis arrived quickly and it was smooth and nice...though not the original punjabi ""malai marke"". The starters also arrived quickly. Another unique thing i noticed was that though all 3 dishes we ordered were tandoori, it seems to have been sauted in some oil on a pan after the tandoori cooking. Paneer Tikka : Nice and soft with large pieces of capsicum and onion. Medium diced piece of paneer with a strong ajwain flavor. All of us liked it ! Mushroom Tikka : Again the tandoori cooked mushrooms which has been sauted afterwards. I liked the flavors...again ajwain being a prominent flavor. My wife said it was ok...not as good as she has had elsewhere Chicken Hariyali : Had ordered a half portion, but i could count at least 7-8 medium sized pieces in there. Nice green masala coated soft grilled chicken. Liked it a lot and i polished it off in no time... For mains we ordered palak paneer, dal makhani, butter kulcha, a lachcha paratha and an amritsari kulcha. Palak paneer : Nice flavors...spicy...not so bright green in color which indicated that they've cooked this with lots of spices unlike in other places. We could trace ground red chillies which gave it a nice hot punch. Dal Makhani : One of the best we've had...very good...authentic flavors. Butter Kulcha : I did not try it but my daughter liked it. Lachcha Paratha : Was ok...oily. Amritsari Kulcha : Now this was a winner for all of us...realized that one is too small and not enough...we ordered 2 more..it had a nice onion and aloo filling..not at all like the aloo paratha  filling. One of the best we've had anywhere !  Finally ordered 2 glasses of buttter milk/chaas to wash it all down and it was ok...but the masalas in it were course ground and i could feel it irritating my throat as i drank it. I think they need to either make it more fine ground or filter it out !  My daughter had a portion of hot gulab jamuns which was very good..with a thick sugar syrup.  Could not finish the food...and we packed the remaining palak paneer, dal makhani and 1.5 amritsari kulchas. My daughter promptly asked for the same to be re-heated for breakfast today morning and she polished it off in no time. Said it was still yummy !  Overall we all liked the food a lot. The service also was very good and prompt for the crowd. Found many big tables with 10 or more people.  All of this cost is around 1350...which is ok for the no. of dishes we ordered by certainly not cheap.  Overall rating : 3.5/5  Ambiance : 3/5 Service : 3.5/5 Food : 4.5/5 VFM : 3/5  Highly recommended for a down to earth no frills authentic punjabi food experience !                                             bangalorefoodie.com"
4.0,"Went to this restaurant on 5th Juy 2013, last friday. Located opposite to Punjab National bank, near to Indiranagar BDA complex, this one is easy to locate.  I had been to this restauarnt few months back, but didn't find it good. But, now they have improved a lot. I ordered, Vegetable Tikki which was made of Soya. It was a good one to start. The highlight was Punjabi Malamaal, I had asked the waiter to make it more spicy, and I believe that had done the magic. This dish was simply, AWESOME and DELICIOUS. Butter Naan and Onion stuffed kulcha were - at expectations. These were followed by Masala Rice, I was expecting this to be accompanied with Raitha, but the waiter said that they don't serve Raitha for Masala Rice :( this should be noted down. We ended up with Sweet Lassi and Masala Cold Drink.  And finally the big one, BILL, came around Rs.691 which was economical enough. I will recommend this restaurant for everyone looking for authentic Punjabi food in and around Indiranagar."
4.0,Typical punjabi ambience. Food is healthy and tasty. Service is excellent. Overall experience is great for a punjabi joint.
4.0,"This is what we call ""value for money"" restaurant.. It might not have best of ambiance.. but it has all d ingredients for what you actually go to restaurant and that is food!!..  you can enjoy a good food and even normal water (with mint leafs inside.. i like it visually and taste wise).. with all said it doesn't have every item top notch.. but still enough to rate it 4star.. so if you are looking for a regular spot which is reasonably priced with good quality Punjabi food.. also finishing touch with eating paan at d door gives a fulfilling experience of eating.."
4.5,"I had heard good things about this place and myself and my wife dropped in while we visited Indiranagar this weekend. Since it was our first visit there, we just tried out a few dishes recommended by the waiter.   For the starters, we tried out Chicken Afghani and for the main course, we ordered Tandoori Rotis, Punjabi Paneer and Chicken Lababdar. (apart from our standard sweet lime soda that we always order). The restaurant was heavily packed (being a Saturday night peak hour) and the dishes took some time to come , but when they did arrive they were indeed worth the wait. :-)   . The Afghani chicken (which is basically grilled chicken then buttered and treated with spices)  was absolutely delicious, being the succulent and completely melt in the mouth type. Both of us were just bowled over by this dish. The Punjabi Paneer was an extraordinary medley of flavours, and I thoroughly enjoyed it , though my wife found it quite a bit spicy. A note of warning , this dish is only for people who like very spicy food(waiter had informed that in advance), others might find it very hot. The Chicken Lababdar was delicious, with soft morsels of chicken in a yummy gravy. Both the paneer and the chicken went very well with the Tandoori Roti.  The ambience of the restaurant is basic, with nothing fancy about it.  Contrary to what I have read in some reviews, we found the service quite good, and the waiters tried to accommodate us as best as they could in a busy Saturday evening.    The total bill came to Rs 750, which is very reasonable in a place like  Indiranagar. The serving sizes were large, and what we had ordered for two would have easily sufficed three persons.   Based on our experience, we would definitely like to go back and explore the other dishes on the menu.  Here are my ratings : Ambience - 7/10 Food - 9/10 Service - 8/10 VFM - 9/10  Overall Rating - 9/10"
4.0,Authentic punjabi food in the heart of indranagar! And it's not as expensive as Lajawab either.  Disclaimer: expect heavy doses of butter and cream in all kinds of gravy
1.0,This is a mixed review. Food is good but service is not good. it will take more time as you have never expected. and the guy who take the order has no manner how to talk with customer. Once you made the order u can't change the order or cancel the order in any case.
4.0,"This place was in my list for a while... but i was very comfortable with my regular punjabi joint that i didnot want to try this out..also the photos on zomato made me rethink about this place.  However finally i went with my husband this week and we decided to make this our pujabi adda after tasting the food. As long as the food is great i donot think too much about the ambiance ( which can be changed a bit)  The owner has put in lot of thought into every single details from basic drinking water to the menus... I found everything fresh and tasty. The interior looks ok but the kites are very distractive and noisy , but who cares about that when we were engrossed in the food .   The service was surprisingly fast and the menu list is exhaustive . Overall a decent punjabi joint around the area . I cannot remember anything that was not to my satisfaction.   I find them using paneer a lot in all the veg items ... not sure if this is due to skyhigh veg price... If you are a weight watcher , think before you choose your menu.  Their flavoured lassi is a must to try.   Food :   4.5 /5  Service :  4.5 /5 Ambiance : 3.5 / 5 Friendliness : 3.5 /5 Accessibilty : 4 / 5"
3.5,"This is My first review about any Restaurant in Bangalore.So i will start with 3 areas :-  1-ambiance :- Its a small but nice place decorated with kites and different shades of light. The total area is divided in two sector one is with big TV and simple chairs and Table which is kind of looking soothing.2nd one is more comfy with Sofa .  2-Food :- i will give 3.5 star to food for both veg and Non veg.I went with my group so in starter we order chicken tandoori(soft and tasty ),chicken achari(must try ) and Paneer Achari (Quantity is less but As Good as Chicken Achari). MainCourse:-we had Malai kofta(Average),Chicken tikka Masala(not good as compare to other places) and kulcha and Rotis .So overall Starter is better then main Course.  3-Service is fast and They serve in Copper Steel Thali and Glasses which look classy.  Price:-350 Per head including Taxes.Overall nice Experience"
4.0,"Well, we went to this place today. We were a group of 9 people for  a birthday treat and it turned out to be totally awesome. I read the reviews about this place before on Zomato and was a little sceptical about it but to my surprise it was a treat for the taste buds. We ordered both veg and non-veg (P.S. I am a vegetarian). The paneer here as mentioned in all the reviews is the best. The softest and the best.   Here is what we ordered:  Vegetarian- Starters- Paneer tikka(4/5), Paneer Shashlik(5/5), Tomato Soup(3.5/5), Monchow Soup(3/5) Main course- Kaju Masala(4.5/5), Nagada Paneer(4/5), Daal Makhani(4.5/5) Naans(4/5), Tandoori rotis(4/5)  Non-vegetarian- Starters- Afghani Chicken(3/5) Main course- Special Rasoi Chicken(4/5), Fish Curry(4.5/5), Chicken Biriyani(4.5/5)  The ambiance was also good enough. Might not be as pleasing to people but I liked it. There was a layer of kites on the roof and the sitting arrangement was good.  The service didn't seem to be bad at all as I had read in the other reviews. You have to be pleasant to the people who serve you.   Overall, I'll surely go to this place again and definitely recommend this place to everyone. Best food."
4.0,"This is a place I finally visited after reading all the great reviews n my father's persistence. N since it was Father's day n I had to treat him....I gave in.We did a take away...n had the food at a family friend's home. Starters were.... Chicken Malai tikka n Amritsari fish. The first was a melt in your mouth suculent piece of meat which was awesome.The next...fish was a surprise in terms of it having a gravy n not at all like a starter. But still must say even though we ended up having it with garlic naan it was superb. For the mains it was... Patiala Paneer, Dal Makhani n Chicken Lababdar. The paneer....I must say in a long time in Bangalore city in a restaurant I have had paneer so soft n yummy. A perfect blend of everything was the Dal Makhani....loaded with a tonne if butter,ghee n malai...wow...it tasted awesome with the naan n rice alike.Then the chicken...what a perfect taste...blend of spice was just perfect n full of flavor. Overall in terms of authentic flavors this place delivers in loads...it is the genuine deal.And in terms of cost...very very reasonable...all of this was just over 1k...n served 4 of us. So must say its a perfect place which is genuinely a ""Punjabi Rasoi""."
3.5,"The bad one first, We had ordered some Veg soup, which turned out to be Boiled veggies, pepper and some red chillies powder and water.. The Biryani isnt the greatest either. Apart from these 2 items i have not had an issue with any other items that i have ordered. Service can be improved a bit but its still good enough."
4.5,"Food: Tasty is the word. All the dishes that we  ordered had the typical desi flavor. The food was very high on taste and oil. Paneer, which is usually hard/stale/bland at many places was surprisingly well cooked, soft and had layers of flavors.  Shining stars: Aam Panna, Chicken Chaat, Paneer Achari, Chicken Maalamal, Paneer, Punjabi Paneer and the green chutney served along with the starters.   Ambiance: Go only if your aim is to enjoy food because this place won't score too high on ambiance. They pay great attention towards preparing dishes but sadly this attention is so much that they don't seem to focus on finer aspects that could make it an even greater place to eat and enjoy.  ONE OF THE VERY FEW PLACES WERE VEG IS AS GOOD AS NON VEG!  Tip: Food is really heavy so keep a bed handy. :P  Suggestion: @PunjabiRasoi Please pay attention towards keeping your washroom clean."
2.5,Its just like any other dhaba kind of restaurants. Food is ok but sometimes very oily and spicy. Kebabs are nice and best is the Lassi they serve. Good home delivery options with long list of menu. If you are looking for a normal eat-out option then this place is you can opt for.
3.5,Food is excellent so is services; I find its authentic Punjabi taste and only missing thing is alcohol :) ....defiantly recommended place if you are fond of Punjabi/North Indian food
4.5,"""value fot money"" and it does not strip off ur pockets. Food is not outstanding; but good. Hot & Sour chicken soup is awesome!"
4.0,"One of the few places serving good North Indian food in Bangalore. Just love the chicken out there. Built in an interesting way with kites on the roof. Service not up to the mark - Either they should get more waiters to cater to the rush they have or the current waiters should be trained well to take care of all the customers. That being said, it still remains my favorite place to have some good Punjabi Food,"
4.0,"What's good: Good food (Any item I ordered in my last 3-4 visits are pretty good - can't complain) Quick service Value for money.  What can improve: Ambiance (though it's not that bad, it can still be improved) Home delivery (service at restaurant is pretty quick, but home delivery is ridiculously slow 2-3 hours sometimes)"
3.5,"I got the food home delivered...so I can talk only about the food here. The stuff cam decently packed, and in reasonable time (approx 50 mins). Loved there tangri kebabs, though they were not the most authentic of stuff- rolled in some white gravy, but none the less, they tasted good. The dal makhni was better than any that I have had in Bangalore. The paneer gravy was a tad too oily. The breads were pretty decent. The serving sizes were quite ample for three of us. Would definitely be visiting the place to check out more."
3.5,"Ask for a Punjabi restaurant and you get a perfect one when you land in Punjabi Rasoi. Tried a couple of times and every time it gets better. They have a great spread of varieties in both veg & non-veg and it does taste pretty good.  If you are going for veg, 'Sarso ka Saag' is a must try. You will find a bit tangy in taste but that's the way it is! In non-veg there is a large spread so you can try every time new. Take my word nothing will disappoint you.  In dessert there is not much of innovative item. Just old fashion stuff. Tried their Matka Kulfi there.....big NO NO!!! It was already melted and seemed only half served in the plastic 'Matka'. Better you can go for Lassi.....proper Punjabi one!  When it comes to cost, you won't spend more than 500/- for two(guys with heavy diet like me Lolzz). Whatever you do, don't ever leave from that place without having the Saunf (Fennel) at end. It's as good as the food you taste.  Rating: Ambience: 2.5 Food: 4.5 Service: 3 Overall: 3.5"
3.5,Never been to the restaurant but I have ordered food from here loads of times... I like the food here but the service of theirs for the home delivery is something they should try and improve on... They used to be on time till recently.... Also nowadays the person who takes the orders seems to be an arrogant guy!!!   But if you want to enjoy good food.... This is a real good place to order from....
4.0,"This is among the best place which is known for the Punjabi food in Bangalore. I have visited their HSR and Indiranagar branch. The place is good, squeezed in space, but serving awesome food along with a nice service."
3.5,This one is a good place if you are looking for inexpensive dining options. North Indian food is decent (but could have been bit less oily). Amicable ambiance with polite staffs. Being inexpensive is probably one of the USP's of the place.
3.0,"Food was okay... just about average. Ambience is good. The time I visited not much crowd, so service was excellent, not sure when it's crowded. Value of money is average. Overall recommendation -- hit of miss.. try at your own risk."
4.0,"Good Punjabi Food, this place gets too crowded almost all the times, cos its so popular for its rich taste.  do not forget to have lassi, dal makhni, ahcari paneer they are so yummy. their naan, rotis are vey soft and nicely done."
4.0,"As they say in Hindi. ""sasta, sundar, tikau khaana"" if ur craving some dilli ka rajindar da dhaaba/ Pandara road types khaana... Go to this place... And guess what.. Its killer cheap!! Word of advice - its punjabi rasoi, so stick to punju dishes..."
4.0,Had been there based on reviews and ratings found here. First we ordered manchow soup which was not upto the mark. Next on our platter was paneer peshawari tikka n chicken malai tikka...both were amazingly tasty....The quality OF paneer is the best I have ever tasted.Even the main course rotis n kulchas with the paneer gravy were good. I would recommend u to taste the paneer...jus melts in ur mouth....Ambience jus okie....service s pretty good...my suggestion s try it once and you wont regret! Also better 2 avoid chinese fare!
1.0,"Pathetic Place. May food tastes good, but not a decent place for decent people. Moreover the guy who sits at the counter, seems to be the owner is unpolished and full of attitude. as if he owns ITC chain. huh..   The place was crowded, and he asked me to wait for 5 mins , I came out like a gentle man and waited in the waiting area where he has put some dirty seats, in the mean while people keep coming and getting places to eat, When I told him about this, he started misbehaving.   Place for people who dont have dignity and only follow their tongue. Learned a lesson not to go to such CHEAP places. If some 1 says its a fine dining place, he does not know what fine dining is .  1 more think mister owner, mind it and remember it, people who become success in any endeavor become polite. Try to digest it, if your dhaba business is running good, dont insult your customers, they are the 1 who sustain u. I HOPE U REMEMBER ME NOW. That time u forgot my face in 15 mins time, i hope u dont have a memory loss problem."
1.0,"ordered a home delivery today..was told it will take 40-45 mins. The order never came after 1.5 hrs, finally when I called up for the 3rd time to check, the guy on phone had no clue.  when i asked to cancel the order, got a reply "" as you please"" with no sense of apology for delay.  disgusted."
1.0,"one of worst places to eat in. the service is bad and the food tastes like saw dust. especially the veg people need to beware before goin there, you might get served non-veg and wat's more u ll even get billed for it, if u do not agree to pay for it u will be abused."
3.0,"Good food, Great service,  Soft paneer , good lassi , smooth dal makhani, perfect roti,lacha parata , and stuffed kulcha ,  good portion size,"
3.5,"One of the best Punjabi Food in town with basic ambience and great taste. They have 2 more branches at RT Nagar and HSR Layout. I simply love the Punjabi food here as it reminds me of north Indian Punjabi taste rare to find in Bangalore. It is difficult to point out few dishes from its menu as most of the dishes are good in taste and portioning. Only dish I did not like was Chicken Kali mirch ( from Lucknow). Its a good value for money place that will satisfy your soul and mind :) If you have never been here , please do vist this place or its branches in Bangalore. My rating ambience 2.5 food 4.5 sevice 3.0 overall 3.5/5                                                                 thefoodietales.com"
1.0,this place has the worst customer service!!! the owner is very high headed and rude.Because of his rude attitude the food quality has gone down and it is served cold to customers..Once a Punjabi paradise and now hell!!
1.0,Pathetic service. Guy whoz sitting to take order has absolutely no patience to repeat the order. most of the time order will not reach properly.
4.0,"I have been frequenting Punjabi Rasoi for 2 years now and have completely fallen in love with the food here, not only have they maintained the same quality and quantity since I first visited but their prices also rarely fluctuate. The food is so authentically Punjabi - and this is coming from someone (Me! :P ) who lived in Chandigarh! I had always craved the soft paneer that was so readily available in Chandigarh and was realllyyy pleasantly surprised when I tried the paneer here. Their non vegetarian dishes also have really great quantity and are cooked to perfection - not the usual doze of rubbery chicken served as starters! I have taken a lot of friends here to try the food out and everyone has only good things to say about Punjabi Rasoi!   :)"
3.5,"Till now i have been there 3 times & it was a good experience with me & my friends. Well food is good , i would like to say that some where i feel typical punjabi cusine.  Cost : 500 for 2 person Worth For Money: True Ambiance: Good Food Quality: Good"
4.0,"If you are looking for a resto with Punjabi food which isn't too heavy, not too oily n makes yu feel like that made at home.. This is the right place... They don't add unncessary excessive masala.. Hence, yu can eat a lot happily ;) I had dal makhni, paneer pasanda, tandoori roti n ghee rice.. loved it all.. The ambience is not great... but the food n cost make up for it..."
4.5,Went for lunch here with a frnd and i must say that this place is really great. for starters we ordered nargisi chicken and afghani chicken and both were delicious. For main course we ordered chicken malamaal which i have to say was the spiciest dish that i have had till now in bangalore and it tasted great.Also we ordered chicken lababdaar which was also equally good. Lachcha paratha and butter naan were great as well. We ordered lassi as well which was good but can be better. Finally had a meetha pan just outside the restaurant which was quite good too. The waiters are well trained and very helpful. Ambience can be improved but still a big thumbs up to this place.. I recommend
4.0,"I find this place to be easy on wallet. I have always ordered ""paneer shashlik"" and never got disappointed. Both veg and non-veg items are pretty good. Though I found fish related items only average. Lassi gives you the feel of Punjab :)  However, it always has a waiting time of 15-20 minutes (definitely on weekends). Ambiance is average.  Overall, the place is very good. I would definitely recommend it.  Happy eating !! :)"
3.0,"Place is little difficult to find,took me 3 days to figure out where exactly this place was :-) But when i finally located this place & it was ""Value for Money"" has ""OK"" ambiance but good food."
4.0,Amazing north indian food. Try mutton punjabi in main course and chicken achaari starter Kofta and paneer tikka masala also good. affordable and decent place.
4.0,"Great place that serves great food. The food is simply awesome and it tastes really great. Both veg and non veg is great and this is the place to have great North Indian food. They add much spices and oil to the food and this makes it taste really great.  The ambiance of the place I can say is average but not that bad. Its hard to find this place in the crowded clustered town area, but once inside it, it is big enough. People may have to wait for some time to get seats if you haven't reserved in advance.  The price might seem a little on the high side, but it is worth for the taste of the food. The dishes are rich and filling. Their biriyanis and Indian breads are also really great.  I would recommend this place."
2.0,"As usual we had to wait for the table. We ordered some garlic naan and a chicken gravy (I don't remember the dish name), only thing which kept me going was the taste which was good when we had to dine in all the UN clean plates and glasses.   when we consider about the quality of the restaurants, which also includes the ambiance, I still give 2/5 rating for THE PUNJABI RASOI and it is one of my favorites. looking forward to dine here again with high expectations of some changes in the restaurant's environment."
3.0,I am not very foody but this place is nice and food is great.............
5.0,simply awesome food..best punjabi/north indian i ever had in bangalore
3.0,Had been for lunch in the HSR layout branch nice food good lassi Kofta is a must try breads are really nice NIICE Place...affordable rates
4.0,awesome food.. being a punjabi i think this place taste is closest to punjabi street food...
3.0,I had bin here for lunch with my sis.D ambience is nice& cool.We had ordered fish amristari fish vch was marinated in tandoor well tasted&had ordred chicken tika vch was also gud.D main course v opted for chicken makhani with tandoori roti bt chicken makhani was sour tasted bad& later v went for punjabi lassi vch tasted yummy...Overall gud experience...
1.0,Ridiculously oily food. Bad experience. the waiter forgot abt the drink i ordered. And the place wasn't very clean. The negative points completely overshadow any good ones (not that there were many). NOT recommended.
4.0,"very good food, good service and rates are very reasonable. for 2 members bill wont exceed more than 500."
4.0,"Like they say 'Sasta aur Tikau' - Reasonable and Decent.  The first thing you  notice when you enter the restaurant is the ceiling covered with colorful kites!  The Menu had a variety of options for Veg and Non-Veg both.  We ordered the Vegetable Platter and wow it was a huge platter with Panner Tikka, Aloo Bharwa, Mushrooms, Veg Kebab and assorted vegetables. I must point out that the paneer was amazing! Super soft! Dont really get that kind of paneer everywhere! For main course we tried the Navratna Korma, its sweet in flavour and well made here. Also the kadhai paneer was delicious. A proper punjabi/mughlai dinner.  If in mood for a nice punjabi dinner which is light on the pocket, this is the place."
5.0,"A very nice place to dine with family and friends since they have renovated the ambience quite nicely.We had been to this place last evening with a group of punjabi food lovers who actually thanked me for the choice made .The starters are quite juicy and tasty ,the khandhari chicken and chicken chaat are out of this world,for main course the dal makhani and chicken maalamal were quite tasty the chicken was tender and juicy.All together a very nice experience  .Would definitely recommend the place."
2.0,"There is no complaint about the food..but the attitude of the person at the counter is really bad.There is something called as hospitality and someone needs to teach this guy some of it. Now, coming to the food, it is nice, cheap and affordable. Goes well with taste buds as well your wallet. Only rarely have i had any thing to crib about their food..one time, they made the chole...i guess with the oil from some pickle, it was horribly spicy.   The worst part of their service is the time they take to make home deliveries. They take like 2 hours and serve you soggy rotis and almost dead curry..Would never be a good idea to order food when you are hungry. please order around noon so that they deliver for dinner :("
1.0,"This place is not clean, we had little cockroaches crawling up & down our table while having lunch. So we really colud not enjoy the lunch. surely will not recommend, let alone go back....never."
1.0,"To start, the very first thing that either attracts or repels you is the ambience around as well as the cleanliness inside the restaurant. I would give it 1/10 for cleanliness as the plates and glasses did not appear to be clean. Food quality is decent with the correct amount of spice you would expect in a Punjabi restaurant, but nothing amazing compared to the other punjabi restaurants in town. Service and the behaviour of the owner towards the customers is intolerable. I will never recommend anyone to go to this place"
2.0,"I ordered a few dishes from this place for home delivery. It included mutton curry , missi roti and egg biriyani . First of all the it took 1.5 hrs for the food to get delivered at home . The mutton curry had 3 pieces and all were 80% bones. The gravy had so much oil that i had to throw most of it."
3.0,The food quality and taste is good but the ambience is just ok. Highly recommended if you do not bother much about the ambience and care about the taste and authenticity. Lassi is really good and so is the taste of North Indian dishes.
4.0,Very nice food and great service. Need to wait a bit on weekend but worth it. very authentic
2.0,"Food is good here, no doubt. And it is used to be good value for money earlier. Still we cant deny the fact that the owner and the manager are rude."
3.0,"When you are in Indiranagar, and you want to grab a decent north indian meal, without burning a hole in your pocket - reach out here. I have seen them go from a 30 seater (+30 waiting) capacity to a 60 seater (with 5-10 waiting). And from 1 to 3 outlets (right, guys?). They know how to make dal makhni, rajma chawal, crisp tandoori rotis and, wait for it, LASSI, in Bangalore like nobody else.  The crew is soft spoken and well trained, but don't expect too much on ambiance."
3.0,"I have had the chance of going to this outlet of Punjabi Rasoi just once. However, the food is way better than the one provided at the HSR Layout. I had been recommended to try out the dal and its good. Lack of ambiance and space is a negative for the resto. Also they can do better in the time they take to deliver the food."
4.0,"Been there at least 100 hundred times .. At times i never had to wait and at times 30 mins .. This place has never disappointed me !!  Tomato Duniya Shorba, Malai Chicken and Garam Garam Rotiz my favorites !!  Its not great with ambiance, its not great with hospitality !!.. Frankly all the foodiez know that ..Tip a waiter well and smile .. you always will get best of the Hospitality from then On !!  Its awesome value for money and all the review about stale food is untrue .. try your luck at around 10 in the night ...minimum wait time is 30 mins .. they can't afford stale food :) !!"
5.0,"Has been a mouth-watering place for me. I've been going to this place for the past 4 Years! Yes the rates have increased from Rs.80 to Rs.150 (acceptable) for gravies. Yes the new waiters are bad. But wait, the taste remains the same. Beautiful place to eat, this has been."
1.0,"do you want to get food poisoning?? If yes, then Punjabi Rasoi is the place for u!!!!   this is the worst experience I have had!   First they cancelled our table booking for the team lunch because we happened to be five minutes late. then they made us wait outside for an hour before getting 2 tables together. We waited another 20 minutes for another table to get empty, but the waiters were in a big hurry and served up the vegetarian dishes to the non-veg guys as they were the ones who were seated and the vegetarians in the team were waiting for the third table to be made ready.   The waiters and manager are pretty ill-mannered too.   The food was below average at best. I have eaten much better food for lesser price in other places.   But the best thing is that the entire team fell sick the next day!! we all had food poisoning symptoms and this is not the way we need to end up after a team celebration!"
1.0,"If you want to get dirt for asking how long the will it take for the food to get delivered, then this is just the place for you!   Dear Mr. Guy on the Phone, one may be running a big restaurant and making money and pleasing taste buds, but if he/she doesn't have the decency to talk, then all the jazz that you do, falls flat.  So, No. I don't own Bangalore Mr. guy on the Phone. You need to stop believing that YOU do. It was like having a conversation with a child. You may claim to know hospitality Sir, but believe your 'customer', you don't!   For those who don't know what I am talking about here, this person from Punjabi Rasoi was extremely rude and inappropriate on the phone with me.  And I am not the only one saying it; read reviews below! :)"
1.0,"Do not order Home Delivery. They do not deliver on time and the excuse is that they have other orders to deliver or the classic we were cleaning. The worst part is that they always and always argue saying that they are right. Food might be good but, what is the point when you have to wait like they are doing you a favor. Packaging is a mess with oil dripping in the cover, which makes it look disgusting when you accept it. Good the promoter is going to Australia. hopefully when back he learns the essence of time and that the ""customer is always right."""
4.0,"Went for lunch today to Punjabi Rasoi with my team and had a great time and enjoyed the dishes served which were authentic and delicious. We ordered Chicken Chat for starters which was hot, spicy and juicy. In the main course Dal Makhani and Patiala Paneer were just brilliant."
1.0,"Hi Guys --i cannot agree more with the outrageous reviews of this restaurant, funny that it was recommended by a somebody. We ordered home delivery and the chicken  turned out stale for which we complained immediately . The the standard reply there i understand now is  '' served to 100 CUSTOMERS since morning '' and ''no one complains''. The replacement turned up after 2 hours and the surprise is the owner landed up at our doorstep --abusing us in the middle of the night defending his food and creating a ruckus. I think this kind of arrogance , cocky and cheap behavior from any restauranteur claiming a 20 years exp ( !!)is an insult to the industry . This place should be scrapped of his license (i.e  if he has any) and be shut down immediately.. Hope Burp , Zomato and all other considering this place are READING this coz i surely am gonna spread the word ."
1.0,"WELL WHERE DO I START WITH.....FIRSTLY I WOULD ASK ALL ""NEVER"" TO EVER GO TO PUNJABI RASOI...ITS A HORRIBLE  PLACE TO GO TO. WE WENT THERE FOR BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION AND INDEED THEY MADE IT SOO MEMORABLE...THANKS TO THE ARROGANT,MISBEHAVING, MANNER LESS OWNER(GUY WITH A FRENCH BEARD...PLEASE NEVER TALK TO HIM..AS IT WOULD MEAN TO INSULT YOURSELF) AND THE CONFUSED,SLOPPY AND MANNER LESS STAFF(OFF-COURSE INSPIRED BY THE OWNER). WHEN WE TOLD THE WAITER THE CHUTNEY THEY SERVED WAS STALE AND WAS SMELLING BAD....HE CAME BACK WITH THE SAME CHUTNEY DENYING IT TO BE BAD....AND WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE MANAGER WELL THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY...""I KNOW THAT THE CHUTNEY IS BAD BUT THEN I HAVE SERVED IT ON ALL TABLES AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN PAY THE BILL AND GO""...YES THIS A BURP CERTIFIED PLACE AND THIS IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE COCKY OWNER WHO SAYS HE HAS BEEN IN THIS INDUSTRY SINCE 20 YEARS...WELL THEN IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT HOW YOU BEHAVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS. THIS PLACE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN AND THE CHEAP OWNER SHOULD TAKE OUT HIS FRUSTRATION SOME WHERE ELSE BECAUSE THIS SERVICE INDUSTRY JUST DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM IN ANYWAY"
3.0,ok... as i read the other reviews.. i felt a little bad...  My experience with Punjabi Rasoi was wonderful. the place is not too clean... and is a lil crowded... but the food is simply awesome! the paneer maalamaal is superb!  Nargisi chicken is also a must try! overall i liked the place ...
1.0,"Recently we visited this so called authentic Punjabi Restaurant. The plates were not clean so weren't the glasses. We ordered two non-veg starters which were good. For main course we ordered Mutton Roganjosh. It was stale, the gravy was smelling like 4 day old waste. When complained, the owner came and said ""There is no problem with the food, if you are not able to eat it then its your problem. I've been running this business for 20 years and I would not serve bad food to any one."" I politely asked for the bill and we left. Bill also had things we never ordered, got it corrected. Worst experience in recent times. Bad staff, worst behavior I have ever experienced by any owner of a restaurant. I would never go there again and will not recommend anyone to go there."
4.0,"Punjabi Rasoi was recommended by a friend long back, and the way she described about the food... I was eagerly waiting for an opportunity to visit the place. And boy, what a visit it was! :) Though the ambience is not much to write about...and the fact that it's quite tucked away on the first floor of a building, but I guess that is the worst I can write about the place, because as far as food's concerned, Punjabi Rasoi wins hands down! In fact, I'll now go the extent of saying that this is the best Punjabi food I've tasted in Bangalore! Though we visited in a busy weekend afternoon, we got a place to sit and ordered (with the help of a very helpful waiter). Starter was Amritsari Fish and it was to die for! Usually I am skeptical about ordering fish dish in a new place... since you cannot be very sure about the freshness, but we took the risk and it was worth paid off. I'm a person who likes non-veg Indian food to be on the spicier side and Amritsari Fish was a delight. But faint hearted people, beware! :) Main course was Chicken Patiyala and Chicken Lababdar. The latter one is a must try! We ordered Lassi - both types, salty & sweet and were quite impressed with it. And the good part (of course apart from the scrumptious food) is the service. Waiters are busy, but they are willing to describe about a dish, if you ask. And the time taken to serve is not much. The only regret - didn't try their famed Paneer starters, but then, I'm definitely going back there again!"
1.0,"The lady in RT brnach is a cheat, she always try to cheat her customers. Cheap Stuff but just wanted to keep everyone Aware, indira nagar branch is better,....Quality as well as quantity ash gone down over the years specially after moving from there actual place.... Now then are just trying to break even by milking custoemrs on pricing .... am writing this after 2 instances where they charged us more compared to there latest menu...... you complain to them about price they will day they increased price..... Arragance personified but this will not last long as other good places are coming up in RT nagar...... Avoid this place if you have a choice else keep this place last in your list to visit....."
5.0,"The ambiance is not very great. But the Food is totally delicious....!!! Perfect North-Indian Cuisine. For non-vegetarians, you should try the Chicken Nargisi & Chicken Achari. The flavor, the gravy, the chicken....superb!! For vegetarians, you definitely gotta have the Paneer here. The Paneer is super soft and very delicious. This place is for complete foodies.....people who don't mind indulging in food."
4.0,"I came to Bangalore in Oct 2010 and was staying in company guest house in Indiranagar. After few days of Dinner at the guest house, my search for some North Indian food landed me here. I am a vegetarian and found the food to be just awesome as compared to few other places I tried.  To me, if a restaurant has tasty Dal Makhni, other things on the menu are bound to be good. And I was correct once again. Dal was just too good, comparable to any decent hotel in Delhi.  Though a little congested but the taste of the food makes you forget that. Few things I would recommend are Dal Makhni, Dum aalo, Paneer chatpata.   Now that I live about 30 kms away from the place, but still I make it a point to come here once in one or 2 months."
4.0,"This is a pretty decent place. On first looks you might not be impressed as the ambiance is not so good. It looks like a house turned into a restaurant. But the food is very good and the prices are decent. If you are non-veg, do try the chicken chaat there."
5.0,Guys I would like to disclose reality of Punjabi Rasoi Food. This place is really great! Food is awesome. Punjabi Rasoi Food having real North Indian Taste. They serve food in pleasant way.  Total Paisa wasool.
3.0,"When this mean paneer craving bugs the hell out of you , you should land at this place. No matter what you order you just have to eat their Paneer appetizer. As cliche as it sounds paneer tikka is what you ought to try when you are at this place. Paneer just melts away in your month and spices are not too over powering.If you really wanna go for some authentic 'sounding' Punjabi food, you can try makki ki roti and sarson ka saag. But what I saw was some green leaves mash swimming in oil/butter and tasted just about ok. My Punjabi friends agreed too. So, again go there for paneer. Sheesh, I can't get over their paneer tikka, I need help!"
5.0,"Awesome food. The perfect place for Punjabi food. The food was the best north Indian fare I have had in Bangalore. Each item was distinct and tasted great. It certainly is the most underrated restaurant in Bangalore. You wont regret your decision to go there, trust me! Do try the lassi and rogan josh."
5.0,"Best food is a myth. They say and we believe. When my friends were praising about the food I thought they are just fooling around and over hyped the place. So finally I went and ordered. The paneer was so soft that a needle can break it in 2 pieces. All the dishes taste differently. No mixing of different gravy happened. We ordered Pudina chicken and that was the best pudina chicken I ever had. No comparison with Tandoori chicken they prepare apart from my dad's preparation :D Now I am veggi and repent my decision everytime I go there. Next time I was in love with Methi malai matter. The food is so great that the color, smell and arrangement, perfect mix of all the spices can mesmerize anyone. I saved myself from writing this review because I dont want this place to be famous and loose on quality that they have. Now everytime we go there, we order and love to experiment on new dishes. If you are a foodie, go for it.    PS: Dont miss to have Lassi at the end."
4.0,"Ambiance is not that great, looks like a residence, as in old television shows, turned into a restaurant.  But the food is awesome. One of the best north Indian restaurant in bangalore. Chicken is a little spicy though.  Everything else was just perfect, especially the veg item Methi Malai Mutter. Dal Makhni is also one of the best I have tasted in Bangalore. The best part I like about the place is that it offers chapati/tawa roti/phulka which I was missing for the past 5 months. Not that costly if you go only for the main course, which is filling and awesome. The only bad point about the place is that service is a little slow."
