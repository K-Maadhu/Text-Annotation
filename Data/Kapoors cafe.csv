4.0,"Visited this place after 3 years nearly. There wasnt much change in the ambience, it was decent with all punjabi themed posters and seating wasnt that comfortable. Coming to food, taste still remained great as it was. Ordered Lassi(4/5), masala cold drink (5/5) - this was super tasty with right amount to masala added to pepsi, roasted papad(4/5), gobi pakora(3/5)- this wasnt that great, seemed more like cooked gobi directly placed into fried balls, methi khastha paratha (5/5)- this was the best and  perfect, onion paratha (5/5) this was quite tasty  too, bhini pyaza (4/5) - taste was fine but it was very oily."
4.0,"Went here on one of my friend's suggestion and I think it was a good place to enjoy food.Taste wise Yes It was really good,some items I felt were very oily. The service is fast and they are very cooperative and polite. Ambiance wise nice with a good number of people around."
3.0,"Went here after a long time on a sunday afternoon.  Food: 3/5 - The food no doubt is tasty. It has always been. But the thing that i noticed this time was that the food was super oily. We had ordered baigan bharta and kofta along with dhaba dal. The kofta was full of oil. Infact there was more oil than the gravy.  Ambiance: 3/5 - Well the place is almost like it was 4 years back. That is the charm. But then comfort wise not the most comfortable place.  Service: 4/5 - considering the crowd, the service was good."
5.0,"This is typical Punjab dhaba types cafe Punjabi loud music is playing all the time. We ordered paneer paratha and lassi , it is value for money the amount of butter they put is deal breaker . Even the lassi quantity and quality is great . In short great place to go for a north Indian guy."
3.0,"I tried the Rajma Combo, Lssi Patiala glass. Having a tastebud accustomed to Punjabi food in Delhi, the Rajma chawal was flavorful, but, did not seem to hit with the zing I'm accustomed to. The menu warned about ""extra spice , oil n ghee"" and tells you to request them to keep it low if we do not like it. But, seemed otherwise that mentioning to serve extra spicy was necessary. The Lssi was thick, smooth and delicious. The clay glass adds to the flavor. The XXL glass was quiet filling in itself. The onions served with the Rajma Combo had thawed, and felt like it wasn't chopped fresh. Overall, the prices are too much considering the ambience isn't great. I paid INR378 for this meal. It's typical dhaba style setup (maybe intentional to keep up with the dhaba culture). Ideal for office groups, friends groups. Didn't seem apt for family or romantic dates. 180 for the Lssi still boderlines ""worth it"", but 230 for Rajma Chawal in a not so fine dine restaurant was a big turn off. Quantity was good, this meal could have fed 2 people just right. Service was too slow, seemed like they're more focused on the SWIGGy and Zomato delivery queues ."
4.0,"This place has a story which connects you with its food and You can also realize it. So talking about food Paratha are the best part and here and You would be full by a single one even. We ordered Gobhi Paratha, Lacha Paratha and Kadhai Paneer (Spicy) and along with that butter milk. Awesome food, It tasted totally North Indian. Though the place stays crowded as they are very good but its worth waiting. So I would highly recommend to try food here."
5.0,"Didn't visit this place in person but ordered food from here once. The food is just amazing! First, had Green Peas Paratha and then Cheese Balls. Paratha was too good! Cheese Balls were nice. And last, I had their Lassi. It was great! Worth trying food from here! Food:- 5/5 Value for Money:- 5/5"
5.0,"This place is heaven for north indians who orders food every day. Delhi wale chole buthure is a must try from this place, may be try the special lassi in kulhad. A combination which will remind you the streets of delhi. I never visited this place, always ordered it from swiggy, but it seems to be a fun place. Loved this place and food. Happy to have it near my home."
5.0,"If you are in Bangalore and you didn't visit Kapoor's Cafe then you are not enjoying Bangalore. One of the best places in Bangalore. The food is really very tasty and hygienic as well. If talking about the ambience, if you are Punjabi or not you will love the ambience. There are many attractive wall hangings. They keep on playing Punjabi songs. I had four dishes 1. Cheese burst paratha 2. Pindi Chole Bhatura 3. Patiyala Chaas 4. Patiala Lassi You may superb crowd on weekends. The service is also super fast. The owner Arpit Kapoor is the best owner I have ever met. Must Visit"
1.0,"Full wastage of money..all the dishes are unnecessarily costly and really bad in taste..I will recommend not to visit this place for food, as you are going to be disappointed"
4.0,You will get nice flavours of Punjab over here. The cripsy cheese balls were really awesome.. full cheesy.. The Aloo parathas were huge and one is enough to fill your stomach. The lassi is just awesome.. and it will be served in a big mitthi k glass. Nice place to try .. value for money and it's not that expensive..
3.0,"It's one of the most crowded places in Bangalore. You will need to wait in the queue and it's very overhyped I would say. The Fruit lassi was good but the parathas (Aloo, Gobhi) were okayish, didn't find it out of the world. Sarso ka saag and makke ki roti is supposed to be the best thing in a Punjabi restaurant but it's not that great here. Overy expensive.  Food: 3/5 Price: 2/5 Ambiance: 2/5"
4.0,"Good Punjabi restaurant and it is a pure restaurant. Service was so quick and good. All kind of Parathas were good, matka lassi was tasty. But little disappointed with paneer pakora and shahi tukuda. Cost was very reasonable. Overall must try place."
4.0,"One thing to note is it's a PURE VEG restaurant .Superb Punjabi food. Service was quick.Do not miss their cheese parathas. One of its kind in Bangalore. Good quantity also especially the parathas are really filling.Very consistent with taste. Its little costlier for sure, but very very good food. Customer service is one of the best among those in Whitefield."
5.0,"Loved the ambience, staff was wonderful. A good place to spend some time with friends and colleagues. The food was worth the money and so flavourful !"
4.0,"We had lassi while waiting which was good , old style coolers and tight seating arrangements make you feel you have come to dhaba . But above all food was great , we had prantha and lassi ."
2.0,"Had heard a lot about this place so decided to visit it. Proved to be disappointing. Food was not upto the mark and we had to send back the paneer dish we ordered since there was hardly any salt in it. Lassi was tasty and ambience was pretty good. All in all,expected better."
5.0,The best lassi I ever had was in this cafe - Dry fruit lassi which is filled with nuts and is thick enough . The ambience is attractive and it is punjabi theme based cafe with good music .
1.0,"Wonder how does this place has 4 stars, very bad experience. Pathetic food, bad ambience ,over priced for the quality of food and ambience. Had been there for dinner today was raining and water dripping on you while having food. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone"
1.0,Had a horrible experience. It was raining and water was dripping from roof mixing with the gravy . Overpriced items . Highly unlikely to recommend others.
3.0,"Dry fruit lassi- 5/5 Cheese Patakas- 2/5 Pindi Chole Bature- 3/5  Among the three, I absolutely liked how the lassi was also delivered. Such attention to packaging!"
1.0,This is the first and very last time I ordered food from this restaurant through Swiggy. Refund my money for the item Chole Bhature which I had to throw into dustbin because food was stale and smelling
5.0,"Food: 5/5 for this place Have tried most of the items at this place...tried dine in as well as home delivery. No compromise on quality. I highly recommend: Aloo paratha, dal makhni, chole bhature, malai kofta and dry fruit lassi. But veg. only and no tandoor items...!!!  Still love the food at this place."
3.0,"This place may be good but during weekends when it is fully crowded, it is just average. Cleanliness is not that good, overpriced food, food taste was also average."
4.0,"Food is super awesome here and only vegetarian,everything floats on butter .they should rename to butterland. Portion sizes are large,being a South Indian i didnt  feel it to be too spicy."
5.0,"This is a small but elegant place in Whitefield. People staying around Whitefield are regular to this place.  I and Dinesh Kumar Agarwal visited this place and ordered two Aloo paratha which was served with loadful of fresh ghee and green chutney and onion.  The paratha was cooked very well, the stuffing was perfect in quatity and taste.  Service was great and so was the ambience. Popular Punjabi tracks were being played. Inside they have hung pretty nice quotations on Sikhism and Sikh people.  A must visit for everyone."
4.0,One of my favourite places in Bangalore. Their chole bhature is the best you'd find in the city and combine it with a nice chilled lassi and it gives you a perfect meal. A simple and very reasonable place that serves authentic Punjabi dishes.
5.0,"Great place to have some calorie rich Punjabi food. We had the cheese paratha with 6 cheese slices. Definitely the best paratha I've ever had. Their mix paratha was good too with paneer, onion and Gobi stuffing. Prices are on the higher side. But the enormous filling and huge butter dollop on top justifies the money spent. Do follow @mad.over.f00d on Instagram."
5.0,"Ordered 2 Patiala lassi , Allo puaz Pratham and one paneer paratha, taste was like the same we get in North India, Tasty it was as for the north indian staying here(costed around 430 )"
4.0,"Good north indian vegetarian food.  Must try chole kulche, stuffed parathas and gulaab jamun. They serve parathas with lot of butter on it. Over all very good food.  Food place to sit and eat with family."
3.0,Food is awesome to be honest. Staff is very friendly and courteous. But there is no AC and still prices are at par with AC restaurants. Too many tables placed just side by side due to which the place looks cramped and packed. Thats the reason 3 star from me.
5.0,"Starter                    Pure Veg    Dessert      ,"
1.0,"Except the fascinating name nothing was good here. We ordered paneer paratha, kadai paneer, veg Kolhapuri, cheese balls, kalmi sticks, paneer pulao. No aroma, flavour or good taste...literally nothing satisfied our taste buds. Very disappointed!! The price is too high for the quantity."
4.0,Good place for Punjabi food....perfect place for dinner and for paranthas....must try this place... Ambience 4/5 Taste 4/5 Service 4/5 Value for money 4/5 Overall is good experience.
4.0,"It's not a very great place to go out and eat .. I suggest ordering food at home , that way you can save some bucks and have such a great food watching your favourite TV series ;)  Soul satisfying food Lightning fast service Below average ambiance , and not worth the money :("
5.0,Truly mind blowing experience! Awesome preparations and authentic punjabi taste!   Punjabi songs and ambience are amazing!  The only place I think to enjoy hot buttery authentic parathas!   MUST TRY!
4.0,"You love food and a lot of butter on it, this is the place you are searching. They have bunch of Punjabi dishes with really good taste quality. Try parathaas especially cheese burst parathaa and also try Pindi chole. And damn you got to have a good appetite to finish it."
5.0,Kapoor's cafe is one of the best places known for their PARANTHAS MAKKHAN MAARKE! Delicious food! Must try their desserts! Ambience is average.
3.0,"Had been to this place a couple of times! Amazong chola bhatura served at breakfast,one paratha is way too heavy!!!served with loads of butter:p. A nice authentic punjabi taste!"
2.0,"Had lunch yesterday at Kapoors whitefield. Really surprised by the hype they have created for such a below average preparation. Ordered matar paneer thali and Pindi chole bhature. Any restaurant with its salt , especially when it claims to be punjabi restaurant should be able to do decent justice with  chole bhature , they sucked big time at it ! Super oily bhature that disintegrated the moment it became a little cold , see the picture as a testimony of Bhatures transformation into bread flakes dripping in oil. Chole was okay , tad bit saltier than it should have been. Matar paneer was more of paneer do pyaza, very thick gooey gravy with undercooked frozen matar and some small paneer pieces here and there. When pointed to Kapoor uncle , he said this is how its is made - with a lots of defiance. I pity myself for being so uneducated and inexperienced when it comes to how an ideal matar paneer should taste/ look like. It was an education for me , on top of heart burn that I had after eating at Kapoors. Advice to the restaurant management- enjoy while the fun lasts , people will make out sooner or later that 280 rs thaali is not worth it"
4.0,"We visited this restaurant on 9th February.  We had ordered Poori Aloo for our son and Makki Roti with Sarson ki Saag, Parathas and Pulao for us.  The portion size was good. Taste and Presentation were excellent.  Lavish use of Butter in all dishes was evident.  We enjoyed the meal thoroughly."
5.0,"This place os heaven for food lovers. You will find the best paranthas, chole bhaturey, lassi here. Infact all the dishes are pretty amazing. This is a must must must go place in Bengaluru. It is just a small restro but the ambience is so good and the food is above heaven. They also delivery food online. I dont have pictures of food since i ate it and left no time to click pictures. Service is pretty fast."
4.0,Love the food here. Spicy with lots of smooth white butter! Yumm!! Go in a ravenous group as portions are big. Meant for those with a robust appetite and strong digestive system. :-)  Ambience and general look and upkeep could be much better.
1.0,"Highly dissapointed with food quality and taste. With a sky high price tag, it's simply a mockery in name of authentic Punjabi food. This place used to serve good food 2 years back. Now it's simply charging 5 star hotel prices, serving something really not worth a penny."
5.0,"Taste of the food is very nice. Ambience is also good. One must try the Paranthas, paneer curry, dry fruit lassi and butter milk patiala glass."
5.0,"Awesome lassi and poori sabzi, and the decor and ambience is quite desi, this place is the perfect spot for your hunger pangs. A must visit."
2.0,Used to be one of the favorite places in Whitefield but had a bad experience where the table we were seated on had cockroaches running around under the counter and got onto the plate. I get the dhaba feel but still hygiene needs to be improved in the restaurant.
4.0,Had been to this place for lunch and actually liked the food over there. Simplistic ambience and a good choice for those who wish to keep the budget low but also have a hearty meal! It's not the best but quite authentic Punjabi taste.
4.0,Authentic Veg Punjabi food. The ambience and seating is not much but food is all Kapoors Cafe is about. Possibly the best aaloo ka paratha youll taste in the city. The bread is perfectly measured and the potato stuffing is delicious and a lot in quantity. Lots of butter over the paratha makes it even better. Lassi is good. Youll even get khasta roti here. And the Dal makhani is a perfect blend of spice and dal.
5.0,"Always first on my head for a good Punjabi Meal - Breakfast, lunch or dinner. The set up is of a typical Punjabi Restaurant with Punjabi Music making it feel like a place around Chandigarh or Delhi. Very well managed. Staff is cooperative and the food served is very delicious. If you have a craving for good Punjabi food, this is the place to go"
4.0,"Cheese paratha 5/5 Butter milk 5/5 Lassi 2/5 Chole bhature 4/5 Cheese balls 4/5  Tasty food try butter milk ,lassi was more like sweet yogurd Overall 4.5/5"
4.0,"Its an authentic punjabi restaurant i feel, i found aaloo parantha really yumm and food also carries the taste that we search for. Must try"
5.0,Best place for veg food!! in love with the parathas and lassi.. True taste of north indian food in bangalore.. ma ke haath ke khaane ki yaad dilaati hain!!
3.0,Ambience - 3/5 Nothing great to be written about.  Food- 3/5 Didn't like anything much other than the aloo paratha.  Price - 3/5 Doesn't match the food provided.
5.0,Amazing place. Delicious food.Polite and friendly staff. Parathas and lassi is the specialty of this place. Tried all varieties of parathas and the taste is amazing. Punjabi style French fries is also amazing.
5.0,Authentic Punjabi restaurant... A dhaba type experience.... The seasonal Sarson ka saag was awesome... The parathas were loaded with butter and awesome in taste
4.0,"This has to be a must visit place for every Parantha Lover. I have visited this place 3 times till now and this review was long pending. My personal favourite Parantha of what they offer has to be Aloo Pyaaz and Paneer Parantha. You get a lump of Butter on top of the Parantha. Along with it you get Coriander Chutney. It's quite heavy (Parantha+Makhan).  One of their signature items also include the Lassi that they serve in Kulhad. One should not give it a miss. The side dishes that they offer are a bit expensive but the quantity of the dish covers for that. The service is fast and it's quite pocket friendly.  For Punjabi Food that too Vegetarian, one must visit this one!"
5.0,"Balle balle....the true Punjabi style food...so dear vegetarians here is the best pure vegetarian restaurant option for you...quite good dhaba style ambience...yummy food...fast service..heavy rush on weekends so plan accordingly...no matter whatever you try you will for sure will say yummy...friendly staff ...do try the patiala lassi...one patiala glass is sufficient for two people...all stuff paratas...very heavy and big in size with lot of butter..starters good option are Punjabi style french fries (Punjabi style version of Peri peri fries) veg cheese stick, Punjabi veg stick, cheese balls, main course lababdar paneer sarson ka saag, makke ki roti, and best was khasta parathan..all portion are big be it any gravy or parathas so order accordingly...a must try and highly recommended restaurant."
4.0,Omg....love with the food here.... perfect place for dinner and for parathas....must try this place.... Ambience 4 Value for money 4 Service 3 Taste 5
5.0,The taste of the food was breathtaking. The price may seem a bit higher than other restaurants but you frankly get twice the value. The Lassi was very thick and super awesome. The staff were courteous and the owner/manager was very good. Had a great experience. It's sould food!
4.0,"Superb Punjabi food. Service was quick. Ambience is quite average, but the quality and quantity of food is decent. Can visit once in a while for authentic Punjabi taste"
5.0,"Winter specials like makke ki roti with sarson ka saag and jaggery are to die for foods. Extremely soft makke ki roti. Kulhad wali lassi, Alu gobhi ki sabzi... Waah waah Only caveat is how to get off the table once you have had your full.. Wish they could also provide khatiya to have a short snooze post the meal!! Keep up the good work guys.."
4.0,"I ordered paneer parantha and patiala lassi , both of them were good and filling! A pudina chutney will any day make me happy! The service was good and timely. If you have any complaint with the food they readily make sure it is rectified. Only thing I wished they had were the charpais"
5.0,typical punjabi food. must try the lassi. parathas r great but if u wana try an indoitalian comb do go for the cheese burst paratha its realllllllly vvvvv heavy to finish one of that paratha. must try place go for a bike ride n have dinner.
5.0,Best punjabi food I have ever had. The parathas are fantastic and the lassi is a must have at this place. The pricing is very reasonable and the service is good  Food- 5/5 Service- 4.5/5 Ambience- 4/5
3.0,"our new year started with this place been there around and had to wait for almost 30 min to get our turn.  place was totally crowded and thanks to the management, that they had managed it very well.  Tried aloo onion and gobi parata. both were tasting great along with their signature sweet lassi.  found a curry which is similar to palak and asked the staff to get the same.he mentioned, its their special and called as sarso da saag with makhan.  to be honest, it was not really tasting great and we had to go with one more aloo gobi for our main course to get over.  final shock was with the magai paan, that we took. the bill surprised us by marking the amount as 60 rupees per paan.  anyways felt this place was really expensive when compared with the taste and quality they provide.  taste: 3/5 cost 2/5 ambience: 3.5/5"
1.0,"We visited the place today and asked for less spicy food. Waiter suggested paneer do pyaza which was full of garam masala, on complaint instead of replacing food they added cream to it  Never seen a restaurant which charges so much and reprepares customers food in it's kitchen (such unhygienic practice to modify food which is consumed ) instead of preparing fresh one Even re-preared food was bad . We left the restaurant after politely paying our bill.  Disastrous customer service and a don't care attitude ."
2.0,"Paratha's were amazing, but boondi raita had a oily taste due to boondi - must be old. Sarsoo da saag was not good. 550 rs for this was waste."
1.0,Hope zomato will add minus stars now . Overhyped and over priced place. Dal makhni is of 270 rupees.. chilli paratha was good which earned that one star from me.
2.0,This is my second visit to Kapoors Cafe and i have been dissapoined both the times... We ordered choley bhature gobhi parantha and aloo pyaaz parantha with Chaaj and masala cold drink.. Taste of the choley was not at all palatable.. Seems to much of onions in the masala made it verry sweet and u can taste the raw uncooked masalas.... Out of two bhaturas one was raw from one side had to send it back ..!! Masala chaj was too watery never ever tasted some thing like this ever at home or ne reasturant up north.. They served so called masala cold drink which was warm and too much of masala and size of the drinkk hmmm ... Heard a lot about them but looks like an over prized Punjabi boasting reasturant nuthin much punjabi about it other than the loud posters on the walls.. !!
5.0,Searching for authentic vegetarian Punjabi food? This is the best. The parathas were out of the world; especially matar paratha. Lassi was delicious and dal tadka was just fab. The courteous staff adds more to your dining experience.
3.0,"Good punjabi food but not a great place for dine out.  Food - 4/5 : Nice food. Quality and quantity both are up to the mark. Service - 3/5 : Staff is good and helpful but they take a little long to serve, mainly due to rush. Ambiance - 3/5 : Okish. Not so great. Can go with friends to enjoy the food but not a great place for a date."
5.0,Not a fancy place but this place does some serious talking when it comes to food. Amazing Punjabi food for quite reasonable price. Must have their lassi and paranthas
4.0,Very nice place to hangout with friends as well as with family. Nice service and quick service. Parathas are good as well as the lassi in kullad is best .
1.0,Very bad food. Seems like they use the same gravy for the whole week or maybe more than that. Also the price doesn't meet the expectation. Won't recommend!!
1.0,"Visited on 23rd dec and food was very poor/below average in terms of taste, quality and also cleanliness on and around table. Worst food I had in any restaurant in 2018"
3.0,"The quality of food and ambience has got down but the prices keep going up. As for today, it is certainly not the value for money. We ordered cheese balls to start, which were good. Next we ordered aloo pyaz paratha and cheese burst paratha. Aloo pyaz paratha was good but cheese paratha was not good. The amount was cheese was not living up to the name - cheese 'burst'. It also lacked the taste. Lassi was good but they have increased the prices a lot.  P.S. - the washroom is not clean.  Taste - 3.5/5 Service/ ambience - 3.5/5 Value for money - 2.5/5"
5.0,Had visited kapoors cafe last weekend for lunch. It was a good experience. Food was awesome with lots of butter( but that comes with a authentic Punjabi food). Loved the food so much that visited this place twice in a weekend.  Great job guys!! Will surely come back soon
5.0,Really a good place for Punjabi food lovers. The paratha's and lassi are the best I've had in Bangalore. The service is really quick irrespective of the crowd. Taste- 5/5 Ambience- 4/5 Service- 4/5 Cleanliness- 4/5 Must visit place for Punjabi food lovers. Do give a try for any paratha and lassi. Don't underestimate the quantity of food. Feels less when you order but fills the tummy too soon
4.0,"Superb Punjabi food. Mouth watering food and foot tapping punbaji music. I love the lassi and aloo paratha. Butter along with paratha makes it so tasty. The only thing I don't like is there menu book, it's very shabby. You may have to order using the menu book and done with it and then go wash ur hand."
5.0,"If you are in the mood for some authentic Punjabi food, this has to be your go to place. The ambience and seating are ordinary with some witty messages on the walls. Its the amazing taste which makes this place special. Add to it some genuine Punjabi music. Must have : Lassi served in a kulhad which is so thick you have to eat it."
4.0,"Kapoor's Cafe is a pure veg restaurant located near Kundalahalli. It serves authentic Punjabi and North Indian Dishes. If you want to eat delicious vegetarian North Indian food then this is the place for you. The place is always crowded and people wait in queues to have food there.  Ambience : The ambience of the place is like a typical Punjabi Dhaba. You get the feeling of Punjab when you enter the place. There is a nice aroma of butter over the place. One thing I felt that the place is small and as the restaurant does not have an AC it feels more congested.  Food : As I mentioned earlier the place serves delicious North Indian vegetarian food. The place is known for it's delicious Parathas which are served with a blob of butter - one is enough for dinner... The taste of the food is like typical Punjabi food. This place also serves Lassi which is amazing. I have also tried a few curries like Baigan ka bharta, Kadai paneer, Dal tadka and all taste awesome.  Service : The staff is polite and courteous and service is quick.  Pricing : Pricing is reasonable as per the taste of the food.  Must try : Aloo Paratha, Aloo Pyaz paratha, Lassi , french fries, Kadai paneer, Baigan ka bharta.  Request everyone to visit this place if you want to taste good north Indian food."
5.0,"Anyone will love this place who loves Punjabi food.  Colourful and cheery ambience just like dhabha.  They have delicious paratha with butter rolling all over which can be paired be desi lassi or chanch. Loved it.  We ordered paneer , aloo paratha, poori sabji, masala papad, Chanch and masala cold drink. Don't forget to try their signature french fries.  Food:5/5 Ambience:5/5 Service:5/5"
5.0,Best VEG North Indian food.. Loved the lassis and paratha.. Quick service inspite of waiting crowd. They should definitely open more outlets.
5.0,"This place serves one of the best North Indian vegetarian dishes in Bangalore! It gives you the right Punjabi feel as soon as you enter this place.  For drinks, we have tried patiala lassi and buttermilk. Both the drinks are refreshing and tasty.  For starters, we have tried pyaaz pakoda and Punjabi style french fries. The French fries were really different, spicy and tasted amazing.  In main course, we have tried kadhai paneer, paneer butter masala, paneer lababdaar, pindi chole, dal makhani, chole, rajma and baigan ka bharta. None of them disappointed us.  Paranthas are really good here. Have tried khasta parantha, pudhina khasta parantha, chilly onion parantha, cheese burst parantha and aloo pyaaz parantha. The paranthas are worth the money. They serve it to you with white butter.  The quality and quantity of the food they serve is top notch. You'll leave this place gaining a few kilos :P"
5.0,Wow wow wow...Never felt so happy for having Veg food...Butter over all those parathas..never ever you can see...Cheese parathas are the very good replacement of Pizzas... Actually they are better than pizzas in a very Indian way.
2.0,"Food is ok. But the front entrance and approach road is very very dirty, there is a huge heap of garbage just in the front. We also saw a dead rat right in front of the restaurant. The restaurant should do something about it."
4.0,"Never got chance to stop your vehicle at Dhabas in highways?? No problem... the great punjabi dhaba comes into your city... this place is very better than many other dhabas you been through. Trust me many dhabas will make artificial things to make you feel you are sitting In a punjabi dhaba. But this one, before you coming into this place only you may feel you are reaching Punjab  but when you are planning on a weekend evening with friends, OOPS!! You have to wait for 30 mins atleast to get. Table for you. Service is 5* food is 5* bill is 4* very clumsy arranged tables and no proper wash room felt me giving this place a overall 4* experience."
1.0,One of the most over hyped places I have ever visited in Bangalore. I had really high hopes from this place after hearing nice things from some of my friends but utterly disappointed. This place is very very very costly for the quality of food they offer. Ambiance is just okay more like a local mess who offer food. The food was not that bad but the hype and the cost just didnt justify.
3.0,"Ambience is very normal. Punjabi dishes are really good. I think they lot of msg. Ordered naun, rotis and paneer and chicken gravy items. Felt not much worth for money. Quality and quantity also can be improved. Finally ordered lassi which is 100/- and got it small mutka pot. Taste is very regular but not worth at all. Usually Punjabi dhaba they give bigger glass of lassi, but here it is quite opposite.Kapoor's Cafe"
3.0,"A friend recommended to try this place out so decided to give it a shot. We ordered Chole which were Kabuli Chana dipped in 100 GM's of Garam masala, no original taste, got a heart burn. With Chhole, we decided to order a dish that was on sweeter side to compliment it so we ordered Paneer Lababdar. It was pretty ordinaru. Nothing authentic Punjabi about the taste of these dishes. From outside it comes off as a Govtschool in a village"
4.0,Brilliant punjabi aloo paratha and lassi Ive ever tasted in Bangalore! Simple desi ambiance.  Peas paratha is also worth a try.  Good service.
5.0,"This place is a great place for North India Punjabi people. They serve very very good paranthas, dal makhani, bhindi do pyaza, I only have one problem they dont deliver at our address in whitefield, thats my bad."
4.0,"Best place to have Punjabi paratha in Bangalore. Great ambiance ,i like the posters that have kept with Punjabi tag lines .Really good place to have North Indian food with friends and family."
4.0,Nice food. Sarso saag n makke di roti were good. Not the best but really good as compared to what we get in bangalore. Loved the white butter. Not particularly happy with the parathas (specially aloo and aloo pyaaz. Paneer paratha is yummy) they offer. They can be better. But value for money and yummy food. love their gravies. I would love to go again n again.
3.0,Taste of the food here is just amazing. Their Lassi is worth visiting this place. But pricing is but high for its ambience and the place is also not very clean. Kapoors cafe at Kalyan Nagar is very good in terms of its ambience.
4.0,I ordered Pindi chole bhature and french fries in Punjabi style ...both tasted amazing. These are most crispy fries I have ever eaten.. I am also eaten it's aloo pyaaz Parantha it is must try ..
1.0,"Food served was not tasty at all. They do not bother about customer request. Worst experience, better if you are planning search for other restaurant. I was very hungry and came back empty stomach"
4.0,Best parathas I have had recently! Delicious and you will be ravenous soon after you get into the restaurant! Thick and tasty lassi. Dont miss it! Great food for perfect price.
1.0,I have ordered many times from here but I see the quality sliding down dangerously. I have suffered stomach upsets and indigestion after eating food from here particularly the rice and even pindi chole which was pretty stale and old. Pls avoid if you care for your health.
1.0,It is a over-hyped place and the price was not at all reasonable. Pricing does not in sync with the quality. If u r a cheesy guy then this place is for you
4.0,"Went here for lunch. You can find nice authentic North Indian food here, though prices are on little bit higher side but still quality matters !!!"
3.0,I think some places are very overrated... I'll say this is also little bit .. Especially taste is not truly North Indian what they mention..may be parathas which I didn't tried...by a decent place none the less
4.0,"Food is delicious. I couldn't eat two alu onion parathas. They were so heavy with a lot of stuffing and dullops of butter poured on. The food tasted so yummy but I struggled to complete. The dry fruit Lassi is amazing. They do justice to the name. However this place won't have a great ambience, think of a dhaba look. Also the staff would not suggest the serving size unless we insist and ask. You may fail initially choosing the quantity but will learn on for further visits."
4.0,Perfect place to have Punjabi comfort food Love their dal makhani. Warning: your food will have dollops of ghee and butter so better forget your diet before you end up here.
4.0,"Great place for college crowd and paratha lovers. The lassi is okay vs the cost but parathas are simply awesome. The dollops of butter add to the flavor. Must order is aloo paratha, their chaach, mix paratha and cheese paratha. You could also add some gravy items to enhance the taste but the serving of achar and other sides should do the trick. The place is bit shady and difficult to spot though. Ample parking and buzz available."
4.0,If you are craving for a hearty punjabi meal head this place. It's a pure veg restaurant with interiors resembling a dhaba. Kapoor's cafe of known for their parathas and lassi - so don't give them a miss. They serve wonderful combos and a la carte vegetable curries and rotis. The portion size is huge - so please consider this while you order. The place is very crowded on weekends. Weekdays are manageable - one can easily find a seating here. One qualm - the food is spicy and the parathas come with huge quantities of butter.
3.0,"Had heard from my friends about this place so had to try. We ordered lassi, cheese balls, Allo paratha and the winter combo( sarso ka saag, makke ki roti, Ghar ka makkan and jaggery). The cheese balls, Allo paratha and the lassi were good enough but the winter combo was just ok, not worth it."
5.0,"After seeing very good reviews in zomato been here yesterday. Though the reviews were good it looked 'too good and hyped' so I was little skeptical. But I can now tell you that the reviews about this place is totally true.  Ambience & staff:  This place is located in varthur HAL main road. Rustic ambience, good hospitality and the staff helped us choose from the sea of options available. He was also patient enough to clear all my doubts regarding the dishes.  Food & pricing: The food was amazing. If you are looking to try an authentic punjabi cuisine then this is the right place. The dishes are moderately priced but worth the price.  Must try:  Lassi, cheese pakkoda, masala pappad"
4.0,"A good restaurant, to have classic food ,Parathas ,lassi everything is palatable here full of taste, a full hardcore Punjabi restaurant, It's not pocket friendly . Nice ambience , quality food ."
4.0,"Well, people in my group have been talking about this place for a long time and finally I visited this place last weekend. I didn't see the pictures of the place before going but I had an image of a posh cafe sorta place in my mind. It was nothing like that when I visited the place. It is better. It has that desi feel of North Indian restaurents. Talking about the food, we ordered a cheese pataka balls in starters and it wasn't up to the mark. It was barely hot and the taste wasn't good either. I don't recommend it. This place is famous for their paranthas and lassi and we tried our hands onto them as well. Trust me, this is one of the best place if you wanna have aloo pyaaz parantha. I orderd that and I am pretty sure the other paranthas must also be the same. Probably the best paranthas in bangalore. At least I have never had this good paranthas in bangalore. And the lassi after the paranthas works like a cherry on top. The place has a good punjabi/delhi-ite ambience with punjabi slogans and posters over the walls. The hygiene of the place is also good. Must try the aloo pyaaz parantha with lassi."
5.0,"We ordered panjabi dal tadka thali and aloo pyaz paratha , dry fruit lassi.All were very tasty. Service was very nice. Staff was also friendly."
4.0,"This place has improved since my last visit which was around 5 months back. Good food, great taste and decent quantity. We ordered mushroom masala, paneer butter masala, daal tadka, phulka and kulcha (not the tandoori type, it is more like bread). The above review is only for main course, I personally don't like their starters and feel it's a waste of money. Service still needs improvement as few of the staff seems to be forgetful and needs reminder. Like other restaurants, they don't serve food in plate apparently it's not their custom."
2.0,"After reading the raving reviews I ordered food today and it was a let down. Let us start with the food, it looks fabulous, but the taste buds are left craving. There is absolutely no North Indian flavour to it. Pindi Chole look colourful but taste bland, potatoes served with it are sweet and disappointing. In Aloo Puri, Poori was good, but Aloo was straight up disappointing. For the exorbitant price thats being charged, its not worth it. I would like people to really lower your expectations below ground level, and be prepared to be disappointed, or have a local delicacy at A2B."
4.0,You will get that Punjabi dhaba feel when you enter here.Its an heaven for vegetarians.Beware of the extra ghee they put in if you are on a diet.One shouldn't miss the lassi they offer.Its really tasty.
1.0,"Awful experience rude staff bad food stale saunf far far from authentic punjabi waste of money, no value for customers I wasted my money please don't vist and don't trust other people's review."
1.0,"Quality has started to drop down, as they have already made quite a few bucks i guess. They simply do not give two sh!ts about customers now. Was served stale milk product sweet dish. They denied it was stale till the last minute. Try their chawal kheer and shahi tukda at your own risk."
4.0,"A descent punjabi themed restaurant, with good service and good food  My order and its review- Masala papad- very good, especially the spices were too good  Combo 6- Daal Makhni, Kadai Paneer, Boondi Raita, 3 Ghee Phulka, Matar Pulao, Masala Papad, Lassi, Shahi Tukda - The combo was good, paneer and daal were amazing but shahi tukda and lassi  were average.  Aaloo Paratha- Very good- Loaded with too much of Butter, which undoubtedly improved the taste.  Gobhi Paratha- Very good.  Over all great experience, but the food was very heavy due to so much of butter and was also high on the spice end."
4.0,"We ordered cheese pakoda , cheese paratha , aaloo paratha and gobhi paratha. Cheese pakoda were damn spicy and tasted really good. Cheese paratha and aaloo paratha were too good. 4 stars for food 4 stars for ambience and hygiene"
4.0,please correct your opening time on Zomato.  As mentioned 10:00 am but generally it opens around 11:00 Every day. People need to wait unnecessary
4.0,The best place indulge in lots of butter and cheese guilt and forget about it because of the food being amazingly delicious! They serve one of the best parathas in the entire city. And provide with a hell lot of choices as well.
4.0,"If you need to have authentic punjabi food in whitefield, this is for you. The ambience is not that good but the food covers it for you. But still Kalyan nagar outlet is better than this."
1.0,The experience here was not good at all. We ordered onion pakoda it was not properly cooked from inside we asked the waiter to replace it he said they can't replace it. We even got a hair inside the food. Will not recommend it at all.
1.0,I have tried kachori chole and poori aloo. Kachori was crispy and packed very well(only bcoz restaurant takes extra packaging charges). raita was good but I did not like chole as it was way too oily and sweet and I did not like that as chole are meant to be teekhe/chatpate. Price is high and taste is poor. poori in aloo poori was too crispy that it was crumbling and difficult to eat and the aloo sabji was full of oil with no sign of any edible gravy.Not worth at all and Never ordering again.
2.0,"Decent place for north indian food. The food is slightly sweet, like they prepare in Gujarat and Maharashtra. North Indian food is definitely not sweet. Lassi and tea were too sweet. Ambiance is very rusty. Prices are comparable to other such places in Bangalore. Does not have dedicated parking. On top of that sign in front of the restaurant says no parking."
1.0,"Difficult to locate. Okay ambience. This is going to be my first and last visit. Malai kofta ordered was the worst ever in my life. Even self cooked kofta in home taste much better than this. It was over fried from outside and difficult to break. On letting the cook know about this, response was this is the way kofta is cooked. On speaking with manager, no appropriate action was taken. Seems like only money making is the process for this restaurant now, not customer service oriented. Highly overrated."
3.0,Nice place for a north Indian foodie.. they serve paratha overloaded with butter that is the best thing as well. . If you love spicy food they you are going to love the place. If you don't like too much spicy food then also you will love it but you will have painful after effects :p :d . Worth money place.. cheese balls are must try..
4.0,Best place in whitefield. Pure veg with delicious food  feel of north Indian food too. Paratha is very famous and is in reasonable rate. Guys go and enjoy.
5.0,Excellent restaurant with great staff. The paneer degchi was amazing. I would also recommend the Dhabe ki dal. But everything was wonderful so you can't go wrong ordering.
3.5,If you are searching for a place to have typical Punjabi food. This is the place. They have lip smacking parathas served with lots of butter on top of it. But this place is bit away from the main road with no proper infrastructure from outside. Inside ambience is fine still it can be improved as the prices here is quite expensive for the food they are serving. Do visit this place for whole new and different experience.
4.0,"Saw the rating in zomato and decided to try the place. Ordered chole combo, dal combo and lassi. Food was tasty. Service was quick. Place was a bit crowded."
3.0,It was too crowded when we had gone for dinner. Had to wait around 45 minutes to get a table. Ambience was alright. Lassi is served in kulhad and is a must try. Starters and parathas were too spicy for my taste.
4.0,"Heard so much about this place had to try it once and I loved it. A very small place in thubrahalli which has some authentic tastes. I tried their parathe, missi roti, lassi and Pindi chole and punjabi daal everything was perfect. I wished they had more options of bread like naan etc but otherwise it was fantastic. It's a must visit for all the vegetarians in town. Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5"
2.0,"Really overhyped. Being from North and used to authentic Punjabi all my life, I beg to disagree that this is the best there is. Starters really need some work. Those sticks and cheesy chilli balls. Not good. Main course, paneer lababdar was good. But just slamming a huge amount of butter on a average paratha Dosent make it authentic Punjabi"
5.0,Have some Punjabi taste buds. You can sooth them here. Rajj k khao... They serve yum paranthas and lassi.. We tried some starters as well and they were good too...
4.0,"Slightly overpriced but totally worth the taste. Loved their combos and parathas. Not to forget their irresistible dry fruits lassi, that was just blissful."
3.0,"I loved the food but the ambience was decent and the music was too loud. I would have given the food a four star had I just ordered the it home. May be people who enjoy loud decor will appreciate in-house eating more than I. But food, kudos!"
1.0,If you see their price its very high. Food is not good. In the name of punjabi food he is giving normal food. Ambiance is not good. Hard top chairs are uncomfortable. Service is not good.
4.0,"All veg; totally north Indian style and name justifies the same. Portions of the food served here is large compared to other food joints, so place order wisely. USP : all stuffed parathas topped with a large chunk of butter.."
3.0,"The ambience is alright, but the food did make up for it. While it is on the pricier side, all the gravies were mouth watering. The starters were okay in comparison. The breads were not as impressive as expected though. I was not a huge fan of the Kulcha.  The service is good and the place seemed to attract a lot of crowd."
5.0,The best Punjabi Veg restaurant in the town. The dishes were delicious. Especially I cherished the sasur ka saag. This restaurant is in top in my bucket list. I definitely visit the restaurant whenever I visit Bangalore.
5.0,"If you are looking for delicious and tempting parathas, this Punjabi restaurant is best. Awesome service and live music. The ambience is not very good compared to other outlets."
4.0,Authentic Punjabi cuisine. Mouth melting parathas..big dolop of butter on every paratha. We took cheese burst and enjoyed it thoroughly. Lassi was nice but it was not cold. Masala chaas was ok. Pricing is high..ambience is ok. Service is quick. Do visit for exclusive paratas
4.0,"Food was delicious. Budget restaurant. Quality of food is good. Felt like home cooked food. The only suggestion I would give is that too make the good little less sweet, which was bcz of cinnamon. Else must try restaurant.:)"
3.0,"This is a small Punjabi Cafe which serves good parathas with generous amount of white butter. Almost all parathas are good, cheese paratha and aloo paratha deserves special mention. Apart from it, chilli cheese balls and lassi is also good. Other than above-mentioned rest items on menu are average. Price is little high for a dhaba/ small Cafe but size of parathas justify for it. One person can't complete one paratha."
4.0,Food was spicy and proper north indian. One should must try prantha's there. Earlier they had facility for cot but now chairs are only options. Punjabi songs making that place lit.
4.0,Two words to describe: scrumptious guilt. Ordered double cheese paratha and its Indian version of cheese burst pizza. Must try Dry fruit lassi and parathas
1.0,We went this place with high expectations for dinner..we ordered chole combo and paneer pulav ..food was not testy at all.  Paneer pulav was worst ( it was just raw paneer in Jira rice )
4.0,We had been this place couple of times...all the times we had good breakfast or lunch...the parathas are so yummy with generous amount of butter on it:). We always has their lassi which is super yummy and highly recommended...their curries are good too...though all food are high in calories ... Not rated 5 as the seating area is too claustrophobic...otherwise recommended place
3.0,"This is a small cafe which has come up in place of a parking lot, it was bustling with people even though service was quick. So I thought it would be worth the wait. We got a table after waiting for 15 mins.  We started with the classic dish which is almost always ordered in places serving dhaba style food, the masala papad, which was good indeed. Then for starters we got cheese pataka balls and kalmi punjabi sticks. The cheese pataka balls were as good as it sounds, cheesy and spicy the indian way, the kalmi punjabi sticks were dry. We got dry fruit lassi and masala chaas both were good, but had higher expectations for lassi from a punjabi place. Even though it looks small it was heavy, so ppl with less appetite beware while ordering.   For main course we got pulka, chilli khasta paratha and aloo paratha, we got dal makhani and paneer labadar. Khasta paratha was again dry and hard, pulkas were good. Paneer labadar was very good but dal makhani was disappointing, no salt/spice in it.  So even though I have rated it 3, it is worth the visit, just be careful with choice while ordering. I would have given it one more star if the pricing was not on the higher side.  Ambience: 4/5 (cafe take on dhaba) Food: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Price: 3/5  Must try: Cheese pataka balls, pulkas with desi Ghee , paneer labadar  Not recommended/ needs improvement : kalmi punjabi sticks, khasta paratha"
4.0,"Getting good quality Punjabi food in Bangalore is kind of difficult which has been made easy by this restaurant. They don;t serve Non-Veg , however they have lot to offer in terms of veg and that too in enormous quantity.  We had Punjabi sticks and Punjabi style french fries in starters. Sticks were awesome and a must try, however french fries were as usual. We tried Veg Kofta which was spicy and extremely tasty. Pundinda Khasta Paratha is a must try which was huge and. Lassi was equally tasty. Quantity is not at all a issue here so do not order everything in one go. You might end up wasting food."
4.0,"An awesomely lovely place for foodies who wants to develop a taste for vegetarian food. Authentic Punjabi cuisine in an amazing ambience. The generosity shown by the restaurant in serving butter with paranthas and the kulhad of lassi will make you feel like feasting in bhatinda. The uncle sitting on the cash counter is just like your Punjabi tau ji who will ask you ""beta(child) did you enjoy your meal"" and will make you feel like home. A must go place in the locality."
5.0,"If you're looking for delicious, finger licking Punjabi Khana which will ruin your diet plan so much that you end up consuming a month's calories in a day, please head to kapoor's cafe. Amazing food and service. Hospitality is noteworthy. Cheese burst paratha was so soooooo cheesy and delicious with a huge blob of Amul butter on it that it's slightly bigger than the titanic ice berg. The kadaai Paneer thali was also so sumptuous that we didn't take a photo before attacking it like ghouls. French fries Punjabi style was so good. Chaas was good too.  Will definitely visit again and gain ten more kilos."
2.0,Overly expensive for such cheap setting. Chole bhature No where close to what you get in Delhi and guess what its double the price here..never going again.
1.0,I'm a punjabi therefore going to this place was really exciting for me. Food is decent to be honest. Infact overhyped to some level. The staff is great. But the OWNER. It was some aged man on the counter. Our bill was Rs.1344 and I had Rs.1500 in cash so preferred a cash payment. That man told us if we could use a card or had 44 bucks. But honestly none of that was possible for us.  The owner then refused to take payment and said no cash while pointing at some signboard quoting 'Use card. Avoid cash'. I said we are sorry and are not comfortable with a card. He didn't even make an attempt to check if he had change and that place is always full with people so I don't believe that he was out of change. And he didn't even negotiate like a normal person would do in such a scenario. Infact he is giving us shit like govt promotes using less cash and you still dont follow them. And then you are the same people who blame the govt. On top of that he refused paytm too. Which is the real IRONY in the case as he prefers a cashless system. When I asked him how can he refuse cash he replied he isn't and he's just asking us to avoid. I was like what do you mean? If you aren't taking cash from us how is that avoiding? Never going to that place because of that person. I know it won't make a difference to him but it will to me.
3.0,"Kapoor's cafe is one of the famous food joints in Bangalore which is extremely overcrowded during weekends. This Thubarahalli branch is located near gurukul sports which is not exactly in the main road. But i would definitely suggest you this place as it's worth visiting at least once.  The main course was delicious ,we had ordered bread kulcha which was similar to pav panfried with lot of butter. The gravies were really good especially the paneer do pyaaza which was medium spicy and veg kolhapuri was extremely spicy but was tasty as well, so all spicy lovers out there can try this one. We had ordered masala pappad ,dile Punjabi veg cutlets which was not that great and overpriced. Who returns back without lassi when you are at a Punjabi restaurant right? Infact lassi was really delicious with a light flavour of rose on top of it.  The interiors are simple and nice with few funny quotes on the wall and quiet colorful. This is a good place for hanging out with friends. The place is little conjusted I feel they could have made it more spacious. The service is really quick which is one of the best thing about this place. The manager was also friendly who made an effort to ask if we had a great time and feedback about the food. Over all it was a great experience."
1.0,Overly hyped place.Their service is too slow. Arrogant staff. Ambience is not so great. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to have decent north indian food.
5.0,Food variety - yes Food quality - good Taste - too good Affordable - yes Staff - friendly Service - fast Ambience - good Lassi - must try ;)
5.0,Wow kya kehna. Loved the restaurant. Its quite hidden from the main road but its worth a visit. The ambience is not actual dhaba style what you get to experience in HSR or Kalyan Nagar branch. The service is too good and fast. Its yummy parathas with boondi raitha are the best. Some of our favourite dishes are served only for Breakfast & Lunch so Planning to visit each week at different timings to taste all dishes. Overall very happy with the food and ambience and really good service.
4.0,"Amazing place to enjoy Punjabi meal, specifically the parathas. Very interesting messages on the wall of restaurant. Must try the lassi n variety of parathas! They are heavy on calories as they put lot of butter."
4.0,"I have ordered different types of paratha from this cafe many times and mostly, they have not disappointed me. Their speciality is the Aloo Paratha, though. It is one of the best aloo parathas I have eaten. Their main courses are also quite tasty especially the malai kofta."
4.0,A small place...neat around. Parathas and lassi are super awesome!! Go any day you feel like having super punjabi calorie heavy food  A second time visit showed the equally decadant phulkas smeared with desi ghee and dal makhani. The veg koftas are on the higher end of spice spectrum...But yummy nonetheless Place accepts cash and card
4.0,"Best Veg Punjabi Restaurant Till Date! A crowdy Place in weekends!  Must Try Aloo Paratha ( If u complete one only u r true foodie ), the amount of butter they provide Mann  #deathByButter  The Other Must Try Is French Fries Punjabi Style, a bit Overpriced but worth taste.  If U are In Punjabi Restaurant How Can lassi be not in the Plate, Mann the Dry Fruit Lassi Is Must Try here! 80% of the ""kulhad"" will be filled with rich dry Fruits"
4.0,Nice place to dine out with friends and family. Good ambience and excellent Punjabi food. Really enjoyed the meal and dry fruit lassi us a must try for everyone.
5.0,"I always love Kapoor Cafe Paneer Paratha, it is very good and recommended to all. I will suggest them to provide choice to choose in between white butter or Amul yellow butter."
5.0,"Awesome taste. Good ambience. I will surely visit this place again. I ordered Kadhai paneer combo plate, cheese patakha spicy balls and punjabi lassi. Every item was delicious."
4.0,Good North Indian food.period. Don't expect any fancy stuff here. This is a small place servering good North Indian food. Lassi is a must try
4.0,"We orders Aloo paratha, paneer paratha and dry food lassi. Every thing tastes really good. A very good and pocket friendly place. Do visit everyone."
3.0,"This place is easy to miss. Visited this place looking at the reviews and rating of the restaurant. It has a proper dhaba feel. The outside of this place and the inside look and feel are completely contrasting. You see a milestone with ""Punjab 0 km"" at the entrance. Low sheet-roof building with funky posters and decorations in a Punjabi style.  For starters we had Kalmi Punjabi sticks are basically crispy Dal Vada(Ambode) in rectangular shape. It tasted okay. Paneer pakoras aren't how you expect them to be. They aren't soft and are separated from the batter. It feels like you've eaten the crispy part and the paneer separately and paneer has no infused taste whatsoever.   For main course we had onion paratha, shahi paneer, veg kolhapuri, dal makhani and phulkas. Out of all of this, shahi paneer was the best. There was a mountain of butter (totally unnecessary because no one has so much) on the onion paratha which fills you just by looking at it.  The other two dishes were just okay.   The chaas was one thing that I actually liked at this place. It was refreshing. They give it in earthen tumblers and mutkas.   Overall, I felt this place is definitely hyped for the rating it has. Didn't impress me that much."
3.0,"Had been a week back , decent place and food . Not exactly the taste as expected of North Indian Parathas but close to it , can improve on that rest is all well ."
5.0,"Had the best North Indian food here after a pretty long time. It has a Punjabi theme entirely. The best part is the food has a homely taste. The lassi was just too good and thick and amazing. We ordered fulkas, kadai paneer and Aloo. You may tend to miss this place as you pass by as it is small and not in an obvious location. Will definitely visit Kapoor's Cafe again!!"
4.0,"Sahi mein Aasli Punjabi Khaana! Have been to their restaurant at Thubarahalli twice..the first time I visited this place it was a surprise to see a Punjabi menu on offer that is purely vegetarian. Anyone who has a craving for Punjabi Khaana would relish the tasty food here ..combo menu options are great..if you opt for ala carte..suggest finishing up with a lotta of lassi...For folks who desire a paan after food, you will be pleased to see these available right at the restaurant..Good food (albeit being a bit pricey)..parking is available making it a convenient option for a nice lunch on weekends.."
4.0,"My hunt for the best north indian fare in Bengaluru has taken me to quite a few good places, but none had the flavour punch I got from Kapoor's cafe.  Located in Whitefield, it's a decently sized place, but you could miss it if you zip by.Ambience is good, they had music playing and you can notice the distinctly Punjabi theme everywhere in the hotel.  We ordered fulkas, assorted pakoras, kadai paneer, aloo Gobhi, lassi and one aloo paratha.Kadai paneer was crazy good, lots of butter/ghee , rich and very flavorful. Aloo Gobhi was good ,the platter of pakoras were well seasoned and sprinkled with chaat masala ,it consisted of three peices each of paneer, onion and aloo pakoras.The lassi was truly one of the best I have had, served in a sort of clay/mud cup, it was just the right amount of sweet with a very smooth texture.Aloo paratha was huge, it was thick, the aloo was very well seasoned, served with a huge dollop of butter, it was lip smackingly delicious.Though the butter elevates all the dishes , the spices used make the dishes real authentic, in the fact that I haven't had this kind of taste in other places.  All in all , it was a really tasty, satisfying meal.Price wise , there was good value for money. Parking generally should not be a problem.It is a vegetarian restaurant.It has 3 other branches excluding this.Will visit again and you should too, if you are in the mood for some delicious, buttery Punjabi fare."
3.0,"Good place to visit if you want to try North Indian cuisine. Tried mixed paratha here. It comes with a stuffing of paneer, onion and aloo, with loads of butter on it. Taste was good. Lassi here is worth trying! It's quite thick and tasty. They serve it in a earthen glass which is impressive. Food : 4/5 Service : 3.5/5 Ambience : 3/5"
1.0,I ordered paneer butter masala and aloo paratha. Curry was very much spicy and aloo paratha was very average. Never got the taste of north indian food. Staff is arrogant and service was very slow despite being a weekday.
3.0,I visited this North India food junction. I have heard for this place many times. I visted Kalyan Nagar outlet way go and now its time for Whitefield Restaurant. We ordered Chicken curry along with Kulcha and Roti. Then we ordered our most favourite Sarso Ka Saag with Makki ki Roti. It was not so good. Thats why I have given less Ratings. But I would recommend to have a visit and enrich your taste buds here.
1.0,Its all hype ... they provide normal food with full of oil and not so good taste .. had ala carte and thali also both was below average ... n its famous for its paratha which is like hell thick parathas n only thing is they are giving 10 spoons of butter but I didnt went to taste butter there .. disappointed
5.0,"This is really a loved dining place and surely people should try for this restaurant, we really feel of entire staff are concerned about us and the Service is equally fast be whatever the crowd. We must try Punjabi style french fries and Matka lussy. These two are special made their dishes. We liked it all other dishes. Trust and complete and more worth and we eat more and ""Dil mange more"""
2.0,"Overrated place ! Quality not good as per expectations and name (may be multiple outlet be the problem ) . We ordered paneer pakora , masla papad , dryfruit lassi and patiyala lassi . Only lassi item was good , don't ever go for paneer pakora , it was worst I had tasted .Then we ordered chola bathura , green pees paratha and aloo puri . Only chola bathura was good ,over all not a good visit . Only good about this place is that service is very quick and staffs are very polite and well behaved.But they should give more attention to quality"
4.0,"Best PIND CHOLE BHATURE (Delhi Style) in Bangalore. Went here on a Saturday morning with the deadly Friday night's hangover and my stomach trying to pinch me from inside asking for some not so South Indian dishes. You know how the hangovers are. First, Some PATIYALA LASSI ... then we ordered two plates of the BHATURE and thought it won't be enough so tried to order two more ONION PARATHA.. but when the service guy asked who else is coming, I kept that to just 1 plate this time , we were hungry AF!!! . And finally when the BHATURE arrived we knew that that guy had a very valid question then. We didn't even manage to finish those BHATURE forget the partatha.  Taste and Service 5/5"
4.0,"So wanted to try something different after work. Kapoor's Cafe popped up and the reviews looks decent. The entrance to this place is very weird, seems like you are getting into a roadside Dhaba and the place is legit like a shed. But the lighting inside was nice and enough seating places.  While we planned to order 2- paratha's per person. The person working there suggested that we order only 1 as it was enough. Boy he was right. The Matter (Peas) paratha was amazing and super filling. The Mix Paratha was decent. Didn't have time to take a picture of the 8 cheese paratha as it was one of most amazing paratha's I have tasted. The lassi was a little different but good to the taste buds. We order masala papad while was well made too.  Overall a good experience. Food worth the money. Would have given it a 5 if not for the ambiance."
4.0,One of the best punjabi restrorant in Bangalore.. finally i visited this place.. food is very good. Price is little bit high.. We ordered chole kulcha... Chole was awesome.. Taste is like proper punjabi chole..must visit this place..
1.0,"Extra oily. Extra salty. Inadequately clean. Waiting time not justifiable. The paranthas are extra thick, not by the filling but by the uncooked aata."
4.0,"A good place for Punjabi food, the parathas has a lot of butter on it. If people like butter and ghee then this is the place, they add dullops of butter on the paratha. the lassi and butter milk is good. The overall food is good. But the seating and the restaurant doesn't look that great. It is a small hut kind hotel with tin roof on top."
1.0,"Disguisting pricing policy by the cafe which used to be a decent punjabi Restraunt known for its paratha's. Now for some reason, we are served butter with paratha at an extra cost which used to come along as complimentry with the paratha before. Increasing the prices for everything still might seem reasonable to someone but this is just pathetic."
4.0,"For a Punjabi like me a food orgasm is: White butter melting on the hot sizzling paranthas (aloo, gobhi, mix) with curd, pickles and maybe a bonus dal of your choice !!  So that's what made me try Kapoor's Cafe. Thus ordered a Aloo Parantha with white butter and Dal Makhni And I must say Parantha lovers definitely away from home will relish the authentic food they make.  But on a down side a Dal Makhni for close to 300 bucks was crazy expensive.. I would prefer a dhaba style made over a posh place like that since  Paranthas are reasonably priced considered inflation has taken a toll :D  Here's my verdict: Food/ 3.5/5 (Dal Makhni made me realise my company ain't paying me enough :D) Taste: 4.75/5 Staff: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5"
4.0,I was never a Lassi fan before I visited Kapoor's cafe. I am in love with the dry fruit lassi served here. It is so delicious and so thick filled with dry fruits. I also ordered Aaloo pyaj prantha and was surprised to see the amount of butter they serve with each prantha. The melting of butter on the hot prantha adds it own texture and you are forced to get in love with it.  Note: Do give them a call to book your table if you are planning to visit in weekends so that you don't have to wait for a long time.
3.0,"Kapoors cafe is located after kundalahalli signal on varthur Road, Thubarahalli next to Gurukul sports.  I have been there multiple times, staff is polite and responsive.  Food quality is good, and taste is authentic pure North Indian taste.  Ambiance is not so great tables, chairs are average. Sometime I feel service is slow not as per expectation.  Overall good experience."
5.0,"Chesse paratha is very good.Everyone should try. I will recommend to try chesse paratha of this restaurant to all the people.If any one is fan of North Indian Breakfast, he should go to this place."
3.0,"visited based on recommendation of a friend, found ambience not that great, but food was decent, bit over priced. Aloo parathas was good but not that great as I was told by the friend."
5.0,"The best vegetarian restaurant in town! So pocket friendly and all the dishes are delicious! My person favourites are the aloo paratha(which comes with a dollop of butter), the pindi chole and the patiala lassi! Super quick service and extremely courteous staff."
1.0,A big disappointment. Only points for ambience. 4 people and we couldn't finish 1 paratha... no no its not coz of the size but coz of the taste
1.0,"As with many restaurant , Kapoor cafe is loosing the quality factor. I ordered aloo paratha and paneer paratha yesterday hoping that - since the order is being delivered from main Kapoor cafe branch, it will be better. But it was disappointing.   If I think from quality point of view, my rating will be -1/5.  If you talk about ambiance, since I ordered through swiggy I cant comment on that. Although I have personally visited ITPL branch of Kapoor cafe and its just a average setup-So I will give 2/5  Cost- Cost allocation is pretty poor. They have reduced the price of stuffed paratha but on the other hand price of starters are really high. 120 for pakoda where as paratha costs 50-100, thats unrealistic. I will give 1/5 for Cost.  Taste: it has come down from 3/5 to 1/5"
1.0,We went here looking at good ratings on zomato. However our experience was not very great. The food was average. We ordered mutter paratha but it had too much chilly. The shahi tukda was very bad. It had raw bread in milk. When we complained the propriter lectured us on how this is shahi tukda and what we were alluding to is Shahi toast. I never heard of shahi toast. The pricing is also very high given the ambience. No AC etc. Would avoid going here.
4.0,"Great experience Everytime you visit! Tasty Punjabi food which will make you to visit here again n again Must try: Dal makhani, dry fruit lassi"
3.0,"A quick fix place to satisfy your Punjabi cravings The parathas are good loaded with butter. Patiala lassi is awesome. Dry fruit Lassi is a must have. Ambience is okay, not a fine dining place."
3.0,"Good place for north Indian punjabi food. try paratha, paneer butter masala. Over all quality can be improved. have a good time with friends and family."
4.0,"Only food no nonsense!!!  This is the first time I visited this place. I used to order regularly from swiggy. Place is not that great but place has 100% food!! We ordered verity of paratas aloo, aloo pyaz, cheese, paneer each one is better than the other. We ordered a panjabi style french fries and believe me that was one of the best french fries I had. Each parata came loaded with butter at least 250gm on it. Lassi was the best I had.  It's a veg paradise. Service is good and all the staff were polite. We had a great experience."
5.0,"My go to place whenever Im craving for an authentic punjabi dining experience. I just love everything about the place. The friendly owner, the big glass of lassi served in the mud glasses, the aloo paratha makaan maar ke and the punjabi dal combo.  Even writing about it, gets my mouth watery."
5.0,"Visited this place for lunch. Though the place was not very fancy (in ambience) but it was fully crowded, so you can understand that it's good and famous. The staff is friendly and the music played was good. We ordered for Chhole Kuche and Aloo Kachori. Both were just too amazing. Then we ordered for Lassi, it was too good. Simply loved this place!"
5.0,"I am a non- vegetarian and not really fond of pure vegetarian eateries yet this is one of those rare exceptional places where I would not mind going again and again. The service is prompt and courteous. The food is really good and full of the north-Indian charm that is so hard to find in Bangalore. I can vouch for the lassi, paneer lababdar and fulka."
4.0,"Ambience is good, we tried Combo1,combo2 amd combo4. Kachori and parathas were good, chole could have been better. The butter cube on Parathas is just wow."
5.0,The best place near to my pg. One of the cheesiest dish is cheese parantha. Must try. Even the combos were very delicious. Best place for north Indian cuisine.
1.0,The food was below average.We ordered paneer butter masala and dal tadka. Both were high in garam masala. There was no power and alternate arrangement gave up its last breath in 10 min. May be our sweating added more salt to the food. Price point is at higher side compared to the food quality and ambience. Definitely was a fist and last visit.
4.0,"This place has all the good things that come to mind when you think of North Indian food. This was the first time I went here. It's a very regular restaurant not fancy or anything. You need to come here exclusively for the food. It is 100% worth it! Ordered a variety of parathas here including aloo paratha, Gobi paratha, mixed paratha and cheese paratha. They come with a large dollop of butter on the top (forget your diet ). I was a little curious that the menu said 6 cheese paratha and 8 cheese paratha. Asked the waiter what it means and it actually means - wait for it - 6 or 8 slices of cheese stufffed into the paratha! If that isn't insane I don't know what is! We also ordered the dry fruit lassi (extremely heavy) and the Patiala lassi which comes in a big glass . They were delicious. The starters were amazing too. Very reasonable place, decent service and amazing food."
4.0,"Undoubtedly the best Punjabi restaurant in Whitefield! The best part for me was that it is a veg only restaurant.  It is at a walk-able distance from Kundanahalli Gate.   Ambience - They have tried to go for a Dhaba style but not very successful. To accommodate more number of customers they have crammed the tables very near to each other so you need to be careful when you pull out the chairs. It might be more uncomfortable if you are tall as there is no enough leg space.  They have a huge parking area so no worries.  The place gets crowded, we had been on a Sunday for dinner around 8.30pm and we were 4th on the waiting list. We got a table in about 15 mins which is not bad, by then the waiting list had gone upto 15.  The roof is a shed so it might get very hot in the noon even though they have a lot of fans.   Service - When I went to the counter to ask for a table, inspite of the crowd the manager was very polite. He gave us a number on the waiting list, assuring us a table in 10 mins and requested us to be seated in the waiting area. The staff is very agile, you can see them running to the kitchen. The person who attended us was courteous, he was speaking so fast that I had to ask him to repeat sometimes!  After you are done, they give you a number with which they generate the bill and you need to pay at the counter itself. Before generating the bill they repeat the order for us to verify.  Before leaving the manager very humbly asked for a review and thanked us for visiting!   Food -  Starter - Masala Papad, French Fries Punjabi Style  Masala Papad - The papad was small but it was tasty so we ordered another one.   French Fries Punjabi Style - The best French Fries I have had so far! It was fried perfectly and it was of very good quantity. In the menu they had mentioned that it would be spicy and it was spicy. They had garnished it with a fried chilli as well! It was served along with a mint chutney which a perfect combo! The chutney was runny it would have been better if it was a little thick.   Main Course - Aloo Paratha, Dal Makhni  Aloo Paratha - Absolutely loved it! It is aptly priced. It is so big that I struggled to finish it. The aloo filling of the paratha was yummy and it was of the right amount! They served Paratha with a big serving of butter which is more than enough for the Paratha, mint chutney and raw onion slices.   Dal Makhni - It was really good but I felt that it was over-priced.   Drinks - Chaas, Dry fruit lassi  Chaas was good, it had a flavour of jeera.   Dry fruit Lassi was completely filled with dry fruits and a cherry on the top. The texture was so soft, we enjoyed having it!   One drawback was that the quantity of both Chaas and Dry fruit lassi was less.  This is a must visit if you are a Punjabi food lover!  If you are here then please don't miss French Fries Punjabi Style, Paratha and Dry fruit Lassi but be careful with paratha, you might not be able to finish it if you have already had a lot of starters."
4.0,Authentic punjabi food The best you can ask for Yummy Parathass with butter overloaded and Lassii is what I eat here  Seating space needs to be improved. Do talk to Kapoor uncle before leaving this place.
1.0,"We ordered food from here yesterday as we had a good experience at Kapoor's HSR. Horrible food, with EXTREME masala and salt - bad tasting. Had specifically called the restaurant and asked to keep oil less. There was so much oil floating that we could have cooked for the entire party from just that. Had to throw some food away it was that bad, disappointed. Probably parathas, snack items and lassis are good but main course is BAD."
1.0,I ordered food at home. I had heard a lot good about paranthas and all its item. But I think now the quality of food is reduced so much that we had to throw the food and could not eat at all. It was half cooked paranthas that they delivered and the cheese balls were so spicy as if those were made up of just chilly. So spicy that no one in our family could eat. I would say please keep the quality check otherwise people will start moving away.
4.5,"Pro's: Food is delicious..specially the Punjabi style French fries. Service was good. Had masala papad, Lassi, phulka, kadhai panner and last but not he least..French fries with Punjabi twist... Con's: Summer Seems to take its toll on dhaba sheet shed, please walk in with extra pair of tissues and a bottle of perfume. To kapoors cafe Whitefield, please install some coolers."
1.0,"Read about the hype ,but truly failed to impress me.ambience is bad,no proper seatings,dirty, and must say food was crap.too pricey.would request people not to simply write reviews and mislead others."
5.0,"Being a Kapoor, I might sound partial towards them!! But, trust me..they deserve it all!! One of the best places for Authentic Punjabi food..do not go by their ambience..it might deceive you ;)  Must visit!"
5.0,Thank you Kapoors cafe for being there in Bangalore. Its one of the best vegetarian North Indian restaurants and hence a must visit place for a North Indian. :) The food is delicious and so filing that I want to visit the place over and over again.  Just loved it!!
5.0,"Pure veg punjabi food.  Must try paratha and dry fruit lassi, patiala lassi and  dry fruit kheer.  Parathas served with melting butter.  Should try the kulcha, soft and yammy."
5.0,"Authentic Punjabi Food in Bangalore. They have self made butter (white butter). I ordered paranthas here, they were amazing. Must visit here and should beware of other stupid Dhabas which do not even know how to make a parantha."
5.0,Do not judge a book by its cover. This hold true for this place. Do not go by their Ambience ;) They might not be the best looking restaurants in the city; but they surely are the best ones to serve Authentic North Indian Punjabi Food. Each dish on the menu is equally delicious. The staff is really humble. Love visiting this place on lazy weekend afternoons. We simply relish their Chaas and Lassi.
5.0,"Place definitely gives a very positive vibes though it is crumpled a bit , owner and the staff has great hospitality ethics hardly seen anywhere else, food will definitely excite you."
4.0,One of the best veg Punjabi restaurants in bangalore. Blindly order anything from here you'll just love it. Authentic Punjabi Taste and very friendly service.
5.0,This restaurant is really very good for Pure vegetarian guys. Taste is awesome. Price is moderate. Not high. Sweet Lassie is fantastic. Do book your table if you are planning to go on weekend.
3.0,"A must hangout place for the Delhi crowd. Perfect Non-Indian food in Bangalore. The prices are somewhat on the higher side, but the food is worth it. I personally liked the ambience too. Amidst the harsh sunshine during the noon, a comfortably dark, cool and cozy place to cool down and have a chilled lassi. Service was decent. The owner is courteous and asks for reviews regarding the food at the counter. I would definitely suggest this place to all my 'Dilli waale friends'.  Must try: Chole Bhature, Patiala Lassi  Might wanna try: Parathe  Should never try: None  Food: 3.5 Pricing: Medium Service: 4 Ambience: 3"
5.0,Punjabi special the kapoors cafe. Awesome place with great lassi and beverages to chill and the parathas are great treat with too much butter in it.
4.0,"This is a place for all the vegetarians. I'm a person who loves dhaba kind of food and this place just satisfied that.. Loved the food.. We ordered aloo paratha, cheese burst Paratha, Paneer spicy curry, onion and chilly rice and plain Lassi. I personally loved aloo paratha.. They had served with loads of butter on it and the Paneer curry was rich in spices and went very well with the paratha.. Lassi was heaven on earth.. It was very creamy and rich in its quality. Loved the ambience too.. With nice Punjabi songs in the background and the great food in front of you.. You just feel like you don't stay in bangalore.. You get the north India wala feeling. Cheers to good food"
4.0,"Started in 2014, this place has come a long way since then . All the family members are actively involved in this business and want to give each and every guest a homely experience.Top points for the service and welcome. As it is one of the most famous outlets in kundanhalli gate area,this place is always crowded.But there is no concept of table booking ,you have to walk in here and wait for a good amount of time outside on weekends.  Coming to the food  Parathas: the best thing about this place are it's parathas, properly cooked and topped with a lot of butter. Recommended parathas are the cheese paratha and the aloo paratha.  Lassi: The consistency of the lassi was very thick and the texture was creamy.Served in a kulhads and matkas these lassis are a must try. Recommended: Dry fruit lassi.  Veg kofta: The veg kofta was not a wow factor of the evening.The kofta was dry, but the good thing about this place was that even after so much crowd they have maintained the different base gravy for different items,unlike other busy joints who keep the base gravy same and change just an ingredient or two at the end.  Indian bread: Khasta paratha was yummy but instead of 4 layers it had only 2layers.And the missi roti was dry and difficult to eat.  After having dinner we went to the counter for the payment.The owner will himself inquire about what you liked and what you didn't about this place and the food.He was taking each and every compliment and complaint with a smile on his face and a promise to serve better in the future. Kudos to the staff to run this joint with full enthusiasm and zeal."
3.5,Small budget place and always jammed up with youngsters. Cheap good food is their forte. With such huge variety of North Indian foods in Bangalore it's destined to be a hit. Glad to see the prompt service and good quality of food. Interiors are little dark and gloomy. Very noisy all the time. They are best know for their parathas that they literally drench in molten butter. All in all a wonderful experience.                                                                 roshikroshona.wordpress.com
1.0,"Rating 1 cause there is no zero. They started asking for cards over cash to support digital india. Now they have reached a point of frenzy where they vehemently force you to pay only by card. They give excuses like dont have change. The owner was really rude and asked for a card as he didnt want to carry cash back home. For the restaurant owners convenience, it is okay for them to insult customers. Really annoyed!"
2.0,"I went here once and tell you they are charging too high for parantha and lassi, I dont know what they are putting in the paranta that they have priced it too high also the taste is not that great for the money we pay, just because there are less paranta restaurant in Bengaluru they are charging as per their wish."
3.0,"This place is easy to locate. the ambience is okayish, food was yum. But they do not serve the dishes onto your plates and you have to go to the reception to get your bill by yourself. We ordered cheese ball pataka, dry fruit lassi, 4 layered parathas and aloo matar paneer. Be careful with how much you order, it got too heavy for us."
4.0,"Had been to this place with a friend especially because I had heard a lot about it. We wanted to try out the menu. We ordered Fulka, Kulcha and Paneer Degchi Delhiwala(The name sounded attractive). Fulka and Sabji were good but was disappointed with Kulcha as it appeared like a small piece of pizza. We later went on to order paneer paratha. That was massive and came with lots of butter. If not for kulcha, I would have given 5/5"
1.0,"It's like ""naam bade aur darshan chote"". I went there with the expectation that it would be good but after being there starting from the ambiance, staffs and food all were pathetic. I would say its a Chinese version of great Punjabi food. The prices are very high for all the foods and drinks and taste of were too bad. Strictly not recomended"
4.0,I ordered food from Kapoor's Cafe and it was home delivery. I ordered veg pulao. Trust me I never ever had Veg pulao with almonds in it. I ordered 1plate and was sufficient for 2 people. Basically I liked the food I ordered and would rate with 4
3.5,"I had heard a lot about this place so gave a try . Went for breakfast with friends . I Love punjabi food and being a vegetarian , i Opted for Aloo paratha .  It is served with green pudina-coriander Chutney ,curd and loads of butter .The taste was very good and it was very filling . The Size of the paratha is huge .  Cost is reasonable but what i did not like about the place was the tea served and the hygiene . There was a kind of stink near the washrooms , the sink was dirty .  Food - 4.5/5 ambiance - 3.5/5 Music - 4/5 Hygiene - 3/5 Pocket Friendly - 4.5/5"
2.0,the place charges exorbitantly high prices for food which is mediocre and not that great. The restaurant is located in an unhygeinic environment which begs the question - how hygeinic is the food?
4.0,"Amazing punjabi food in bengaluru.....best part is lassi...........,..:..... amazing lassi you get at this place......thali is also pretty decent and not very expensive as well."
4.0,"I've never dined in here, only always ordered out. Irrespective of what you do or don't order from Kapoor's, if you don't order the fruit cream, you don't know what you're missing!"
4.0,"This is your destination for authentic Punjabi cuisine. Really loved the Aloo Pyaaz Paratha served with butter and green chatni. The restaurant service was good. The ambience gives the feeling of real Dhaba. Do look forward to get the homely feeling when the cashier uncle says ""Beta, khana kaisa laga?"""
3.0,"We placed the order for chole bhature (pindi chole).The pindi chole was good in taste but was little too dry but did not enjoy the bhature, which was more of a gigantic puri. Dear Kapoors, you can reduce the size of the bhature and make it more authentic on taste and texture. Our reference of authentic is either the Nagpal Chole Bhature in Lajpat Nagar or from the old delhi streets."
4.0,"After shifting in this IT park mohalla,, a reliable destination for veggie friendly people. Every alternate week I drop here with my friends, to eat chole bhatura with Pindi chole. It's so filling and panner kadhai and cheese paratha. Wow !!! KC is one such place where you don't have to give second thoughts regarding food but waiting definitely can bring second thoughts. Overall,  Price-4.0 (Bit Pricy) Quantity-4.0 ( really not enough for two people, Especially when you are with male companion)  Quality- 5.0 Ambience- 4.5"
2.5,"Went there based on zomato rating and reviews and found out that it is just over hyped! Starting from the ambience .. It was really bad wrt the hefty price you pay. It feels like sitting in a low budget road side dhaba. Dim light and unpopular punjabi songs make it worse.  Now coming to the food. We tried 2 thalis. 1. Mushroom masala Thali and  2. Rajma thali.  The quantity in both thalis was good. But food was too spicy. Mushroom masala became unbearable after a point of time. I understand their disclaimer  about spices  , ghee and oil in food but that does not mean you get served anything beyond scale. Overall not a good experience at all."
5.0,"Awesome Punjabi Food over here in Bangalore. Only vegetarian menu, Simply amazing. However sometimes waiting is more, but worth it for good food"
4.0,Their lassi and parathas are absolute delight. The big lobe of butter that sits on top of the paratha gives true punjabi experience. Food is heavy so do not order too many items. Cost is a little high for the dhaba  ambience.
4.0,one of the best authentic North Indian food. value for money.The place is crowded but staff always makes sure that you get a seat. service is pretty fast and good. Their lassi is dope
3.0,"Food is Ok nothing special, price is quiet high as compared to ambience and food. Not light on pocket, queue is always there, so u might have to wait outside in mosquito full back alley."
4.0,I am a frequent visitor of this place. Alu piaz paratha are the best over here. However you can also try pizza paratha if you like to experiment it was too much for a single person like me but yummy. Starters are not that outstanding and rest of the menu I never had the appetite to try as paratha itself is too much to take. The staff and owner are very polite but the service is a bit slow as the place is always full. If you are in Bangalore this is a place you should surely visit atleast once.
2.0,"This place is very overrated with their overpriced menu and long wait time. I really love punjabi food but here the food was below average. I ordered matar paratha and while ordering, the waiter reminded us twice that it's very spicy which it was not. Instead it was so salty that after finishing half of it me and my wife could not eat anymore. The lassi was the exception here as it was extraordinary. After being this much pricey I did not expect them to charge 15 rs just for packing a leftover paratha in aluminium foil. All in all its an average place with a very high price and zero ambiance."
4.0,"I had a tough time convincing my husband to go to an all veg place, but we are glad we went. At the entrance you will see a milestone that reads Punjab 0 Km, only ones you enter you understand it's true meaning. This place is very lively. It has a simple yet attractive set up. The staff is quick and courteous. The menu has a catchy caption, which reads something like ""butter and spices run in our veins, so if you want less inform us"". And believe me it's true. They are very generous with their servings as well as the amount of ghee and butter. But that is what adds to the taste. So if you are on diet then skip it one day . The parathas here are famous and huge. Lassi is to die for, best lassi in town. Specially the dry fruit lassi. I had to share it with my friend as it was too much for me. Khasta paratha was heavenly. The alu gobi as well as the dhaba style daal was so home like. We fell in love with the place. I wish I could go here more often. It's almost 27 km from my place. They have other outlets but I have not been there. This place definitely is one of those for which I would not mind traveling occasionally."

1.0,"RATS in the kitchen..!!!!!!!!!  These people charge for a rat like experience in their dhaba..Kapoors cafe has deteriorated to this extent.. Cant believe..!!I visited this place after about a year..We found a big rat coming out from the kitchen.. when we asked the staff they said there was some maintenance work going on hence the rat is coming out from those areas. Seriously..!! Are we supposed to pay for an experience like that.. we kind of observed for some more time and after noticing another one (could be same) we decided to leave...if you are going there, remember to notice the kitchen.. the most unhygienic kitchen I have seen.. there is litter all around.. I usually dont give a bad review.. I understand food taste going wrong once in a while but a kitchen full of rats..??? I could not finish even half of what I had ordered.."
5.0,It is a paradise for North India food lovers. each and every item which is in the menu is super tasty. Ambiance is not that good but if you are a food lover definitely go for it.
3.0,Too much crowd. Waiting time is also there but its worth it. ordered aloo paratha which is quite large. Lassi is also good. In terms of ambiance and place i will rate 2/5.
4.0,Visited for Dinner. The location is shady. Ambiance is poor. Seating is tight.  Had their famous paranthas and they were yum. Service was fast and the staff was very polite.  If ambiance is not too much of an issue then it's a good place to have quick dinner. Prices are a bit high in my opinion.
1.0,I have rated this place 1 cause zomato doesnt allow me to insult them so badly. What can i say from unhygienic tables to overpriced menu. We just tried their Paneer Lababdar which was awful. They dont serve Tandoor Roti despite being a Punjabi restaurant. Avoid going here. Lassi was good though.
1.0,Overpriced and overrated restro with poor ambience and poor food quality. Only sweet lassi is good. Unhygienic and poor staff service. Don't opt this restro. I think their zomato reviews are paid that's why they are 4 star rated but in reality they are overrated.
4.0,"With some exceptional reviews about this palce .. I landed with one of my friend!! With normal sitting arrangement & Bollywood music.. I felt the place was good..   But but but I didn't tried there Alloo parathe n lassi.. as other reviews say..  I went for other options.. cheese ball, paneer pasanda and phulka roti.. taste wise everything was yum.. little extra spicy for me although   Food wise 5/5 Service 3.5/5 (may be our order was different which one or two in a big crowd do .. it took so much time ) Ambience 3.5/5  This place is more of a dhaba place in Bangalore.. easy clothing ... Relax mood n cheap food"
4.5,If you are vegetarian this place is for you. The starters are different and I like how they have twisted some with Punjabi touch in it. The lassi is amazing and I love the parathas here!
5.0,"THE BEST!!!  Purely vegetarian and is hygienic as well All 3 qualities present in food:: budget-friendly, good quantity and best quality!  The servers, service and upbeat punjabi music keeps your spirits high and leaves you in best mood.  Ordered aloo jeera, dhabe ki dal, missi roti, phulka and LASSI"
4.0,"** must try place **  This was in my wish list for many days,I heard lot about kapoor's cafe from many of friends . Finally it happened to visit this place with my friend who is fan of the cafe. The Ambience is not so great here, it has a  traditional Dhaba look.   Without wasting much time we ordered for punjabi special French fries, Aloo pyaz paratha and Dry fruit lassi. Paratha was served with butter and green chatni and taste was amazing. French fries was different and I liked it very much. Dry fruit was very nice.  Overall it waz a great experience for me, I think the cafe management can think of improving the ambience and cleanliness.  Food:4/5 Service:3.5/5 Ambience:2/5 Value for money:4/5"
3.5,"Probably, Zomato should introduce few categories to rate the restaurants... Like Ambience, Hygiene, Staff Behaviour, Cost, Food Quality, Taste. So we can give ratings for each category and overall rating is weighted average.   Anyways, coming to Kapoor's cafe, the food quality and taste is good but I think it is declining. I have tasted their food for last few years and recently also... I think it's declining.  Ambience is ok but I feel they are bit expensive considering the location and ambience..."
3.0,"Descent food, surely not authentic punjabi taste. Seating and hygiene could be better. Owner is friendly and helpful in case you have any concerns or problem with the food. I'll say try paraths here :)"
4.5,"For Punjabis craving their ghee & butter! Tucked away in a lane, its hidden from the main road. Ambience: Dhaba cum cafe style with Punjabi quotes & fun facts all over the walls:) Food is just yum. Wow. Liked the whole concept of customising posters and Keep Calm quotes for Punjabis with some foot tapping Bhangra Beats!"
3.0,It's a very congested place. If you are out with friends then it's ok but if with family suggest find someplace else.  Also they don't have reservation facility so people have to wait for long duration.  It's not value for money.
4.0,My favorite Punjabi Dhaba in Bangalore. Always liked the service as much as the food. Level of spice is near perfect.  Ambience can get slightly better .
5.0,"It is very difficult to impress a Non Veg aficionado when he pays a visit to a Veg Restaurant. But the tides turned when this restaurant offered its parathas, meals and subzis. Parathas included Aloo and Paneer. Special meals and subzis included a Mushroom gravy and Paneer bhurji. All were delightful and extremely tasty.  Highly recommend."
4.0,"I never knew that I could have such tasty punjabi food in South India. We had ordered Punjabi Dal Thali, Aloo Paratha, Dry Fruit Lassi.  Pros: 1. Taste 4.5/5 (everything except aloo jeera tasted awesome!) 2. Quality of food 4/5 (rotis and dal were equivalent to that of home made food) 3. Value for money 4/5 (per person around 150~200)  Cons: 1. Cleanliness 2/5 (need to keep the place clean - especially kitchen and wash areas) 2. Service 3/5 (slow service and we had to call 2-3 times to place the order) 3. Staff needs to be more friendly and warm toward customers IMO  Deserves a 4/5 - try aloo paratha and punjabi dal. If u want budget friendly and delicious punjabi food - this is ur place.  P.S. If you go in a larger group, it would be more light on your pocket."
1.0,After a friends recommendation visited the place. The ambience was not that great. It is in a narrow shady lane next to a sports arena.Now coming to the food. The food is overhyped. They only add a chunk of butter beneath which the paratha id over cooked with bare minimum amount of filling. They charge extra for curd with paratha (Majorly all authentic Punjabi restaurants serve the curd as a complementary dish with parathas). The only plus point of the dinner was the lassi but they served in a tiny glass.   This place is highly overpriced and there are better authentic Punjab restaurants in Bangalore like Bhatinda junction and Chulha chauki da dhaba.
4.5,"I have been to this place many a times, but last saturday(10th Feb, 2018) was special coz I took my parents to Kapoor's Cafe. Ok now, let me share my thoughts about this place.  1. Zabardast Punjabi music. Just love your collection. 2. Definitely go for the Punjabi french fries. Damn, the pudina over the fries just take the flavor to another level. 3. The Sweet lassi was good, though I felt its more of sweet curd and less of a proper punjabi lassi. 4. We ordered the paneer paraatha, gobi paraatha and aloo pyaaz paraatha. Personally i love the aloo pyaaz paraatha. The filling is adequate with balanced spice content.  Amazing food, amazing music, little over-crowded, little over-priced, wonderful service.  Cheers Team Kapoor's Cafe.."
4.0,"Aloo pyaaz paratha with dollops of awesome butter....lip smacking. With the previous reviews on dry fruit lassi,would say was bit of a let down. Gobi paratha, could have a little more Gobi. All in all stick to the basics and u won't be disappointed."
4.0,"This restaurant was in my list from a long time and had heard a lot of this place for it's authentic Punjabi food and I didn't heard anything wrong... Really enjoyed the Punjabi food here and ate with my hearts out.  Located near to Kundanhalli gate and Gurukul sports complex have a dhaba look with 20-30 seating arrangement are made. The staff were polite and service is quite fast.  We ordered chole kulcha combo, panneer roti combo,panneer dopiaza and one lassi. The combo's we're superb with soft kulcha and chole with nice alu fry and bondi raita. The paneer combo was also nice with good panneer gravy and hot roti's. The panneer dopiaza was full of flavours and with good quantity of onions and panneer.  The lassi was thick and sweet and you have to take the help of a spoon to complete that and also you can treat yourself with a patiala glass of sweet lassi or butter milk.  You have to reach this place a bit early otherwise finding a table will be difficult as there is first come first serve process followed here.  Always recommended...."
3.5,Worth your weekend outing with your freinds. Really liked the ambience which was based on punjab style. Service was good. Ordered paratha . Best place to have parathas.
2.0,"A bit overpriced, used to be half in price one year back. Even though taste is good, prices doesn't fit with the present ambience. Not worth it anymore."
2.5,Not sure why people rate this place so high. Food is so oily and the place was quite unhygienic. Lassi was good though. One might want to go there for the Dhaba feel although its not even quite a Dhaba.
4.0,"I heard a lot about this place from my friends who stays near kundanhalli. So it was in my bucket list from long time and finally visited this place in first week of December.  Ambience : It is not like classy restaurants. It is with a village type dhaba look which you see in villages. Closed and crowded area with chair tables. So ambience was not impressive according to the cost.  Food : I ordered 'Sarson Da Saag Combo' which contains Sarso Da Saag, 2 Makke De Paranthay, Boondi Raita, White Makkah & Gur  Food was really good in taste according to Punjabi food restaurants in Bengaluru. Don't compare with real Punjab...It is not good as we get in real Punjab.  Service: Service was not slow and not so quick too.  Price : It costed me approx 450. Which is quite high according to ambience.  Overall experience was good."
5.0,"Now this place is a vegetarians paradise .. it tops my list of restaurants where u get clean yummy vegetarian food . Apart from the regular dishes on the menu which are totally lip smacking,u should first go for the parathas or paratha combos .which is. totally to die for ! N top it up with their Amazing lassi. The location of the place is a lil unexpected but that's what adds essence to this entire casual dining experience. Lovely owners, super polite ever smiling staff .. I don't think I know of a single person who gt disappointed by the food or anything there .so therefore I go there at least one once a month or once every alternate month. Happy eating :)"
1.0,This place no longer the charm it had a year back. I ordered for chole bathure - which was clearly a mistake. The restaurant was very dirty and looked unhygienic. Go at your own risk.
4.0,"If you want a place for good desi Dhaba style food especially morning parathas with butter and dahi (Curd) then this is the apt chain to visit.  The best and my personal favourite paratha is cheese stuffed oozing out in every bite. You can visit with friends, family and even fun office lunches are good if its near to your workplace.  I have visited this place every time I am in town after a party night as a hangover cure for my hungry stomach to fill."
4.5,"Nice place for veg peeps..... But too over- rated. Quality and service is no doubt but as per the quantity , rate are high. Punjabi style fries is the unique dish which I have never tried anywhere else in Bangalore....."
4.5,"Wonderful Aloo Paratha, gobhi paratha and chaaz. I deduct half a number because their lassi is too costly like the rest of the menu. Also thoda tell Kam plz"
5.0,"*Vegetarian's Paradise*  In today's time, we rarely see a restaurant with all veg menu being run successfully by only sticking to the basics which is to give VERY GOOD FOOD. Kapoor's Cafe is definitely one of them.  This is by far the most Punjabi restaurant I've been to. I mean, from the place, wall hanging(in which there's reason to various stereotypes on why Punjabis are loud, happy types etc which also is a fun read) , ambiance, music it's all Punjabi.  First thing, if you are looking to have a quiet meal or social gathering over food, then this is not the place for you. The tables are kept so close to one another that you'll literally feel you've come to a langar.  Coming to the food... Let me start with what we ordered: 1. Aloo Pyaaz Paratha ~ oh boy, this was the best item that we ordered! Green chilies inside it gave spiciness to it.  2. Cheese Paratha ~ I'm not a big fan of adding cheese to all possible food items, but it was good. But I'll suggest to order gobhi or mix Paratha instead. All the parathas were loaded with stuffing and were served with a gigantic slice of butter on top (perfect for a skinny guy like me ) and a bowl of green chutney.  3. Dal ~ Spectacular. It was a bit spicy but that added to its taste. The Dal got its richness from the butter and cream used in it.  4. Dry fruit Lassi Patiala Glass ~ Refreshing & Delicious with lots of dry fruit and a touch of saffron (kesar) in it. It's very thick and heavy.  Besides the items mentioned above, one can give Chole bhature, pindi chole a try (both looked very tempting). I really appreciate places like this which make visitors experience memorable by simply focusing on the food. Thank you for the wonderful experience.  P.S. :- Do not miss out on their aachaar. It's fab."
3.0,"The cafe is a typical spot for punjabi food cravings, the aloo paratha is a big one loaded with lots of butter.The chole bhature and kulche are also good in taste the lassi is worth having.All in all its an average spot for your north indian food cravings"
4.0,"From a long time I wanted to go to this place. Being saturday, my friend would eat veg food only! So decided to explore this place!   The restaurant is a mixture of dhaba and normal restaurant. It was so crowded in the afternoon but luckily we got a table. Caution: this place is very very generous with butter so if you are not in the mood for increasing your cholesterol , please let them know while ordering.   We ordered the below items:  1. Sarson da saag combo thali - 4/5 makki ki roti was quite good. Sarson da saag had a dolop of white butter and it was a pure pleasure!  It was prepared quite well!   2. Chilli Onion khasta paratha - 3.5/5 nothing special with regards to taste. It was okay They prepare all parathas in wheat flour so that was a plus point for us!  3. Lassi - 4.2/5 I love having lassi in kulhad. The quantity was quite good but in the end wasn't able to finish it They added saffron too in the lassi which enhanced the flavor.   Overall, my rating would be 3.9/5 for food. For ambiance, I wouldn't prefer giving rating. It is a small, packed restaurant cum dhaba. Wouldn't mind visiting this place again!"
1.0,"After hearing a lot about this place, we finally placed an online order today.  Food arrived after an hour and it was very cold. We waited long and hoped that atleast the wait will be worth but it wasn't. Oil was floating in the curry, cheese pakodas were oversalty and cold, to the extent that cheese inside had turned hard. Paratha was cold too. I don't understand if the food was ready earlier why did it take so long to deliver. Never ordering from here again."
4.5,"Amazing food and good serving size. Really tasty food and value for money   The ambience is very average but a place like this u go to enjoy authentic punjabi food . V tried makki ki roti with saag, aaloo parantha, kobi parantha and lasi: all were awesome   Tip : go there on a Sunday afternoon after skipping ur breakfast and u wudnt need to have dinner"
3.5,"Authentic North Indian punjabi food. I went there with one of my Sardar friend, and boy oh boy, the waiting list was huge. People were literally waiting outside with their waiting list number chit. We did the same and entered in 30 mins.   Ambience okayish type, if u want good ambience, this is not the place. This place is loud. Its exactly like some Dhaba in north India, but it is designed in this way to give the proper ambience. In food we ordered paneer butter masala along with tandoori roti and lassi. Quantity wise lassi came in very small glass, and it costed us 50/-. It was good so we ended up ordering one more. Food taste was good but nothing to die for. VFM- not so much as its costly and quantity is less.   Will I go again? Probably but only to taste items like saag, paratha with white mukhan"
4.0,Went for a weekend Lunch with friends all from Delhi   Food-Good loved lots of butter over sarson da saag Drinks- NA Ambience - Good (reminded of college canteen) Service- Quick and Good Price- Pocket Friendly
1.5,This place is not at all recommended if you are planning for a party with couple of friends. The ambiance of the place is worst. How can you focus on your food when you sweat. you feel like suffocated when you enter the place. Also the food they serve is extreme spicy and masala in it. Not good for health. Also the price is exorbitant if you compare with the quality of food and ambiance.
3.0,"Had heard so much about this place, that this was kinda the best paratha place in bangalore n all. Overall a very mediocre experience.  Did not anyways have much expectations about ambience and cleanliness.  Food was mediocre at best.  Lassi was very very sweet. Finishing small glass of lassi became a big task. Raita was horrible. Matlab how can boondi raita be the worst dish served on a table. Parathas were just average, filling wasnt great, not cooked properly. A full scoop of almost 100ml butter over parathas to maybe supress the taste (or lack of it). Chutney accompanying the parathas was watery.  No intentions of going back again."
5.0,Best place for vegetarians food. Overall experience was really good. Went there couple of times as well as ordered food from here online also
4.5,"This is one of my fav places near office probably. Such yum food really. Except that the place is a little stuffy and hot, everything else is perfect. A great place with really friendly service. Worth the price. Love this place, would definitely visit again! :)"
4.5,People should visit this place if you want to enjoy typical punjabi food. The parathas are awesome. For first timers order one paratha and try finishing it first. Lassi is very good here. I am giving 4.5 for food only. People can compromise on ambience if food is really good
3.0,"It's situated a little remotely and hence the surrounding area is a little dingy. But once you enter inside the place is nice. We went on a Friday afternoon and the place had a buzzing crowd. The service is nice and the food is good too. We tried out the cheese burst parathas which were really good. If you are exclusively veg then I would recommended this place but otherwise compared to all that Bangalore has to offer , I don't think this places lives up to the high standards"
5.0,"This place doesn't seize to amuse! The paranthas are definitely what brings me here every time! You must try this place if you love paranthas. That said, their pakoras, lassi, chaas are all lovable. Warning: The parantha's are huge and very filling. So if you're not really the big-eating types, watch what you're ordering!"
4.0,"Want to try authentic North Indian food.Well we got one lovely place here.You won't get non veg here.But if you want to try veg then this is the place for you. Right from the time you enter you hear the Punjabi songs streaming into your ears.One feels like standing up and dancing to the tunes at his own place.Such is the demand of this  place that you have to wait to get inside in weekends.Once you get in you feel like a classic feel of North India. Coming to the food,what to say!!You get parathas that is topped with a big spoon of butter.Butter melting on the hot parathas is a treat to the eye.You can't resist attacking the paratha.Kullad wali lassi is heavy indeed.I was able to drink only small cup.Right from sarso ka sag to makki ki roti to dal makhani you get everything. Atmosphere and the guys out there are pretty awesome as well.Dressed in classic Punjabi attire they give you the feeling that you are in Punjab. Only concern is that it's overpriced but who cares about the price when you are getting such good authentic North Indian food. Lovely being here.Will definitely visit next time if I get a chance.Visit here if you love Punjabi food. :)"
1.0,"The most unprofessional restaurant ever. Order only if you are okay with the food arriving more than an hour late. I dont know about the other branches but whitefield branch's food is dissappointing. They call it authentic punjabi , should visit punjab first."
4.5,This place never leaves any food lover with disappointment with respect to taste. I would like to recommend this place to people around Whitefield for a good meal.
4.0,"Wow this place was a surprise package. Went in and the location is like inside a grudgy little sports academy. I couldn't understand from the looks of it why it was so famous. You can easily miss it if you aren't aware. But the moment i stepped in i realised why this place is what it is. It is very very difficult to find a dhaba anywhere near bangalore and even more difficult to find authentic punjabi cusine serving restaurants. This place ticks all the points of the perfect dhaba. The look and feel is there. The ambiance is there. The food is just amazing. It is an only veg restaurant. But each dish is marvelous. Not at all oily. Beautiful, authentic taste. Served is hugeeee quantity. Oh god. Never order something all by yourself, you won't be able to finish it. Service is great! Music is pure punjabi remixes. Price is really good for all that they serve. Loved it, will visit it again anytime i want to eat dhaba type food but are actually top quality restaurants food."
5.0,"A group of 12 of us went here on Friday for lunch and it was crowded. We waited for around 20 minutes and they arranged the table for 12 of us and ordered a lot of items. Service was very prompt and quick. This place has a dhaba vibes with Punjabi music playing in the background.  We ordered almost all kinds of paranthas which was served with a generous dollop of butter.We also ordered chole bhature. I would say this is the best chole bhature I 've ever had . We tried main Course also In main Course we ordered paneer do pyaaza, mushroom masala,kadai paneer,Dal Makhni ,pindi chole and sarso da saag with makkhan. All items were delicious in taste We also had a lot of lassis and the fruit lassi is the best one.  We had a great time at Kapoor's cafe Great food and great service"
4.0,"Bad parts first: cutlery is not clean, kitchen looks a bit dingy and place is actally a shed - ambiance scores low. Good parts: staff is courteous, service is not slow and I am told the prices are comparable to others in the area Best parts: portions are big and food is yummy to the most part. Pindi chana and khasta kulcha were the stars"
4.5,"Food - 5/5 - No doubt in that :) Ambiance & Decor - 2.5/5 Service - 4.5/5  Kapoors Cafe - One of the best place to have authentic Punjabi food. The ""Parathas"" , they are really really awesome ; loaded with butter & the Taste - its lip smacking (Give cheese burst paratha a try) . I have been there numerous times and have ordered also online & was not disappointed a single time . Other than Parathas , a Palak Paneer ; Pindi Chole ; Lassi are a must try here ."
4.5,"This place made me fall for vegetarian food. The food is awesome. It has been almost 3-4 times that I made a visit and each time left highly contended. The cheese pakora, paneer pakora, panner paratha (with loads of butter), dhabe ki dal and special mention to Lassi... these were few of my loved dishes. A must visit for food lovers."
4.0,"Kapoors Cafe has been very overwhelmingly popular shortly after they opened.  There was a lot of noise around how expensive their menu was, how their food is not very original.  But I have been a fan of their food from day 1, since I tried.  I do agree with the expensive part, but its good quality vegetarian food.  I have always been a big fan of their lassi, which is loaded with such goodness that I feel energised whenever I feed in this pot of white gold.  Their Tandoori rotis, Paneer Butter Masala has been mine & my familys favourite + staple.  However when I recently tried the Dal Makhani & Kadai Paneer Combo (off course paired with a lassi), I have found my new favourites.  The Dal was spectacular with Rice & Roti, took me to some of the best places I have had Dal in & around Delhi.  The Kadai Paneer was superbly spicy to my liking, & loved every bite of it.  The only downside was the rotis which were extremely dry & a little stale.  It really did not do any justice to the wonderful Dal & Paneer Accompaniments.  Overall a great place for wonderful vegetarian Punjabi Food.  Never, Ever, miss the Matka Lassi."
4.0,"Kapoor's cafe is the first choice when I wish to have some good stuffed parathas and Indian vegetarian food in Whitefield. A small dhaba place near Gurukul sports on Varthur road this place always has upbeat Punjabi tracks playing which livens up the place. Have been here and ordered from here countless times and the food quantity and quality is really good.  My all time favorite is Cheese and Aloo pyaaz paratha. All the parathas are topped with a huge dollop of butter and are lip smacking good and satiating. It's difficult not to take a nap after this heavy dose of parathas. Apart from these Malai kofta, chole bhature, paneer degchiwale, pindi chole, daal and lassi are again very good picks. Almost everything I've tried so far has been great so pretty much assured you wouldn't be leaving disappointed. They do have Desi fusion wraps and all their Indian breads are made of whole wheat. Starters like pakoras and Punjabi fries are average. After all the food you could try saving some space for shahi tukda which is a sweet bread pudding item to end on a sweet note. Service is quick, delivery partnership with both Swiggy and Zomato. Only thing is I find this place slightly overpriced especially for the wraps."
4.0,Awesome food & more awesome service! Even after being so crowded they don't mix up the orders & serve with a smile on their faces & 100gms butter on each plate. :)
4.5,"If you order online, your experience maybe totally different. I'll write here about dine-in experience. I've been to Kapoor's numerous times. Although there are many items on the menu, we've ordered paranthas always.  Paranthas are served with huge load of butter. Paranthas are the best, I've tasted in bangalore. Also, masala coke is a breeze."
4.0,"A great place if you are a die hard punjabi food lover. Everytime I visit this place I decide not to overeat and end up doing that. The food taste is awesome. The only problem is the food price has gone on to be on the pricier side with time the cafe has grown and the other problem is they don't serve tandori roti which is a must for any punjabi food place. Otherwise the chole bhature,paneer pakoda ,Cheese paratha, pudeena paratha,Dal makhani,lassi all the combos taste really great."
3.0,"I heard people saying that this is the best outlet for punjabi food. However, being a punjabi, what i felt was that I might have liked the food but didn't love it.   Price wise it's cheaper compared to other restaurants. But food wise, I would give 3 rating to it."
4.5,"Authentic Punjabi food with an ambience filled with Punjabi references.   Ambience - Very busy and crowded especially on weekends. A small outlet with non stop Punjabi music and walls filled with cute Punjabi one-liners and jokes.   Service - Service takes a while due to the nature of the food served here. But the Punjabi music will keep you occupied. Waiters are friendly.   Food - Best Punjabi food I have had in South India. Ample makkan (butter) on your parathas, thick lassis and spicy curries will make you go bonkers. For starters we had masala pappad and cheese balls, both of which were spicy but yum. We ordered two combos - the kadai paneer and the Chana one. When they say it's spicy, it is beyond imaginably spicy so don't ignorantly say okay to that if you can't stand spice. Quantity was fabulous and we licked our plates clean. The mango lassi came in a mud matka (pot) and tasted divine that we ordered 3 more.   Cost - Economical for the quality and quality you get.   Would live here if I could just to eat from here everyday."
5.0,The food and dessert was great.. Things to try are the parathas and sarso da saag. All the breads were good. Very friendly staff and service was also fast here.
4.0,"We visited Kapoors Caf near Thubarahalli and really enjoyed the authentic Punjabi food. Barring the fact that despite so many posters that state the importance of chicken in their cuisine they are a vegetarian restaurant, the food is extremely good.  Definitely enjoyable and authentic.  Moving on to the other stuff that matter as well:  Price  worth it.  Location  not as easy to locate, but there is parking so thats a plus.    Ambience  not the best, more function than flash.  Service  have been there only once and its decent.  Value for money  definitely yes, especially with the portions.   On the whole, a good option to try for north Indian food."
4.5,"Had sarso saag combo, enjoyed it. Came with big dallo of white butter, which was yummy. Quantity is more that enough for 2 people. Chaas was also good. Service was usual was prompt."
1.5,Very unhygienic. There is a garbage dump inside the premises. Overpriced. Just does not justified by the food quality and taste. Not at all punjabi food  Dissapointing
2.5,Less than average. We recently had food at Kapor's cafe.We ordered for chole bhature and chole puri.The gravy was full of tomatoes.Chole were not at all boiled.Anyone who belongs from North would definitely not like this place.Will never go there again
3.0,The food was a bit too oily for my taste. The place has a tin roof so gets quite warm during summers.  Overall my experience at the restaurant was okay-ish
4.5,A must visit for North Indian cuisines. lots of varieties and very reasonable. Kullahad lassi is to die for. Loved the food and would suggest everyone to try.
4.0,"Of all the preparations i have tried here, i love lassi the most. That kesar tinge is very appealing (at least to me). I mostly have had parathas here; gobi and paneer being my favorite. I love the tarka daal as well; reminds me of my grandmom's cooking. The ambiance is mediocre, but i like the see through oven/chula touch. The staff is very friendly since it mostly comprises of the father and the sons running the business. I just wish it wasn't all veg, a kickass butter chicken recipe would take the rating all the way up to 5 ."
1.5,VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Ok..so this restaurant used to be my fav since last 2 years.. But i have seen the quality of food and other services have gone down immensely..  Food.. Extremely spicy..full of red chilli powder and other spices..roti aur phulka was not at all like phulka.. Half burnt..half cooked ..full of flour on it..we are indians dont we know how to make a simple roti.. It was not Punjabi food but just for the sake of taste they added a lot lot lottt of spices..hard to eat food.  Packaging (since i ordered through an app) Worst packaging ever..just one tape to cover the lid of the curry..so finally it stained my clothes and bedsheet..  Very very disappointed! You lost a customer today..
3.5,"Moderate crowd  Pure Vegetarian   Parking Facility: Yes Food Cost: 4/5 Food Taste: 3.5/5 Food Quantity: 4.5/5 Food Type: Punjabi  Personal Fav: cheese pathaka balls, lassi.  Seating Arrangements: 3/5 Coupons: Nope Cleanliness: 3.5/5 Spot for photos: 2/5 Staff: 4/5 View: 2/5  P.S. one paratha will be enough for 2 of them. Big and filling."
4.0,"The true essence of Punjab.  But only vegetarian essence. Loved the food, the songs, the wall. Loved this place. Be it sarso da saag, makke di roti, kulche, pindi masala, lassi, everything tasted so pure. A bit congested but that can be ignored."
5.0,Awesome North Indian food...all time favourite .  Most Go to restraunt and amazing food every time...speaciality are parathas......................
4.5,"Best punjabi parathe this side of dilli. Malai kofta was  authentic too. The aloo in paratha didn't taste good, and the chaach was not not prepared fresh."
4.0,"An absolute delight! If you want to go for authentic punjabi food; if you're from the north and you crave ghar ka swad; if you have a one single gene from Punjab and you are in bangalore feeling homesick: Dont think. JUST GO!!! I went for a Saturday lunch and it was packed. The lassi was  the best I had in months. We got phulkas, jeera rice, dhabe ki dal and PBM! Review: Emotional, good, brilliant, yummy!! The service is good and relatively not slow. The ambience gets full mark. It's not just a one time go for sure.  PS: They make their own white butter which you must try"
5.0,Amazing Food.. Dil se punjabi food! Must eats are paratha lassi and pakoras. Wish I would have known about this place before. Good service and beautiful ambience
5.0,"No doubt, the best. Eat it to feel it! The food tastes as Punjabi as it could get. Missi roti, Shahi paneer, naan, chola sabji is what I've tried till now."
4.0,Within a week had been twice to this restaurant.. and same company... This in itself talks about the cafe... Just loved everything about its offerings. The parathas are too heavy to be finsihed by one person... Too yummy... The food quantity is sufficient and the breads are served hot !  We tried Patiala lassi... It was very sweet ..  Very pocket friendly.
4.5,"Its a very cute, small and simple cafe. Loved it as soon as I entered the cafe. Food tastes delicious. Must try would be butter phulka and dry fruit lassi.  Service could be improved little bit."
5.0,Great place and great food. Size is good. Try it with sweet lassi. The butter quantity is great. Perfect place to have parathas. The best parathas in Bangalore... Loved it...
4.0,Food is good in taste. But it is not value for money. Try Aloo paratha. Its good. Service and staff are good. Good for GR employees as very few options are available here.
1.0,Pathetic food. Very greasy. No taste. We ordered Cholle combo and Saag combo. Both the dishes had no taste. You can get better Cholle anywhere. Makki ki roti was too thick. The place was very unhygienic and the price was too costly for the quality and quantity of food.
4.5,"For a Punjabi like me, Kapoor cafe is home!  The food is delicious, the service is quick and what the hell, it's Punjabi food, it has to be good!  From generous amounts of butter on parathas to super yummy lassi, KC steals our heart away. I love their aloo, Gobi, paneer parathas. Totally love their Rajma and aloo jeera. Punjabi fries are okayish.  Shahi tukda is yummy.  My favourite's gotta be aloo pyaaz paratha with white butter. I cry each time I eat that. Total value for money. And well you can't eat too much so the bill never burns a hole our pockets.  I rest my case."
3.0,"I feel this is a slightly overrated place in terms of quality of food.. heard it used to be great and value for money. While I agree on the latter, the quality is a little let down for me. Parathas are good and decent combos. Had gone for dine-in as well  as delivery  on occasions. The last delivery wasn't particularly on expected lines, what I got was chilly hot parathas which felt like ordered from some Andhra place and not a Punjabi one for sure...... Guess they've outgrown their reputation."
4.5,"Parantha and lassi, the best available. A little bit on the spicy side along with the strong Chaas. Overall great food. Ambience is alright but hard to find"
3.5,Makke de Roti..sarao ka saag....in winters was fun..its was ok...but cannot beat the actual taste of noth wala sarso da saag....lassi was quite good.... ambience is not something to attract customers...
4.0,"Nice place... courteous staff...the cheese patakha balls are nice ...a little spicy, cheesy obviously when paired with the green chutney taste really good... The buttermilk is also very good Sarso da sag and makke di roti combo is a real delight for ur taste buds... If there are 2 people having supper I would suggest to go for the combos..."
3.5,"We find the taste here just ok. We order chola bhatura. Bhatura was ok. Chole, we had better choles at other places. Also we ordered Kachori aloo. We foud Kachori very thik."
4.5,"One of the best and reasonable Punjabi restaurant in Bangalore. Lassi is a must try. Parathas are awesome and also the pakodas. Weekend are crowded, try weekday evenings for best quality food"
4.5,"Unexpectedly in Bengaluru, there's a joint that serves you similar food as any Murthal Dhaba. As if that was not enough, they serve you the same white makhkhan & gur if you order Sarson da Saag - Makke di Roti. Went there on 13/11 alongwith my wife and in addition to above, we also ordered Dal Makhani combo and Kheer. Would give food 4.5 on 5, just because Dal Makhani had a minor excess of cinammon & cardamom that was over powering and we shared this with the Incharge - an Oriya fellow who justified stating that Mon is a weekly off for the main Chef. Kheer was not good. Location again quite average and ironically 20mtrs inside of the main road. We could still not spot the place. But what a good joint for all who like dhaba like setting & north-Indian food."
3.0,"Great place for parathas. The parathas here are larger, spicier and ofcourse tastier than the ones you find in most of the other places in Bangalore. My favorites are the lassis both the regular and dry fruit. The Punjabi French fries is also different and unique. Reservation is preferred if available, else you will spend time waiting as there are not many tables and the place always gets full. It is always better to let the waiter know if you want to go easy on the butter on parathas. The owner who sits at the bill counter is very cordial and always seeks feedback. If the management is reading this, I will request them to resume online orders through Zomato, to BEML layout which is the nearest residential area for this restaurant. Bizarre that they stopped . And the prices have become a tad expensive recently."
5.0,"A perfect place for me when I crave for North Indian food. Punjabi style french fries are my favourite. Forget dieting when you are here. After all it's Punjabi food. Butter on those huge and perfectly stuffed parathas are just what you want. Tried cheese parantha here for the first time and loved it. Best dal makhni I have eaten in Bangalore so far. Chhole bhature are a blessing. Phule huye phulke will remind you of home. Lassi, buttermilk, masala cold drink..any beverage you order, you won't be disappointed."
3.0,"Nice decent punjabi taste. U get the feel of northindian food.  Ambience-4 Staff-4.5 Taste-3 Must try- Aloo paratha, sarso ka saag, white butter, Laasi"
4.0,Proper veg Punjabi restaurant. If you r craving for some real alloo parathas or sarda da saag makke di roti must visi this plase coz this place gives you a proper punjabi food. They also provide white butter along with parathas. Ambience is kind of ok and staff management is also ok
4.0,"A vegetarian Punjabi food joint is rather rare. But even rarer is a Veg one with mouth-watering dishes. We were not expecting it to be a vegetarian joint but once management proudly assured that we will forget non-veg if we eat here makes us curious to try. The restaurant has mixed points in both ways. The building is a tiny one with thatched roof but cleanliness and hygiene is well maintained. The ambience was like a typically Punjabi dhaba with loud music and witty Punjabi comments but lacks Air conditioning. The aroma is super with scent of melting butter /ghee all around but the chairs could be more comfortable. The food here is really good with typical Punjabi flavor and spices. We ordered one of the combo thalis which they have alongwith Chole Pindi, Alu paratha and butter Naan. We finish our food journey here with Patiala dry fruit Lassi. The parathas were mind boggling and the Shahi Paneer was also equally good. Chole Pindi was liked by my husband only but I can assure that you will not dislike any food here. The icing on the top was various Lassis they have. The Patiala glass was really large and we enjoyed it thoroughly. The waiters were really polite and the serving is really quick despite Sunday crowd. Overall a rating of 4.0 from my side. One more point before I forget - the price is not very down to earth as mentioned by some reviewers but the food is really tasty to compensate for that.                                           ...Read full post on baisalichef.blogspot.com"
4.5,"Love the enthusiastic and friendly management who look forward to your feedback in the most polite tone no matter how busy they are! The food is awesome, loaded with spices and oil/ghee/butter. Gives you the real Punjabi feel. The place is rustic and looks like a tiny dhaba, but hygiene seems fine and the service is really consistent considering how busy they always are. Can work a bit on the cleanliness"
4.0,"At the outset it has very downtown look, but once you eat the food you will feel like heaven.. all its food are authentic, courteous staff and very quick to serve...Price is also I found value for money.. I ordered veg masala, kofta and papad. But the ultimate winner is phulka.. Don't miss this veg hotel when in need of genuine Punjabi style food, you will definitely love it."
4.0,"The food at this place got me doing some Balle, balle! Hahah!  The ambiance is that of a typical Punjabi dhaba with it's thatched roof, loud music and Punjabi sayings. From the time we entered the cafe, I could smell the tantalizing aroma of freshly made butter that got me terribly hungry.  The matka chaas was a total delight as it was so very very fresh. For appetizers, we ordered French Fries Punjabi Style that was generously loaded with green chillies, mirch powder and accompanied with a spicy green chutney. If you love spice, this is a must try.  But of course, the show stealer was the paranthas. Oh boy, were they good or what! We ordered the Mix Parantha, Aloo Parantha, Onion Parantha and Paneer Parantha, all of which were wonderfully hot, loaded with stuffing and served with a gigantic blob of butter on top. The Mix Parantha was my favourite. Along with the fresh butter of course!  Leave aside the ambiance and everything else, go here to have some really delicious, authentic Punjabi style paranthas and butter. I am surely going back, obviously!"
1.5,"Heard a lot about this place from but was utterly disappointed. Ambience is not great.  Ordered ""Dhabe Ki Dal"",Veg Kolhapuri,Phulkas & Khasta Paratha. Plates used for serving were quite old, which had very small holes in them. Dal & Veg Kolhapuri were quite good. However Phulkas served along with them were too cold."
4.5,"Best place I have recently visited in the Bangalore. It has lot to offer, starting with spicy starters to mouth watering curries, food here will take your taste buds to heaven. At the end one glass of sweet lassi will give you another reason to visit this place. Keep the quality of service as it is, since it is rarely seen in restaurants in Banglore."
4.0,"It used to be one of the favorites in earlier days when there were few good restaurants that provided quality veg food items and dishes . The taste of the food is really awesome , be it parantha or curry or dal. The food really has authentic north Indian taste here. Lassi and kheer is its speciality."
1.0,Hugely disappointing food...found overpriced to the quality delivered...need to work on quality..and more value for money delivery expected ....
3.5,Food was ok and the rates are definitely not consistent with the food quality and ambience of the restaurant. Highly overpriced and overrated.
4.0,"A perfect place for people who want to have great north indian food (especially Parathas, Lassi and Desi ghee rice). One of the best amongst all the places I visited in terms of food. However, the ambiance is okaish. Do expect much from it. It might be a little sweaty if you plan to go for a lunch. But still the food is soooo amazing that you will forget everything. A must...must.. try for all the real foodies out there. Not to forget,, they are super friendly for your pockets ;)."
3.5,Ordered 1)Dry fruit lassi 2)Masala soda  3)Chaas 4)Masala papad 5)Cheese Pataka Balls 6)Kalmi Punjabi Sticks 7)Dal makhni combo 8)Cheese paratha   Food quality- 4/5 Hospitality- 3.5/5 Service- 4/5 Management response- 3.5/5 Value for money- 3.5/5
3.0,"It used to be the go to place for authentic North Indian food cravings but the recent visit has been much of a disappointment. The place is way too over rated. The soaring food prices don't do justice with one's taste buds. I was with my friends and we decided it to be kapoors cafe for dinner that night, since it was in our vicinity. We ordered cheese, panner and aloo pyaaz parantha. The more of veggies and comparatively lesser amount of cheese belittled the name of the dish 'CHEESE Parantha' . Panner stuffed in the panner paratha ignited a small tussle between my teeth and the rubbery paneer. Aloo pyaaz parantha followed by Lassi became our savior for that night. I would strongly recommend them to work on improving their ambience. They also need to increase the staff count. The restaurant is unkempt especially the restroom area. They should also consider expanding the area. The place is too congested."
4.5,"Authentic Punjabi food . Punjabi's near this area should definitely visit this place. It's a nice warm place to go and eat with your family and friends . Taste will remind you of the food from the streets of Punjab and Delhi . One thing that they could change is the prices , it's a bit over priced .But the food is delicious."
5.0,One of the best punjabi food and snacks I have ever eaten! The authentic taste of ghee and chillies in punjabi foods along with the dhaba style preparation makes it altogether heavenly. The preparation time os also less. The lassi and paranthe are definitely worth trying :)
1.0,"This restaurant is known for his traditional north indian taste. I have been there 2-3 times but to be frank I didn't like their food much. I have tasted shahi paneer, few more paneer gravies,  chole kulche, aalo parantha, masala papad, gobi masala(not cooked well), bhindi fry, baigan ka bhartha, veg pullao along with many other dishes(I don't remember the names) and of course both normal and dry fruit lassi. The quality of food is ok but doesn't have any WOW factor. Gobi masala as I said was extremely bad and tasteless. Wasn't even cooked well. Also they have drastically increased prices which doesn't even go with the quality food and taste they offer. Except their lassi and aloo parantha to some extent I didn't find anything else good here. Paneer gravies have no taste at all. They should reduce the prices and work on improving the taste of their food. I don't know how this restaurant has got a rating of 4. May be north indian guys living near Whitefield don't have much options to taste typical North indian food so thats why they have given this restaurant an average rating of 4 but Frankly it doesn't even deserve 3 rating considering the cost of the food. I don't know on what basis they have increased the prices so much. They don't offer any special ambience. Its a very simple restaurant without any fancy things on which they would have invested a lot of money. Just like a normal 2 star restaurant."
3.5,"Food is good. But too oily and made in such a way that if you eat a little, you feel saturated. Don't know about how healthy because place didn't seem that clean. Parathas are nice"
3.5,"Way to costly as compared to the food they serve. The quantity of food is too less for the price they charge. The roti quality was also not good. The best thing is the place, it gives you a feeling or north indian dhaba. For food no to it at this price but the lassi was yum."
3.5,"No restraunt better than this for a nice shot of Punjabi Food, at first you might find it small, dirty, loud and crowded from the outside, but guys Sabar ka phal meetha hota hai (Check translation on G00gle) Inside you will see the nice Punjabi themed dhaba.  Food  is just amazing, Shahi paneer and Veg Kadai being a must try. Something i found very suprising was the white butter, really fresh and very Punjabi.  The only BIG problem is the loud music and the waiting time.  Be Fat Be Happy"
5.0,Humble staff. Amazing food. Typical North Indian. Loved it. Must visit place for all who crave for North Indian food here in Bangalore. Not so costly.
1.0,"Pathetic food..ordered peas pulav and it was tasteless..full of oil,no salt..it was not even worth 30 RS rice bath what we get in small hotels..utter waste of 260 RS including delivery charges. Got throat infection and stomach upset after eating the Kapoor's cafe's pathetic food"
4.0,"Nice place.... Very crowded but luckily we got the place in 5 min. Service is good, awesome paratha they serve. Gobi paratha is simply awesome. Lassi is just amazing. Fast service, courteous staff. Just work a little on your ambience and staff coordination."
4.0,Service is a bit slow especially because of lack of number of serving staffs in comparison to the number of people that flock to get a delicious Punjabi taste.
5.0,Nice place.... Friendly people and the Food taste was amazing really love it and worth for the money thenks guys for making my day great.....
5.0,"Kapoor's cafe is my survival. It will make you Nostalgic of your North Indian roots. Best past inspite of spicies, butter and ghee running in their vien, they happily accomodated my wish of no chillies in the food! Yum food and you go back tummy full! Plus you have tons of No Onion No Garlic options also. Bookmark the place."
2.5,"Over the past two months, prices of all food items & beverages have skyrocketed by Rs 20. Needless to say, the quantity provided is meagre and is REALLY NOT worth the money spent! I doubt it will satiate even a 5 yr old's hunger. Coming to the quality, I did like the sumptuous delicacies as Pindi choley, Baigan Bharta, Paneer etc. But again, prices are WAY TOO HIGH (afraid to say nearly all restaurants in Whitefield are looting)! Rotis are a bit harder to chew and costs 15 per piece!!! Quantity of Lassi has been reduced and price have been increased to Rs 70 from what earlier was Rs 50. Overall, once an order of Pindi Choley, 4 Phulkas amounted to Rs 265 (including packing charges of Rs 15), now the same order cost total Rs 366 (including delivery charges)!!! Wow. Very soon I woulnt be surprised if the cost at this ordinary restaurant (given the ambience) would hit Rs 1000-1300 for two people."
4.0,"Locating the restaurant - is quite easy.  Parking - They have ample space for both 2 wheelers and 4 wheelers.At peak times, due to haphazard parking of 2 wheelers, the way to 4 wheeler parking gets choked.  What's good - The food - both taste & quality. The restaurant themselves encourage digital payments.  How's food - We were satisfied with both the taste and quality of all the items we tasted. The items marked spicy are moderately spicy. Paneer Degchi Dilliwaale is certainly not for spice lovers. Chilli Khasta Paratha was good.With the a big chunk of butter, Aloo Paratha had to be eaten with guilt. Had fruit cream, dry fruit lassi and lassi. Dry fruit lassi was rich and having it in a matka just makes it a little better.  What is not so impressive Ambience - Very little space between tables, a little noisy and not so greatly maintained wash out area and wash room.  Personally felt pricing was a little high on the dry fruit lassi and fruit cream.  What's different The bill doesn't reach your desk. Rather we walk to the counter and pay the bill after their staff inform our table number.  In order of priority - Food, Service    Bottom Line - Worth a visit."
4.0,"Ordered aloo paratha, rotis, mutter paneer from this place and the parathas were really flavourful. The curry however was overlly spicy and had quite a lot heat to it. Giving it a 4 rating as i feel the menu is more on the pricier side and you dont get that special of a food/packaging/flavours from here as you expect on top of this i paid a hefty 98 tax on a pricy bill. I will not order from here because i feel there are many other restaurants providing this quality at better price. Though i applaud their customer service as they did inform about delay in delivery(just under a 700m away from my home)."
3.5,Whenever I want to have north indian food this is one of the fev place .....main problem is they don't served non veg....food is good music also catchy.....service is ok ....
2.0,"Heard a lot about this place and the food but to be frank the price is quite high as compared to the quantity of food they serve. The rice served was like just for taste purpose, the phulkas were not at all good and alu jeera was also not upto the mark. The only good thing was Raita. Not recommended! Not value for money."
4.0,"Very nice punjabi restaurants it is.. and taste wise it's really awesome... roties, parotas and kulchas superb..one main thing to say is buttermilk and lassi we have to taste... it is very very good ..but it'll be good if they serve non.veg also...."
4.0,had ordered aloo pyaaz parantha and chawal ki kheer from this place  parantha was okay okay . they added a lot of salt which made it taste very bad chawal ki kheer was also okay try to work more on the taste good luck
4.0,"Went to this place last week with my friend. Location is near the main road but little away from the road. Beautiful place , ambience is good , happening place. But it serves only veg and authentic Punjabi food ,no doubt on the taste it's just awesome. Also it's cheaper . The boys are good here and provides the best service.Love to visit again."
5.0,"Best north indian food in bangalore according to me. The paneer bhurji is to die for, and so are the ghee phulkas..The reason why my account balance was in 2 digits after 20th of each month is this restaurant xP Achint Jain   But I've heard the quality got compromised very soon after my first visit. Have had to wait for 45 minutes or even more for a table. One advice for the owner. Just keep the price low and maintain your taste, your restaurant will flourish in more ways than one!"
1.0,Food did not suit any of me or my family members. Have been having indigestion and vomiting. Prices did not match quality. While we were coming out of the restaurant found a dead bandicoot outside.
4.0,"Whenever my brain reminds me to have punjabi food! I end up here.   Its kind of little shabby place, but when you listen to those punjabi tracks and the punjabi framed posters, it kicks you in!   You should keep trying the whole menu, i loved the parathas and their lassi/chaas.   Best part is their patiala dry fruit lassi!"
4.0,"Had been avoiding this place from a quiet time as its a pure veg restaurant.But then on a fine day decided to go there,the entrance is kinda Lil narrow,and on top of that it was raining so it was all muddy.Food served was substantial.If u go for a good ambience,its nt a nice place,but then when its come to food definitely it is."
4.5,"The best place to eat....mix parata with butter was awesome and heaven...should try mix parata, french fries chillies.....service is also good.."
3.5,"Went to this place on a sunday evening, tou our surprise we got our table quite quick. This place is quite popular for their north indian food, specially their paranthas. Coming to ambience, it is given an ambience of a punjabi dhabas, with cooler and funny posters about punjabis, Taste: The food overall is ok in taste. We had ordered pakoras/fritters which were not that good. Dal tadka and onion khasta paratha was very good. Panner sabzi was quite ok. The punjabi lassi was best out of all. Service -4/5 Food - 3.5/5 Ambience- 4/5"
4.0,"We went to kapoor's Cafe for lunch.....pindi chole bhature are delicious.... We also ordered aloo paratha, paneer paratha and patiyala Lassi... Paratha had generous amount of stuffing and butter.. Lassi was served in earthen glass and was tasty... Although ambiance is average food componsates for it..."
1.0,It's horrible simply horrible... I went there sometime back I was craving Punjabi food.. I quickly pulled out Zomato to find out possible options.. this place had highly respectable rating so I decided to head there.. I had to wait for about an hour to get a seat and another half an hour for the food to get delivered to my table.... To simply put up the food was horrible I ordered Rajma rice and my friends ordered Malai Kofta... We started off with the lassi. The Lassi was way too sweet for my taste.. I've never tasted such horrible rajma ever in my life... And the Malai Kofta we should have ordered that after the meal cause it was more like a desert than a main course as a somebody and I had tons of sugar to it... Simply horrible.
3.5,"Kapoor's cafe has been in my list from ages. Considering now they have opened branches I wanted to try HSR one but something dragged me to this Branch as I felt it will be more authentic and tasty  considering it's their 1st branch.  Place was crowded and there is waiting which is expected. The place is in a compound giving that garage kinda vibe but its more like a bit developed dhaba.   We finally managed to get the table and ordered for famous cheese burst parata and paneer combo. Also ordered for patiala lassi and butter milk .   Parata was amazing, loads of cheese and decently spiced, spread some nice tomato and onion.  Paneer combo was average, like the aloo Sabji more than paneer .  Lassi and buttermilk were very disappointing. The lassi seems more like curd and buttermilk had no taste .."
4.0,"Feels like a dhaba when you enter . Awesome place for parathas. Everything in this place has a very good taste. If you like cheese , then cheese paratha is something which you will like for sure."
2.0,"Overrated and not my money's worth. Ordered parathas, lassi and chole. The parathas barely had any filling and overall the food tasted ordinary."
5.0,What an Amazing place for Punjabi food. A Must place to go for anyone who lives here in whitefield. i fullfill my cravings for panneer and aloo parathas only here!
4.5,"Tried mix paratha which is a mix pf aloo, paneer, onion and many more. It was served a hell of butter, its a lot more for people who are trying to loose weight. The paratha tasted damn awesome. The only complaint against the management is they should provide curd along with paratha and not something that needs to be ordered as extra. We have even tasted the lassi, it was definitely an authentic heavy punjabi lassi and tasted too good. Definitely a very recommendable place for ppl around it.  Food:4.5/5 Ambience:3.5/5 Hospitality:4/5 Value for money:5/5"
4.0,"Kapoors Cafe was on my bucket list for ages -thanks to the reviews and word of mouth recommendations but I never got to go thanks to its location. One fine day, thanks to my craving for good north Indian food I finally did make my mind to go.  The place is situated inside a compound and the word 'cafe' is a bit of a misnomer - it's more of a high end dhaba.  The menu is relatively limited as compared to most north Indian restaurant but the quality of food certainly made up for it. The Dal Makhani was simply amazing and the Paneer dish wasn't too bad. The phulkas and the Paranthas were well made. The drinks we ordered completely complemented our meal.  I literally scraped off the last bit of Dal off the tumbler - that says it all about this place.  Food - 4.5/5 Ambience - 3.5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Value for money - 4.5/5"
1.0,"219 bucks for a dry fruit lassi, and by dry fruits i mean some shredded almonds! ridiculous! i mean i dont mind payin, but why shud i, for something so lame, it tasted exactly like curd with sugar, thats all. may be alittle malai and 219 for that?? and the parathas here are nothin great that people hype about! u can get them anywhere! this is a sub standard place, falsely reviewed!"
4.5,Great food. Decent ambience and decent service. You might be tempted to order more than you can eat seeing the menu. I got carried away and ordered more than i can eat. Would recommend to order one by one.
1.0,Not great. Below expectation of d rating shown..didn't like the food at all chawal ka kheer was too bad... Rajma thali was not good ... Paneer was not fresh ...
4.0,Kapoors cafe is situated adjacent to old gurukul badminton court. Have been here countless number of times mostly for their much talked paratha and lassi. They have the typical punjabi taste buds satisfying cuisine. Don't go there if you are very health conscious as all items will be soaked in butter. Dry fruit lassi is among all time haves. Aaloo paratha and gobhi paratha are worth try. They have good veg curry options too
4.0,"Great North Indian food !! Lassi is a must try.. Place is crowded on the weekends, but the place is worth it. Good food, not that great ambience.."
4.5,"If you are planning to go to kapoors,starve yourself from the previous day!!! Food is really tasty and at the same time so filling that people struggle to finish whatever they have ordered.I am not a fan of lassi ,but kapoors dry fruit lassi is an exception.A must visit place if you are in whitefield."
4.5,I had came to this place. It was very taste. I had never seen a punjabi hotel like this. The food was so tasty that my mouth was watery. When the food came it looked like I am eating a food which no body ate.l just love the hotel .I wish if it improve more.
3.0,"Food is ok .... Not worth the price. It is over hyped, as a Punjabi dhaba. Totally not worth the money. The food is not bad but nothing special."
3.5,"Long time desire of visiting this place after looking the rating of this place, finally came to an end today. We went there for lunch. Disappointing is what i will say. Not so good service. Ambience.. Dont ask for it. Food is ok for the options u get there. A punjabi restaurant with no tandoor item. No naan. Kulcha that too the packed ones. Overpriced is my final rating for this place."
3.0,Recent Review Food quality and taste have worsened.  The best Pindi Chole south of The Vindhyas. Amazing food. Great service. One waiter did irritate me with his smug disposition and arrogant speech. But I'll overlook that as a one-off scenario.
4.0,"I had heard a lot about this place from everyone around and this was a must visit place for me. Hence I decided to finally give it a try on a Saturdayafternoon. Locating this restaurant is definitely an issue as it is inside a compound and the sign board pointing it is barely visible. Hence you would probably end up asking someone about the place, but the good thing is there is a parking space in the compound. They do not take reservations but getting a table is usually not difficult even if it is crowded.  They have a decent seating ambience but would have been better if they kept a dhaba ambience considering their menu. The walls have some amazing quotes about Punjabis which is not only hilarious but very relatable for all of us. But the place is tiny so if there are a lot of people then there's too much noise for someone to have a decent conversation with their friends. I would not call it a date venue but definitely a place for large groups and families and mostly a place for brunch/lunch. The staff is extremely polite and very quick in their service.  The menu has all punjabi items that you can think of. We ordered the aloo paratha, paneer paratha, assorted pakoras, pindi chole bature, lassi and butter milk. The parathas here are to die for, they are not only delicious but they are served with a spoonful of butter which just adds to the already amazing taste. One paratha is enough for one person but we tend to get ambitious around this kind of food. The pakoras just remind you of the rainy days at home with a cup of chai. Pindi cholebature would definitely take the trophy as I was already full but I ended up finishing the whole thing as it was just so good. That item is a must try. For the lassi and butter milk you can just not stop with one. Everyone ends up ordering multiple of those. The dishes are very cheap especially when you compare it to its quantity.  This place is a must visit for everyone. I can bet you would start speaking punjabi the moment you enter this place even if you don't know it.  Food  4.5/5 Ambiance  3/5 Service  4/5 Cost  4.5/5 Location  3/5"
1.5,"Starters were served warm, we ordered assorted pakoras all the pakoras are mild warm ... Within couple of minutes they served roties and paratoas , by the time we finish starters roties become cold.. for two we paid around Rs.750/ - completely dissatisfied, prices were increased recently.. will not return again.. I was a regular customer once."
4.0,"Had been hearing about this place for a while but was avoiding it for being a Pure Veg restaurant. But this saturday while crossing Kundanahalli my Dad reminded me that you were saying about this Punjabi place lets try it.  The entrance is bit narrow and its adjacent to Gurukul Sports Academy. We had some difficulty in getting the seat as owing to power cut they were reluctant to switch on every fan. We ordered Paneer parantha, Aloo parantha, missi roti, Matar Mushroom, Paneer Butter Masala, Dal Makhani n 3 glass of lassi n plain rice  Pros- The ambiance is good with Punjabi culture depicted everywhere , cartoon n jokes covering the walls Parantha's and Dal Makhani were reminesence of what one gets in North. Full marks for that. Service was decent n fast Quantity was sufficient.  Cons- Lassi was very sweet and thick.  Paneer butter masala was too tangy and salty. Very Disappointing Matar mushroom was tasteless.  We had a kind of pendulum feeling while reviewing this place where it kind of started as 5+ place then ploughed down to 3 but overall will settle at 4.  Do visit for the paranthas n dal makhani and may be lassi. Nevertheless very much a North Indian treat in South of India so do try once."
4.5,Have heard a lot about this place and ordered a couple times from my weekend breakfast. Finally went to this place on Sunday Afternoon with couple of friends. On reaching the place was bit apprehensive about the food. It's like small place off from main road with dusty around Cafe. But as soon as I entered it was almost full.   Immediately got a table and I liked the ambience with a Punjabi feel given to the place with Desi Punjabi music which don't often get to hear in bangalore.   Ordered Panner Parantha - which is big and greatly stuffed and huge chunk of butter. For people from Delhi who so often go to Murthal for Paranthas.. Comparable to Amrik dhaba's parantha.   Pindi Chole Bathure - loved the chole cooked in Delhi style and the quantity was good along with aloo subzi..   Patiala Lassi - was quite thick and should be thinner. Had to eat that with a spoon. But tastes awesome  Food - 5 Ambience - 3.5 Service - 5  Costed around 900INR for 3 folks.
4.5,"The cheese pataka balls are a great experience by themselves.(Try to see if you can handle the spice)I would suggest ordering a sweet lassi just to mange and finish the cheese pataka balls.The cheese paratha is my absolute favourite.If you are a cheese lover and nothing is too much cheese for you ,then you must try it.Its served with an amazing amount of butter too.Not for people on a diet but definitely for people with taste buds.Also ,the first time its a little confusing to understand where the place is but once you understand its easy to find it :)"
1.5,"Overly hyped North Indian restaurant, prices are way high, 150 rs for a mediocre plate of chole bhature, felt like a knife on pocket. Won't suggest this place to authentic north indian foodie."
1.0,"What was one of the best north indian restaurant once, has now reduced to a below average restaurant by all means. Have been noticing it for last few orders. Was served cold tasteless paneer paratha in my last order."
3.5,The first thing about this place is its damn affordable.  You get lip smacking paranthas over here. I also tried the lassi over here. My overall experience was quite good. I even tried their cheese burst paranthas. They were quite good too.
4.0,This place with Punjabi Dhaba feel is awesome. One must have Aloo-pyaz paratha with dry fruit lassi there. This restaurant has punjabi feel and it plays good music. Highly recommended if you stay near Marathahalli.
4.0,This is my go to place for dinner. This little cafe serves the best Punjabi food. I come here so often I've tried out pretty much the entire menu. Here's a list of things I simply love. French fries Punjabi style Pataka cheese balls Chole meal Paneer butter masala Cheesy paratha Lassi The lassi here is divine. It is the best I have ever had and I probably ever will.
4.0,"One of the most authentic Punjabi hotels. The essence of milk-based foods in all dishes was present thoroughly.  Starters aren't their forte. Its main course that is best here. Had Cheese burst paratha, Paneer paratha and Aloo pyaaz paratha. Every paratha had a thick brick of butter over it and the taste it brought was apire bliss. Dhabe ki dal was just perfect.  With the pocket-friendly prices, it's really worth all the appreciation."
5.0,Very good authentic Punjabi food like kadai paneer with tasty patiala lassi. You can enjoy good Punjabi food here ............ Vivek Tamrakar
1.0,"You guys really have NO SENSE, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,  Note down My order number 28089950 order at 8pm, and you people are saying ""we are cancelling the order"" at 9pm, what BS is this..   And return my money 7 days later, which world are you living. I will never order or recommend anyone to use Zomato delivery - Ashok"
1.0,"Hotel owner was quite rude. We were denied food even though we reached 10 mins before the closing time.  Staffs didn't care to take an order an we were replied ""the kitchen is closed ""  When i asked them about the timings thy didn't reply and started having their own lunch."
4.5,"Finger licking parathas with loads of butter ! Food is exceptional , service and ambience compliments the theme of the place.  Apart from parathas everything else is overpriced."
4.5,This place is awesome. One must have Aloo paratha and lassi there. This restraunt has punjabi feel and it plays good music.  Must visit there if you stay near Marathahalli.
4.0,"Good food but bad service. Went during summer I have to wait with my family for around 40 minutes to get the table, after several call to waiter we got food, taste was good but due to hot we didn't enjoy our lunch. They should have improved their sitting arrangements etc. so that people can enjoy food."
3.5,"Ahhh cheese paratha is must try... We started with starters paneer pakoda, peri peri fries and cheese balls all good in taste and quantity...then their speciality paratahas which we tasted all...and at last lassi which was thick and served in kulladh but I prefer lassi being made fresh.."
1.0,My worst experience. I ordered food free m Zomato and kapoor's cafe was unable to deliver. After that I ordered from other restaurants they deliver on time
4.0,"Punjabi to the hilt, this place has an authentic dhaba feel to it and the Punjabi music just adds to that. A vegetarian restaurant which believes that food without copious amounts of ghee and butter is not Punjabi food.The food is absolutely delicious and the portions substantial. Not a place to go if you are looking for great ambience but if you are in a mold for some good food and really really hungry, this is the place.Absolutely loved it. only issue is there is no parking space for cars"
5.0,"Just moved to my flat in this area a week ago and someone recommended me this place. And I thank the Gods, both the old and the new, for that. We were three of us who shared Aloo Parantha, Paneer Parantha, Missi Roti and Malai Kofta among us. And my word it was amazing. To have such an awesome Punjabi Food Joint in walking distance was a dream come true. If you ever come by this area, visit this place for sure, you won't regret it."
4.0,"Went on a Sunday afternoon arnd 3:30, n found it to be reasonably empty. Usually it's very crowded.  We had amazing chole bhature, super good lassi n chaach, masala papad, delicious dal n paneer with pudina Parantha, huge Gobhi Parantha with loads of butter. Overall awesome meal! Only thing we missed was naan, somehow it felt that dal n paneer will go well with naan/khulche."
4.0,Ohh Good Aloo Pyaaz Paratha served with a lob of butter and mint chutney.. quick on service... creative and colourful interior and calue for money
4.0,"I am just enthralled the way these guys have setup a Punjabi food hub out of nowhere. The food, the taste, the ambience is simply cool. If you're longing for that lip smacking Punjabi taste, all roads then lead to this place. Quite tricky to locate and always running house full, this place is the one I visit regularly. Cost: Average Food Quality:4 Star Ambience: 4 Star Location: 3.5 Star Recommended dishes: Aloo Paratha, lassi, Thali...  The one thing I miss is the Non-Veg version of Kapoor's Cafe. Wish they can open up !  Happy Fooding... :)"
2.0,Good food good price good place to hangout with your squad if you guys are tight on your budget. I loved the lassi out here and yes they really got good potato finger chips. Update : taken off 1 rating due to bad food delivered.
3.5,"Reviewer: Sanjay Vyas Vegetarian only.  Went there on a weekday, Tuesday. Decent crowd considering that it was Tuesday.   I will start with the best thing I had there. And hands down it was the Cheesy balls. I have forgotten the exact name in the menu but they were worth every penny. Soft melting balls of cheese along with green chilly chutney, it was too tempting to ignore.  We had cheese burst parantha as well. Which was good for people who have hots for cheese. It's like cheesy orgasm for cheese lovers. Tow paranthas and in between there is like truck load of cheese and on top of that too a big chunk of butter. Too much cheese for my personal liking but it tasted well.  Third we took masala papad, not good at all. Too spicy. And no masala at all.   We took panner butter masala and Punnjabi dal tadka as well for main course.   Panner butter masala was average and not as per the ""Punjabi"" reputation maintained at the place. On the other hand Punjabi dal tadka was everything it promised to be. Punjabi dal tadka was like cherry on top of the Cheesy balls I had earlier.  Last but not the least I tasted the much hyped ""Patiala lassi"" which was served in traditional kulhad and it slightly disappointed me because I have had great Punjabi lassi before. If you don't judge the lassi by the punjabiness it carried it it's name and repo than it was good. Nice sweet flavours. But just because it was tagged Patiala lassi and purely going on that standard it could be better. It was too thick for it to be authentic Punjabi lassi.   Overall the experience was good on food front. Coming to ambience and service.   Service was fast and all servers were soft spoken and  polite.  Ambience is like just another crowded place. Lots of people talking and lots of thing happening around. Not ideal for people wanting a peaceful quiet place to eat but if you love such energy around you then it's a good place to be at.   Might as well give it a second try l, just to try the other flavours of parantha. And on price front it's not too expensive niether too cheap. Its decent."
4.0,"Nice place with Punjab Tadka. They have tried their every bit to give it a Punjab Dhaba feeling to the customers out there. The food is good and the menu items are interesting. Lassi the serve is awesome. Just for having Lassi, I've been here many a times. Not to forget Parathas they serve along with butter. Liked the place and food"
5.0,"One of the best places for North Indian food in Bangalore, Kapoor's Cafe, with its food and its Punjabi ambience is a place to go to for all foodies. Do try their Punjabi fries, paneer pakodas , cheese paranthas and lassi.  You will feel wholly satisfied, and the additional calories intake is totally worth it :)"
1.0,There Arrogance will ruin there future business . The waiter are pathetic and doesn't want to hear anything as if everything is pre recorded . I have been to this place umpteen no of times but never it happened that any rude behaviour was there . This time I  giving low rating due to there rude behaviour.   Kindly improve .
4.0,"This is some Punjabi joint which is really awesome. It's like typically Punjabi thali and paratha. Do not any lavish ambience , just be there if your love of Punjabi food. I ordered pindi chole bhature and mixed veg paratha and also lassi . The pindi chole was awesome . One should try lassi which they serve in kullah( Mudpot). Service and staff were good too"
4.0,"This place a good find for North Indian food. Tucked into a corner just besides the main road, this place has a good menu to offer from, fast service and good tasty food. It is not all that expensive as well. For a nice Saturday afternoon lunch with friends, this is a good place to go.. but only (good) veg food"
1.0,"Horrible experience.  Went with my mother 2 weeks back to have some pictures habits food.  Started with a Lassee and Masala Papad, the choice for papad given to be fried in oil tandoori. The fried masala papad was cold and the masala used made us literally puke and kept it aside. The lassee was good.  Then came the punjabi fries, pretty much similar taste as the papad and after somehow finishing half, kept it aside. Also need iron tooth to chew them. By this time, I felt really sorry, looking at my mother's eyes. Then came phulka, phulka with ghee and Baigan Bartha. The first bite made me say the f'word, as the disappointment was beyond control. Baigan Bartha was so blunt as if the tandoor Baigan was taken out n smashed with the weirdest of spices available. We both shared 3 out of the 6 phulkas ordered as couldn't withstand the ordeal anymore.  Had a talk with the owner about the bad quality of food and he was not ready to agree with tha fact that the food tasted horrible. Indeed he said, we have the best ratings and no one have ever complained. Left from there disappointed, with the leftover food Parcelled and fed the dogs on way and left them to suffering.

4.0,"I visited the place today for quick dinner,had heard a lot about the place before,liked the ambiance & food.It was nice homely food,little bit spicy though,reasonable pricing . Staff is courteous . Good value for money :)"
2.5,"UPDATE :-  I have to this place once again and the quality have degraded. The taste if saag, sarson saag makke roti combo, was not upto the mark and was just filled with butter.                          This place was long awaited place and many of my friends have recommended this place to try for. The only reason I was hesitant because of the fact that this restaurant do not serve Non-Veg and I generally do not eat Veg when i go out, my bad.  So, it happened to be, few of us arrived at this place as we were out of options with nearby, easy on pocket and go to restaurant. We ordered a lot of items like Kadhai Paneer, Puri Chole, Parathas of various kind (I do not remember the varieties , sarso ka saag combo, lassi and masala cold drinks. I must say it was finger lickingly good and full-filling We also ordered Sahi tukra which was delicious. I loved the service and the taste of authentic punjabi sarso saag and makke roti combo. Lassi could have been better though. I feel the price to be on the higher side though  Over all rating :  Food : 3/5 Price :- 3/5 Ambience : 2/5 Serving : 3/5"
4.0,"What's best about this place is definitely the food. Service is good and ambiance is okay. We ordered Panner and Saag, both were nicely cooked. It is sort of a restaurant you would like to visit once a while"
3.0,"We went to the Thubarahalli branch inside the Gurukul compound on Sunday evening. The wait time was of 10 minutes and the service was fairly quick.   We order a paratha combo. While gobhi paratha was good, aloo pyaz paratha was a let down. The boondi raita wasn't great. Shahi Tukda was disappointing with the bread not fried or toasted nor coated with sugar syrup. It was served cold and tasted more like plain bread in milk.   We also ordered a rajma fulka combo. The fulkas were hard and rajma was too spicy to eat. Jeera aloo wasn't properly boiled and was quite hard.   All in all don't go for combos. Only gobhi paratha was good."
4.0,Went to Kapoor cafe seeing great reviews.. but felt bit over hyped place.. food was ok. Had Channa batoora which was way too oily ..but the curry was awesome..and lassi which they charge way too much was not that great too.. in short words over priced food.. only rice items seemed to be good..and curry quantity was lesser than normal..  Went for a second visit on 22dec 2017 Had lassi.. it was totally lipsmacking and aloo pyaaz paratha the butter on it was so delicious..and the quantity of paratha was enuf for a person ..then tried combo of paneer butter masala ..the curry was way too spicy for paneer butter masala.. over all great taste..
5.0,One of the best authentic Punjabi food place in Bangalore for vegetarians. Liked the starters and parathas alot here. Worth going every time your crave for them.
4.0,"The place is tucked away inside a small lane, will probably miss it you don't notice the board outside on the main road. The ambience is as Punjabi as it can get, right from the music to uniforms of the waiters, you feel like you are in punjab itself. The food was delicious and is worth very penny"
2.0,Paneer paratha had very little stuffing and chutney was spoilt. Buttermilk had too much salt. Quality of paneer was also not good. Matar paratha had a large chunk of ginger.
3.0,"Been there a few weeks ago and ordered their Combo 3. They serve 2 parathas of your choice, raitha, lassi and a sweet. The cost is 280/-... seemed quite expensive for the quantity/choice available. They dump a huge dollop of butter in the parathas. It is dhabha style ambiance, so no A/C etc... but clean. The food tasted just ok... nothing very authentic."
4.5,"Great place to be with your friends, family or room mates.  Frequented mostly by the bachelor folks in and around Whitefield area and families during weekends. Fun=punjabi. Owner is passionate and serious about the food he cooks. Swadisht is the word that comes to my mind. Quantity is right for the hard working farmer from punjab. Be cautious on the number of items you order.  Do not waste food by ordering too much. Food is so tasty that you don't feel like wasting it but at the same time, you can't finish it. Place gets too hot during summer. Staff is quick, courteous and helpful. Expect a huge crowd during weekends"
3.0,"Been to the Kapoors Cafe thrice so far. Being a punjabi myself I had high expectations from the place, but the food did not live up to my expectations all the 3 times. Visit1- aloo paratha and lassi - order was served very late and it was extremely oily Visit2- we were here for breakfast and ordered aloo puri.. it was well served and decent but cannot rate ir more than 3.5/5 visit3- this time we tried going here for a casual evening dinner. Tried dal makhni( very very good) , paneer (not good.. looked stale due to heat I guess) and baigan bharta(decent). Was a pleasent experience."
1.5,They always send incomplete order wherw butter chutney goes missing worst experience with them.i ordered 4 times and everytime incomplete. Pathetic
3.0,Visited this place after hearing a lot about it but couldn't find a single great thing about this restaurant. Food is average north Indian food. Service is not so good. Ambiance is fine. But it's pricey for no reason. The only good thing about this restaurant is that it is near to my place.
4.5,"I finally got a chance to try this place out and Im so glad I did! We went there for a Sunday Brunch . The place was completely full. The decor is quite simple. There is mild Punjabi music that plays in the background which adds to the dhaba feel . This place is one of the very few places that serves authentic Punjabi food in Bangalore . This place is so pocket friendly that it made me fall in love with it even more. We started off with Chaas ( buttermilk) which was so perfect and exactly what we needed in these hot summer afternoons. After very long I had such good Chhole Bhauture . The best part is the preparation of the chana (exactly how it is made in the north) . We had Chana kulcha thali , kadai paneer , missi roti and dal tadka . Everything that they served was delicious . But special mentions to the dal tadka which was so mouth watering that we had to order another one. A MUST TRY! In the end we ordered Shahi tukra and their Dry fruit Lassi. That dry fruit lassi took me back to the North and I just couldnt believe that something as simple as lassi could taste so heavenly . I dont think anyone makes lassi like they do. So again a MUST TRY! The service is very quick and everyone is really friendly and intercative. Undoubtedly one of the best meals I have had in Bangalore."
5.0,"Delicious food. A haven for north Indian food lovers. One must try out their lassi, so thick and fantastic. Order anything spicy here and you will never regret. This place is a real taste bud opener.                                                                 hungryfang.wordpress.com"
3.0,"Good food, a bit spicy and slightly on a expensive side as compared to portion of food v/s price. Should maintain some hygiene and cleanliness too. Please be informed that this is only a veg restaurant...."
1.0,"I've been following a few threads about Kapoor's cafe and I want to share my horror story too!  I went to Kapoor's Cafe today hoping for some hot parathas and aloo jeera. Everything was fine. The lassi we ordered came, my friend drank till the last sip and THEN....  we saw a rat running past us under the table next to us!!!!!! :O  We told the waiter we wanted to cancel because we saw a rat and he said, ""so what, they don't come near the food"". Yeah right!  I'm truly disgusted by how unhygienic this place is and how callously and nonchalantly the waiters responded to RATS roaming in their restaurant paying a visit to every meal that's served."
1.0,I had ordered pindi chole bature from this restaurant . First of all they delivered it 30 mins late from estimated time and then instead of pindi chole they gave normal chole bature ...This is a very bad experience and they dusht even inform us about the change
4.0,Authentic Punjabi Food. They overload every dish with butter or ghee which is unique to get in southern India. Do try the lassi and cheese balls.
4.5,"Yummmmm... That is the only word which comes to my mind when I think about Kapoor's Cafe. A perfect punjabi food outlet and authentic taste, however they use too much butter....but this what punjabi food is all about. Service is awesome if I judge it on the basis of how much crowd they handle. Try paneer paratha and punjabi chole over there, you might have to stand in the queue for sometime but that is worth it."
4.0,"Whenever I want to eat Veg/Paratha/North Indian, this is my go to place. Can't even recollect how many times I must have visited this place. And I am never disappointed except for rare occasions. Cheese paratha is a must try!"
4.5,"Great vegetarian food. Loved the paranthas. Although I suggest be prepared to wait for your table, specially on weekends. Average waiting time of 20-30 mins."
5.0,Kapoor's Cafe is the place to come to if you love north Indian food. Service is fast and the food is really really delicious.. I have tried almost everything on the menu and most of the items are really yummy...
4.5,My friend took me to this cafe for having north Indian food. Actually I was not able believe having such delicious north Indian food in South India...!!!  We had partha and lassi. Both dishes were extremely tasty yummy etc etc...!!!  All north Indian food lovers should definitely check out this place.
5.0,"The place and food is amazing. Finally found a correct Punjabi/north Indian restaurant in Bangalore. The price is reasonable for the city's standards. Only thing is maybe in the evening, the restaurant can be opened a bit early, like 6 30 pm."
4.0,"This place makes me feel like i am at my home. The food tastes like its been cooked at home. Reasonable price. But service is a bit delayed, it can be because of the more number of people visiting this place. Strongly recommend to try this place."
4.5,"This place in whitefield is really famous for the food!! I have come here multiple times and loved the food...  The taste is really good, have tried almost everything in the menu... Recommended.."
3.5,"When in a craving for Punjabi/North indian Food i go mad here in deep south and start looking for places which can extinguish this fire of having some lip smacking food.My colleagues have always told me too try kapoor's cafe and since residing nearby i went there with my friends on a sunday night.  Kapoor's cafe is located near ITPL and you can ask for ECC road.Its a modern dhabha with some colorful artifacts about punjab and the place is always bustling with crowd.  So back to the main part as we entered we were greeted and asked to wait for couple of minutes as it was already full.Waited for nearly 15 minutes and finally landed on the table.The best thing about the night was that 4/5 of my friends were punjabi too so we were all game for a punjabi fiesta!Buraahhh.  Picked up the Menu and ordered the following: -Masala Papad -Pataka Cheese Balls -Mix pakora's -Lassi -Mix veg -Kadahi/Karahi Paneer -Dal Makhni -Phulka's/Chappati's  Now what i liked about this place is the service is pretty quick and the staff is on its toes to bring things hot and fresh on your table.The staff is friendly too,Marks for hospitality.  Our order was brought in fast even with almost every table filled.  My report about the food: Masala Papad:After a long time had Lizzat/Lijjat papad.The masala was good.Spicy tangy veggies soaked in a marination.They were spicy and good just felt a little less salt could have done wonders.4/5  Pataka Cheese Balls:They were actually a pataka(Bomb) damn they were really good and tasted awesome.Loved the filling inside to the core.Toally recommended 5/5  Mix Veg pakaora-One of the best ive had in Bangalore till date.Fried well and the masala on top was pretty awesome and good.4.5/5  Lassi-Could not have it but my friends said it was okay and could be better so 3/5.  The starters were amazing so i had hoped for a great main course aswell but things went on a downward curve when I had Kadahi paneer and Mix veg.  Kadahi paneer was awful.It was the worst gravy ive ever eaten in my life.I don't know what they were trying to achieve with the semi brown gravy but it lacked taste and only thing i could taste was cinnamon.Guys where are your basic punjabi senses?Kadahi panner is always onion/capsicum dry thick gravy with loads of spices with a tinge of chilly not this good for nothing gravy.Bit dissapointed by the dish il give it a 1/5.  Mix veg:Another bland dish on my table. It had lots of veggies but tastes bland. I mean punjabi food being so bland is disrespectful. I somehow ate it as i was hungry.2/5  Dal Makhni:It was pretty good.Creamy thick awesome.Loved the dal and it reminded me of the Original Dal Makhni back in my homeland. But its placed at 250 bucks and never in my life in india i have seen a Dal makhni placed at a higher rate than a paneer dish so thats pretty weird. Dal was the only thing i liked on the menu 4/5.  Phulka:Now i actually missed the Tandoori Chappati's but for a change had them and it was okay. Nothing much to talk about.  Final verdict: I felt the starteres were awesome and service is well paced.Some dishes were overated and overly priced on the menu ambiance is okay nothing over the top. I will try them again soon but certainly not the dishes i mentioned.Good for a friends day out or a family dinner.  Overall: Service:4/5 Food:3/5 Price:3/5 Ambiance:3/5"
4.5,Awesome food. Ordered cheese paratha and a vegetarian thali along with cold drinks. Bill came in around 600. Sumptuous food for 2 people. Great in taste. Awesome ambience.  Food - 4.5/5 Service - 3.5/5 Ambience - 4.5/5
3.5,I went with my family here. The crowd is cute as compared to place. We ordered paratha and Gobi matar and aloo dum. The gobi matar was not properly cooked. We asked to change but it was not saying it is like this only.
4.0,"Awesome place! Food is too good! Its completely like a punjabi dhaba. Worth every penny. We ordered parathas, fruit cream, chaas, etc. Fruit cream is too good, also try cheese burst paratha. Ambience is very cool for youngsters and its light on your pocket."
4.5,"My friend talked very much about this place and took me there on his birthday. Aaloo k paranthe with bohot sara makkhan.. yummy food... Masala Cold drink ,chhaas and lassi which was served in small kullads that was quite impressive and was very fresh.  Used to go there everyday and tried almost everything . Awesome place for punjabi/northIndian food lover. Must try - Winter special thali with sarso ka saag and makki ki roti."
2.0,"this was my 4th time to the Kapoor's Cafe.  earlier experiences were average to good.  this time i ordered 2 thalis.both were served after waiting time of 20 min.  all the items were cold(including rotis), still they took 20 min. to serve.  for extra 2 rotis, they again took 10 min.  food was tasteless.  each time for ordering i had to wave my hands till somebody notices  (we reached there at 12:30PM,we observed waiters were eating from that time on till we left the place.so, they were busy to notice us)."
3.5,"We heard about this place from friends who had visited here and they gave pretty good reviews about it. So one fine afternoon we decided to try it out ourselves. It is a little difficult to find except for a large hoarding on the road; you have to go into a small muddy lane (would be an adventure in the monsoon).  Getting there: (2/5): One banner on the road, leading you into a bumpy, muddy lane with open parking just beyond the restaurant. About 20 - 25 cars can fit there at the most. Very narrow lane and any vehicle in the opposite direction can cause a clog.  Ambience: (3.5/5): During the day it is very hot as it is not air conditioned and has a tin roof. Loud music and usually crowded with a mix crowd. A good place for time out with friends and family.  Food: (3/5): Pure Vegetarian place. The parathas are good with a big blob of butter on each (people on perennial diets, please avoid going here). We tried two different main course gravies and both had too much garam masala that ruined it for us. The combo thalis though are good and so are the chaas and lassi. Pros: Paratha, Combo Thali, Chaas, Lassi Cons: Main Course Gravies  Cost: (3.5/5): Not exactly a 'bargain' place, but definitely cheaper than most other places serving North Indian cuisine.  Verdict: Visit at least once."
3.5,"good food. Parathas were really nice. Huge size with lot of butter. Gravies tasted good too. I expected a better lassi though , this being a punjabi food joint."
4.0,"Best north Indian veg food in bangalore?? Probably kapoors cafe.. Love the pindi chhole, kachori sabzi, paneer butter masala, daals and yes the parathas with a big butter block..thats almost everything :)  One of those places where I keep going back to."
5.0,It's a place for people who love the essence of North Indian cuisine and Punjabi cuisine in particular. Lovely ambience with old and new Punjabi songs playing and has the get up of a dhaba. Fast service and courteous staff. Now coming to the food...i loved it. It's very very Desi in the way it is prepared and the taste is amazing. Price is reasonable and totally worth it. Some of items I tried were Shahi paneer and dhabe ki daal. All of the items were very well prepared. Will love to go to this place again and again.
3.5,"Paratha's are really nicely filled , taste good with butter and curd . I Ordered Aloo , Onion and Paneer paratha . All are good in taste perfectly medium spicy. Sweet lassi also taste good .  On Weekends it's little crowded and always need to wait and less space to sit. It's good for people who wants to spend less money with stomach full food Total value for money. Token system for getting seat is little irritating as you need to wait outside but after getting seat will forgot all of that.  Food : 3.5/5 Service : 3/5 Value for Money : 4/5"
4.0,"One of the best Punjabi restaurants in town that serve mouthwatering Punjabi delicacies, I have gone there 3-4 times with family, always crowded with people, place is not so big, with decent ambience in terms of looks and decoration, you can enjoy your food with nice background music, good thing they have ample space at back side so u can easily park your vehicles.  Food is what attracts crowd here and when it comes to delicious Punjabi food no one can say no. For Starters I have tried there Cheese Balls which was bit on oily side but taste was perfect, Kalmi Punjabi sticks  served with Garlic sauce was again healthy and scrumptious, but best of the lot was French fires in Punjabi style , it will give you that zesty effect , the extra pinch to your flavor buds which surely everyone will love.  Now let me talk about their big Parathas, Personally  I love there Paneer Paratha its really quite big with lods of butter on top and what to say its melt in mouth, very good stuffing inside and quite yummy. They have other specialties in Paratha like Khasta Parathas which are made up of whole wheat which is quite healthy and tasty.   In Main course we have tried there Dhable ke Dal, Panner Butter Masala, Mix veg, I love there dal, they serve in small steel bucket shape its quite flavorsome with lot of garnishing and cream on top. Panner was quite soft and the gravy is full of spices accompanied by Onions and capsicum. Mix Veg was again on good side.  For drinks we opted for Masala Cold drink and Butter Milk which was served in small kullads that was quite impressive and was very fresh.  The service is good but still I would say needs improvement , we had to remind them several time for things , they should try to bring all the food at one go I wont mind waiting 10 min extra but we should get everything so that we should not have to wait for the dishes.  Overall I am quite happy with this place, as I can go anytime and enjoy good food, its surely a VFM, and personally I would say rates are reasonable. Will surely recommend this place to other friends and family members.  I heard they are opening 3rd Outlet in HSR soon so best of luck to you guys for your new outlet, I am sure you people will rock there too.  Overall Rating: 4  Food: 4.5/5  Service: 3.5/5  Ambiance: 3.5/5"
4.5,"Being a non vegetarian enthusiast, it's difficult to settle for only veg. But that all changed after eating from Kapoor's Cafe! The food is good, ambience is good and most importantly, the hospitality is on spot! Love their 3 cheese paratha and lassi!"
3.0,"This place is near my office. I had been here thrice. Its the best place to have parathas and punjabi food. Ambience is good and food too. Staffs are friendly and service is fast. Pocket friendly, Best place for lunch and dinner if you are working in/near whitefield. Since there are no much places to have good food in whitefield, this place will satisfy your hunger."
5.0,"I absolutely love this place, always always crowded and by people who definitely know how good the food is! Everything on the menu is yummy, I have tried almost everything.."
3.0,"Good but not great...  I visited Kapoor's Cafe  around a week back with 3 of my friends, the major reason behind my visit being the rave reviews. Not to mention it sits right beside my apartment and doesn't require any planning or effort for a casual visit.  The good:  1. We ordered several items. Started with a portion of assorted pakoras and they turned out to be pretty nice. The paneer inside them was soft and they were fresh out of the wok. The green chutney was delicious as well.  2. The second order was for 2 parathas: 4 cheese and matar. Both of them were huge in size and served with almost half a bar of butter which required some serious effort while smearing as it seemed that it will never get over (YES!! It was that big). Both the parathas were adequately stuffed and were amazing in taste.  3. The dry fruit lassi and the butter milk were heavenly as well.  4. The service was quick enough and they never made us wait for too long between the multitudes of sub orders we placed.  5. The staff too was very polite and eager to serve always with a smile on their face.  The bad:  1. After the scrumptious serving of parathas the main course was sort of a downer. We ordered kadahi paneer and khasta paratha to subdue our hunger fangs finally and were pretty much disappointed. The paneer gravy was termed as super spicy by the waiter but turned out to be sweetish. They need to understand that a town obsessed with andhra cuisine really needs some spice when you tell them such a thing. It wasn't spicy even from Punjabi standards.   The khasta paratha too wasn't that great and tasted and looked like a normal paratha.  2. All said and done they really need to lower their prices a bit in my honest opinion. I found Kapoor's Cafe  to be over hyped and over priced, and might not visit them again unless I am too lazy to walk a few extra steps."
4.5,All things Punjabi! Cuisine as well as music.I absolutely loved how they serve buttermilk in small clay pot. Cheese balls were too spicy for me and I couldn't eat more than one. Their parathas and the dollop of butter that they add on it are heaven for a foodie soul like me.  Prices are fair and service quick.Enough reasons to visit this place quite often. How I wish they make one here in Pune.
5.0,This restaurant in whitefield is for everyone who missed home food! The place ain't that huge but the food is so so damn good.  Always crowded but quick service. Love the food.
4.0,The menu is soooo traditionally appetizing.. parathas and roti with ghee.. lassi was mind blowing and something as simple as jeera aloo also tasted heavenly.. Pind ki yaad dilanewala dhaba wala cafe!!  Great job..=
1.0,"Very average place. Definitely over hyped. Came here for lunch. Kadai paneer was tasteless and so was malai kofta. Things are overpriced for what they had to offer. Even the lassi was really bad, it was overly sweet ( I like sweets , but lassi was very over sweet )."
1.0,Quality of food has been degraded. Was fond of Kapoor's ka khana. But for past few months quality has been really degraded. Not expected from Kapoor's
1.5,"I very rarely write a review and I am somehow very compelled to write this as it might help fellow eatery freaks like me. The food taste was good or i thought it was until the desert arrived. I got a steel string, yes! a steel string the one which is used to wash utensils at our home, in my desert. This was awful to say the least. What was more awful was the way the staff reacted to my complaint. Neither did they feel apologetic about the incident nor did they offer replace the desert nor did they reduce the same from the bill. I noticed that they wash the utensils within the kitchen and there isn't any partition separating the kitchen from the wash area which is extremely dirty and unhygienic. (I agree that we do not get to see behind the curtain in most restaurants, but when you do its very uneasy). One of the most disgusting experiences. Please avoid this hotel."
3.5,Slightly overpriced. The ambience is good. Owner and staffs are friendly. Lassi steals the show. It is difficult to get a table on weekends. Ideal for vegetarians.
3.5,"Finally found a good place for paratha in this part of Bangalore. If they had not messed up my order I would have rated them 4.Still I will visit this place again  Had ordered a paneer butter masala combo, aloo piyaz paratha and chhole bhature. The paratha was the best I have had in a long time. They put generous amount of butter on it. The chhole bhature was also good. The paneer butter masala combo was below average. The rice was very dry . When served, the phulka was hot and ok but became chewy within 5 minutes.  The lassi was great would have loved to have a big one if they had not messed up my order.  The messed up big time on the order. Before they gave the menu, they served two matkas of lassi. We had not ordered it but all servers were busy and nobody listened to us. We had to consume it. They served paratha and the thali immediately but there was no signs of chhole bhature. After waiting for some time I enquired. Seems like the waiter had forgotten to write chhole bhature on the note. They need to work on the service part."
2.0,Extremely oily food. Oil is floating in all subjis. Taste is good if oil and butter used is lesser and served on the side. Also.m I think artificial colour is used.
2.5,I ordered from this restaurant thrice through swiggy . First time food was amazing . The parathas were mouth watering yum . Second time the shit storm began . The phulkas were not edible hard rubbery tasteless. Third and last time today food tasted good . Then we had a stomach upset . Something was wrong . I am never eating here or ordering from here ever again.
3.5,Great Punjabi food.. But I liked the most was kheeerrrr... Chilled and perfectly cooked.  I can just go again and again for that superb kheer. Bangalore mein Punjab ka swaaad..
4.0,"Now this is what you call Punjabi food. Such is their taste is, I never get tired of visiting them.  The ambiance is some what fine, looking at the location, this is the best what they could do. They posters and the way they have set up small small things, is something amazing.  food is soo goodd, spcly the kachori sabzi and puri sabzi, which is a breakfast item, but they serve till 3 P.m which is just so great. i could sit and eat that kachori all day. The lassi, the malai kofta, the dal. Everything tastes like home. i would highly recommend them to have a tandoor. Thats the only thing missing. Dont try the missi roti, cz that is cooked on gas, and doesnt tastes that good as its chapati.  The service is good and fast, Everyone is so friendly, spcly the owner.  The menu is not that big, and i would say they do justice to the menu. Clearly they have mentioned that at what times, what items would not be available. which is great and helpful.  The cost is quite reasonable, and one can visit them every other day easily.  One noticeable thing is that, it is a bit difficult to find the restro, not visible from the main road, and google map is confusing. they have put up a big hoarding to come up with this, but that also gets hidden behind the tree. They should work on this in order to boost up their sales.  If you are a Punjabi, and missing home, go here and feel a bit closer to your place. :)"
4.0,"Decent Punjabi dabha in Whitefield, on Varthur road. Do try out the parathas and lassi here (obvious, isn't it!) The food was closest to the authenticity that you might get in Bangalore."
5.0,"Kapoors is our second home right from the time they opened this branch near G R Techpark. Everything here is so so yumm and authentic. The manager and the staff are so polite and attentive. I personally love thw Mixed veg paratha, Punjabi style french fries, lassi! But I have tried almost everything here, Pindi chole is amazing too."
2.0,Again an overrated place. The food is average and nothing sumptuous about it. I have been to better punjabi restaurant in this case. Overall a decent place with good food but overly priced.
3.5,Chilled out place wit awesome punjabi songs playing in the background. No parking space available. The lassi was awesome. Paranthas were a bit of a turn off.
4.5,Best to fill ur punjabi appetite. Chilly cheese bombs are a must have . They are too spicy but totally worth it. Paranthas - Chandigarh special is the best with loads of makhan and chass. Its great value for money place.
2.5,"I was excited to hear about this place, but was disappointed by the food when I ordered it. Well the dal tadka was absolutely fine but the paneer dishes are not good at all and so was dal makhani."
2.5,"I know this place has a huge fan following. All the time it's crowded...but somehow it has always disappointed me. Every time ( I gave it three chances, just because it's such a fav of others ) I got weird food.  They cannot even get basic stuff like aloo jeera, dal tadka and masala papad right.  My experience with kapoors cafe was just passable."
4.0,One of the best Parantha place in Bangalore. Situated within old Gurukul Badminton academy compound. Loved their Cheese Burst parantha. Butter milk and lassi served in kulhad are the best you can get anywhere. Was reminded of North indian highway dhabas. Little costly. Size of paranthas is bigger as compared to other normal parantha place. Authentic punjabi taste. Loved it.
4.0,"Ordered thalli, excellent food with authentic north Indian curries, highly receomended, i liked their Dry Fruit lassi. The hotel is a Dhabha styled and i'm not a big fan of Dhabha themed restaurants.  Ambiance - 2.5/5 Food - 4.5/5 Value for Money - 4.0/5 Service - 4.0/5 Overall - 4.0/5                                                                 foodrestorank.com"
3.5,Decent variety and taste.. though can be better for the price.. rates have increased from last I visited.. service is good but I would like an improvement on taste..
4.0,Always had a good eating experience here as have been multiple times to this place...with lot filling options with north indian desi khaana.
4.5,"Let me ask you something. Can you guess the effect of Aloo Parantha with a block of butter right on top of it to smear it on before having a bite? A total blissful Punjabi cuisine experience right in Bangalore. Trust me when I say this - these guys here probably prepare one of the best paranthas in the entire city. Do try out their Dal Makhani. Its an out of the world experience with fresh Phulkas (rotis). In the end, what left an everlasting mark on my mind was the Dry Fruit Lassi.  The place, despite being somewhat smaller in size comapred to other restaurants, is never too crowded for you not be able to find a seat here. The staff is polite and they do not take much time to serve the freshly-prepared food.  After having a meal here, you will be coming out of the restaurant with some added calories but well, it is worth it. Kapoor's Cafe is seriously a foodie's delight to dine in Bangalore. Although I am not vegan, I would still love to say that this place is one of my favorites in entire Bangalore. I will always recommend this place for the ultimate Punjabi-style cuisine. Hadippa!"

3.5,"For a hardcore non-vegetarian like me, Kapoor's Cafe has got to be one of the rare veg outlets that gets my vote for a hearty meal. They were very packed that Sunday night in January, and handing out tokens for waiting guests. But some efficient management worked in our favor, and we quickly got our table. The stray dogs outside were a nuisance though, and considering the whole pack of them, could be dangerous. Also, some more lighting in the car park area would help.  For that special flavor of Punjab on a winter night, we went for makkai ki roti and sarson ka saag. The saag comes with a dash of unsalted butter in a foil, not to mention that everything here comes with a dash of table butter anyway. The combothalis are great too. Request the waiter for spice advice if you are going with kids, and he'll readily oblige. And the lassi is medium-sweet and very thick, almost like a rabri. Wish they served breakfast as well.  And oh, the multi-layered cheese paranthas were yum!   The dhaba-like atmosphere helps, with the posters and their catchy lines."
4.0,Aloo ke parathe with makkhan. Reminds you of Delhi. Huge meal that will make you skip dinner. Uncle jee at the counter is very enterprising and service is super fast.
2.5,"Either this place is overrated or I went to this place with huge expectations after reading reviews. I found this place average and a tad overpriced. I must admit the butter they serve with the parathas here is very generous. Service is quick but the place is packed, you may have to wait to get a seat... but frankly nothing special about this place.."
3.5,I had tried dal makhani & roti. Liked it. Price list for items on menu are little high considering the ambience and service. Good for veg people.
4.5,"Want typical punjabi food. Worth visit. list to try will go longer.. As food here says try all....  Recommendation : Aloo paratha, lassi, Bread paneer pakora  Ambience : very good. Service : Good Taste : Awesome.  Must visit place to eat.. High in demand. But you will love the food when you eat here."
3.5,Slightly over hyped place. Slow service and anything other than paratha is overpriced. But has a feel-good factor especially because of the creative posters.
3.5,"I recently shifted to Bangalore from Delhi and I guess anyone who shifts from north India to South India craves for proper North Indian cuisine. And moreover I am a Punjabi so parantha with butter and Lassi is a heaven for me.. My friends talked very much about this place and took me there on 26th Jan which was a holiday. After waiting for half an hour, we entered the cafe. I guess it was the holiday or I don't know but it was full with people. I liked the music there as the numbers were hit Punjabi songs of 90s.. The ambiance I can't say much as the place was over crowded here. We ordered paneer pakoras and fries for starters. They were good. For main Course we all had paranthas, what I had planned.. They had pure North Indian taste.. I loved the food.. I guess this place is a must try if you want to have paranthas."
1.0,"Very bad parathas, Aloo parathas are sour, looks like the potatoes are old . very unhygienic kitchen. Punjabi restaurants are known for parathas, surprised to see sour parathas"
4.5,"Good food and lovely ambiance.DO NOT FORGET TO TRY THE LASSI! ELSE, YOU WILL REGRET!  Finding out this place was a task, as it is not on the road. :PBut the food will make you forget everything! Again, LASSI! <3"
1.5,"I have been in kapoors cafe many times over the past 1 year and I have even ordered food online. I can notice that their quality of food has decreased very much, especially parathas and raita. Yesterday I had ordered food from same place and I must say it was a terrible experience. We ordered for mix parathas, aloo pyaz parathas, boondi raita and chaas. Except chaas, nothing was good. Raita tasted as if milk was used instead of curd for preparation. Even the parathas were extremely disappointing. The food was delivered almost one and half hours after ordering and we stay just 2.5kms away from the restaurant. Overall, the delivery experience and the food was pathetic. I have decided never to have food from here."
4.0,"Dhamakedaar punjabi khana with no ifs and buts!! If that's what you are looking for, the buck stops here. No strings attached, this is a very basic north indian restaurant with no extravagant ambiance. Place is clean enough and hygiene is maintained for you to enjoy your meal without worrying about anything. It reminds everyone of Punjabi's being loud and happy go lucky, quirky punjabi posters on the restaurant walls take your memory to dhabas in punjab.  Your craving for authentic Delhi / Punjab type parathas will add here, take your dip in white butter and go for the kill. I had Aloo pyaaz paratha, gobhi paratha, paneer paratha, they all are big in size and taste amazing. I could compare it to best parathas I have had in Delhi. Filling is nice and you could feel the taste of masalas in the filling nicely. Choley bhaturey pindi is the best in Bangalore, choley beats the highly famed choley bhaturey in Delhi like Rama choley bhaturey, monica choley bhaturey etc. Kachori aloo is more like bedmi poori with aloo, can be given a miss if you are looking for authentic crispy kachori, though it tastes nice, aloo is super tasty. I have also had dal tadka with roti and it taste as authentic as home cooked dal in punjabi homes.  Service gets a little slow as the place gets super packed, but the staff tries to keep pace with it. Guys at the counter are very friendly and checks for feedback. Overall a no frills attached place to go for excellent north indian food. Go for it even if you stay far, would never regret it. Hit it for Sunday breakfast, parathas, and lassi and chaas, simply mind blowing."
4.0,"Perfect place for north Indian and Punjabi food. Love the butter milk here. Ambience is kind off a dhaba with normal seatings, but Is nice to hangout with family and friends. For starters we had cheese balls which were super yum, a must dish to order to here if you love spicy food. Going towards main course we had palak panner,dhabe wali daal and phulka which were equally delicious. A small, cute and cozy place to visit with family and friends."
4.0,"Liked the Punjabi food here. Went for new year, the waiters were professional and courteous, I liked the food but a butter over dose, can't blame, it's Punjabi. My friends who were Punjabi food lovers felt it was heaven. Liked the place,UST visit for authentic Punjabi food lovers"
4.5,"This is like 'cant go wrong' kinda food joint, which always stands up to our expectation. Authentic veg food and reasonable pricing . we keep ordering food from here from different delivering portals. However, just wanted to bring to your notice @teamzomato , twice we ordered food via zomato from kapoor's and the food tasted so different. Totally not like d actual kapoors cafe food. Just not sure, coincidentally happened for only those two days wen we ordered via zomato."
4.5,"A ready to go place , always! Awesome food, great service ! Food is made there with the love that only comes from Punjab. The oozing butter on the parathas, the spices in the curries and the sweetness of the lassi - one of the best combinations for any meal of the day!"
5.0,The food is a total bliss. Ordered the winter special thali with sarso ka saag and makki ki roti which was cooked nicely and was tasty. The parathas with white butter are cooked to perfection. The lassi is a must try. Icing on the cake - shahi tukda was toooo good. The service is super quick and polite. Total bill for three was around 700/-
2.0,"Had ordered paneer butter masala and shahi paneer. Although the shahi paneer was ok, but the paneer butter masala was a total disappointment. Have stayed for quite some time in delhi so know the taste of it. Also in terms of price, taste and quality i think chula chowki da dhaba is better."
4.5,"Heard a lot about this place , so decided to give it a shot. This place is very easy to locate on Google maps, so no issues getting here from electronic city.  The decor resembles a dhaba and the Punjabi music playing (Daler mehndi and others) sets the rustic feel and a captivating atmosphere. The interiors are good and the staff is attentive , courteous and responsive. Kudos for that.  I ordered a butter milk and a  Sarso ka saag combo to start with and ended with a Lassi.  The butter milk was the show stealer. It had the perfect flavour of rock salt and jeera in it  and  the presentation in a kullad(a cup made of mud) was a nice touch. This is for sure bang for the buck.  The Sarso ka saag combo comes with Sarso ka saag, makke di roti, a generous dallop of butter, a piece of jaggery, salad and green chutney. The Sarso ka saag , 2 makke ki roti ,jaggery and butter form a formidable combo with amazing taste, which you would crave even after leaving this place. The saag had an earthy flavour indicating ,that it had been cooked in earthen pot, which seemed even more desi. The only culprit here was price. For 260 bucks this combo seemed a bit pricey, but taste made for it.  Finally, on Lassi, which again served in earthen cup amazed me, the sweetness was right and balanced ,Kesar drops on top added a nice touch.  Overall an amazing experience . Must try in Bangalore.  Taste 5.0 Ambiance 5.0 Location ( please open a branch in electronic city) Value for money 4.0 (may seem a bit expensive, but the taste makes up for it)."
1.0,Combos are not good. I didn't like the jira aloo and curry was too chilly for me. Lassi chaas etc are good. But they are overpriced.
4.0,"Search for a Veg restaurant near Hoodi took us here which was largely influenced by zomato ratings but it was worth it..this place is inside the gurukul sports academy compound which is one of the oldest badminton courts in that area..We went on a sunday afternoon & there was lot of rush & we got the table in half an hr time.. The place is not very big but decent enough & gives a feel of the dhaba with continous Punjabi tracks giving you a feel of north india..  We though general food will take time so we ordered assorted food pakodas to start off.. It came in almost no time. has mix of two types of pakodas i.e Paneer pakoda & Onion pakoda.. It was little oily but taste was good. Then we ordered cheese balls which was little spicy and the red chilli chatni was even making it more spicier..We also ordered aloo partha, mix paratha, paneer paratha and makke di roti sarso da saag combo..we liked the parathas but sarso d saag combo was not at all good..Although the presentation was good with jaggery etc and was looking really nice but the taste was not good..Killer is their dry fruit sweet lassi and one must have it..  The service is really fast .. rates are really affordable & worth it.. Overall a good place if you are looking out for North indian options in veg.."
4.0,"The parathas are yummy especially Aloo paratha and 1 plate is enough for a person. Can try Veg combo too. They have completely concentrated on the quality of rather than spending loads on ambiance than improving the taste. So if you have good food with your friends in a reasonable price, Kapoor's is the place."
4.0,"Typical punjabi north Indian food, lassi and chhas are top class. Exteriors are ordinary but have patience, its decent inside, crowded but comfy. This is more of a food place than ambiance. Not very reasonably priced but not expensive either. Food is good, we tried Lassi, chhas, Sarso saag and makke di roti, Dhabe wali daal, Kadai paneer (its spicy) etc and all were good. Very close to Varthur/HAL road, look for signboard which doesnt stand out :-)"
3.0,"Update 17/07/2017 The prices have gone up after gst, like stock market after demonetization. The food is ok for the price.                          - Veg curries are good, and they add extra masala - Parathas are also goodand are served with quarter packet butter serving.  Overall experience was OK. Its good for people who like hot and spicy food. I felt that menu is a bit overpriced for the ambiance and service."
5.0,"Chilly winters and hot paranthas for breakfast! Heavenly combination. Though you never get to see that cold winters in Bangalore but how about paranthas? Hot stuffed paranthas with a dollop of butter, like Delhi on your plate! Or for that matter Chole Bhature, Butter Naan and Creamy Dal Makhani. This review won't be complete if I don't mention their Famous Sweet Lassi, thick creamy lassi which has to be eaten (yes you read it right!) is mind blowing. I so wish they had a non vegetarian section!"
3.5,"This was my first visit to Kapoor's cafe. After checking 4-star reviews on zomato, I decided to try here. The review of food which i felt not up to the mark, Veg Kolhapuri - only spicy no taste at all, Dal Makhani - taste like simple dal, Plain paratha - very thick. I had a lot of expectation after seeing such a good review but it was really disappointing after having such food. The ambiance is very simple (no AC). If you are expecting posh restaurant then this is not for you. They serve in steel plates and I found it was not clean properly with alot of scratches looks like very old plates. Ratings Food - 3/5 Ambiance - 2.5/5 Service - 3/5"
4.0,It's second visit to Kapoor's and never say no for parota feeling. Also parota with butter is heavenly. Roti with paneer butter masala was added one.
3.5,The place is good . Stands out amongst the big brothers of the city...  The food here is good.  The lassi is a class apart... The location is perfect.. amidst the residential loaclity and close to the bandminton club . Perfect recipie is ..Go for a game of bandminton or an hour of swimming and have a tummy full of pure North Indian delicacy..
3.5,Good place to have spicy authentic Punjabi veg cuisine .Ambience is not up to the mark .Food tastes good.You need to book your table before hand as it's always crowded specially on weekends .
4.0,"I live in Bsk 2nd Stage and it took me nearly 1.5 hours to reach there thanks to Traffic at Silk Board but it was totally worth the wait. Ordered Sarso Da Saag Combo, Lassi, Aloo Paratha, Paneer Degchi Delliwale, Khasta Paratha and another Lassi as it was soooo Good. The ambience was good too and the service was  commendable for the rush they handle. Waiting for a chance to go there again."
4.5,Great dhaba style place. Good reasonable vegetarian fare. Punjabi style masala fries. Pataka cheese balls. Dry fruit lassi. Paneer lababdar. Baigan bharta. Paneer paratha. Khasta paratha. All very good. The only thing we didn't like was aloo pyaaz pakoda. Masala soda also good. Warning the paratha came with a huge blob of butter. The only thing is that they don't serve food. Which wasn't a deal breaker but.... Overall must visit... different place in bangalore.
1.0,"Uche Dukaan Pheka Pakwan! This is what i can rate this restaurant. After very high expectation i went there but turnout to be road side Dhaba. Cleanness, Sitting and ambiance at every department the restaurant is poor. Just don't go with expectation that the food will be like typical North Indian Food. May be the guys living in Bengaluru like their parantha etc but it is no way close to a good parantha. Rayta they serve with Parantha is pathetic. Their only TRP is that they give half Amul Butter brick with each parantha to fool public :)"
4.5,You can go here n number of times.. They serve real good Punjabi food.. The lassi here is my favorite after triple layer cheese paratha.. Whenever hungry and feel like having spicy food I prefer this place over anything
4.0,"Not much variety , but really tasty stuff! Have been here a couple of times for dinners and I would say that i just love their aaloo parathas along with white butter (you will love it too! ). Ambiance wise don't expect much as its a small place converted to restaurant. Other recommendations from the main course would be Paneer degchi . Service is really good as its managed by the humble owners themselves. Overall I would suggest that just step in if you want to enjoy Punjab food. Its value for money considering the parathas :P"
5.0,"Hmm..where to start. It was a lazy saturday noon, we reached the so-hyped kapoor cafe. To be frank, I was a bit taken aback by the first look (you know we judge things based on looks so much). Plus were handed over a chit with waiting # 16. But after around 5 minutes we entered the place and boy it was noisy !! Have been to many highway dhaba and the scene was identical. Coming to the food, we ordered Bread-Paneer Pakoda, pindi chole bhature, makki roti and sarso saag combo, paneer paratha and lassi. With the first bite of each dish, I was pleasantly shocked, as everything was just ""out of the world"". If you close your eyes you won't believe that you are not sitting in a delhi/punjab road-side dhaba. I always heard food can taste divine, today I felt it. Everything was cooked to perfection and served with a generous amount of butter. Service was quick and effective given the chaos and sheer volume. Taste 6/5 (I mean it). If you are a northie longing for the back home taste , skip you office (if required) and go here."
4.0,"This is the best place for good punjabi food in whitefield. Been here many times just for their parathas and the fact that this place is pocket friendly. If u don't mind standing in a line for at least an hour on weekends/ Friday night then this is the best place. It's always bustling with people so don't expect any cozy ambience.   Over the time the service has become little lousy otherwise the taste of the food is top notch.  Had tried 6 cheese paratha after seeing many reviewers talk about it. But seriously it wasn't up to the mark. Only one kind of cheese was used and the amount of cheese was also not up to the expectation.  Don't go for any fancy items nor the paneer paratha here, just order the regulars and get your mind blown.  PS : no food pics attached as I couldn't take resist eating before even thinking of taking pic :p   Ambience -3/5  Taste - 4.5/5 Service and food presentation - 3/5  Value for money - 4.5/5"
1.0,"Ohhh Rating 1.0 but I dont have anything below that..They mention truly Punjabi food...HAHA. I recommended to team in office and not only my team others also joined for Lunch on 21st Dec. The food was worst I ever had. Saag was sour ..the owner told me Saag actual tastes like this. He was thinking I am having it first time in Life whereas in my native in a season we eat Saag atleast twice in a week, come-on Man dont fool us.  Another item Paneer Butter Masala which was just Panner dipped in tomato Puree , We ordered 4 and wasted as owner does not accept that there is a mistake. Place is not so clean now a days as it was before.  Ratings: Food : 1/5 Ambience : 1/5 Service : 1/5 Quality : 1/5  Their attitude have changed a lot..Money minded. I felt ashamed in front of all colleagues. Will have to thing before visiting again."
3.5,"This review is only for the sarsoo Da saag and maakai di roti. Saag was amazing with right amount of Makhan and meethi tadka. The only thing which felt missing was garlic. It's my personal choice but little bit would have enhanced the taste. Maakai roti was good and was cooked perfect but ghee usage was less  Quality : 3.5/5 Value for money : saag(4/5),roti 3/5"
1.0,Tasteless food now a days. A classic example of commercialisation. Now nothing is good here. The super tasty baigan bharta and kadhai paneer are all gone. All but a tasteless restaurant is left.
2.0,I liked the cafe. Food is average.  Ambience is very ok. One time can be tried. Too Low rating is because overrated food. Specifically Lassi and kheer.
5.0,"This is the best cafe to go and have delhi style food. Pindi chole bhature are finger licking, dhabe ki dal, combos are awesome.Service is fast,always have to wait for 5-10min to get a table because of their popularity. Super food and I'm going to this cafe from past 3-4 weeks and would still continue to go! A must go please. :)"
5.0,Not the one for words ! My first review on Zomato. Had to write one for this place. The food here is class apart. Without doubt one it is the best places in bangalore for authentic Punjabi Food. The ambience and music make the experience perfect.I would rate it a perfect 5 star on the value for money quotient.  P.S. Khasta Paratha and Kalmiri Sticks are the must have dishes here.
1.5,Management has changed their attitude towards customers post good business I guess. Totally overhyped leaving us dissatisfied.  The place looks untidy and low maintained. The food was average and also had a bad stomach following the dinner.  They don't accept sodexos coupons anymore whereas they did before when questioned they said there is no profit on that and they purely think of business. Looks like money is the only motive now to them.
4.0,"Naan, Roti items are much special here, Little bit costly but quality and tasty north indian foods with good taste. Can enjoy your treats and special party here if you are north indian food lover,. Finishing touch"" POT LASSI with fully Filled sliced BADAMS"" simply awesome. worth for money."
4.0,"""One visit is definitely recommended""  Service is prompt..  Food  is delicious ..  Lassi is must...  Parathas and phulkas are must try...  Ambience makes u feel good..."
4.0,A perfect place to have north Indian cuisine.They serve all kinds of parathas you would have heard of.One stuffed paratha is enough to fill your belly.They put a lot of butter on parathas n gravies which enhances t test and make you remember your home cooked food.The ambiance is good at this outlet.The service is also fast and good.Recommended to try.
4.5,"Unhealthy but extremely tasty!  The parathas here are served with so much butter that you can swim in the butter once it melts!  Haha. Jokes apart, but the parathas are exceptional! As is their Lassi. However the ITPL branch has way better lassi. This branch has marginally better starters and main course.  PRO TIP: order cheese pataka balls and ask them to make it extra spicy."
4.0,"This is by far the best North Indian restaurant I have come across in Bangalore. Not the typical dhaba food as you would expect but it is close enough to excite you. Their daal and parathas are very good. Real desi lassi, soft paneer and whole wheat parathas give you a nostalgic feeling.  #Food : 4.5 #Service : 4 #Ambiance : 3.5 #Value for Money : 4 (bit costly)"
4.5,Awesome parathas. They put like butter enough for 3 parathas on one. Lassi is awesome. Loved it. Went their thrice on consecutive days. Punjabis will love it.
2.0,Not sure about dining but home delivery experience was pathetic. They serve minimal chutney (not sufficient even for 1 paratha) for 5 parathas. Also the salad was stale. The white rice kheer was ok but nothing special as compared to the price at which it was offered.
3.0,"I loved the food, it was bit spicy. Best place to have punjabi dishes and they do have jain style cooking if you ask for it. It was kind of noisy in there and its hard to listen to the music. The place looks cheap and has a shack like feel. There is parking options but its very dusty outside. The place is hard to spot from main road, especially in the daylight, because of less conspicuous sign board. Is it worth the money? Well, its about the experiencing Punjabi food, other than that its just loud and you almost end up paying the same that you might spend in a descent family restaurant.                                                                 sreeragnk.com"
4.5,Omg Omg.... Who says veg food can't be delicious?visit Kapoor's Cafe and I am 100% sure you will change your mind. I had one of the best lassi and panner naan of my entire life. One must definitely give this place a try. The food is every bit worth the bucks. Loved it.
5.0,"Great quality food,great ambiance ..most of the time i went here in weekend as this is opposite to my PG :) and i love their all dishes specially dry fruit lassi and paneer parathas . The location of the restaurant is also very good .whenever you will visit you can expect a crowd and i guess thats enough to describe how good this restaurant is."
3.5,It's a small hut like cafe restaurant with good and tasty food. Ambience can be made better. Value for money. Must visit once. Must try lassi.
4.5,"Makke di roti sarso da saag....the punjabi crave is fully satisfied with this dhaba. The place is makeshift but nice and clean. Food is authentic and aromatic. Young crowd , great punjabi lyrics and yummy spread...a must visit place for parathas and chole.."
4.5,"Not a place for a romantic kinda  dinner but something really worth to hang out with friends. Lively funjabi music, courteous staff, good service and ultimately awesome food."
4.0,"Have visited this place 2-3 times in last month and overall experience has been good. Restaurant only serves veg food. Have tried Aloo Puri, Kachori Aloo , Dry fruit lassi during first visit and in the next visit, we had ordered Lassi, Paneer Lababdar and assorted bread. Authentic punjabi good with curries having lot of oil. :). Paneer was awesome and my daughter loved it.  Price seems to be a bit on higher side considering the overall dining experience ( no a/c, regular sitting arrangement).  would definitely visit again to try parathas combos.  Items recommended: Lassi, Kachori Aloo"
4.5,"Yummy Yummier and Yummiest food, specially the parathas are mouth watering topped with loads of Butter. The thali was just like home food. Staff is very cordial. Ambience is also okay."
4.5,Awesome north indian food... Had parathas...paneer ...alu sabzi... Sweets...evrything was delicious.. Loved the khuhad kheer... Service was very quick...and staff was polite..
4.0,"Combo review: This is my second visit to this place and I opted for having a thali since I visited during lunch. We were two people so we chose a rajma combo and a kadhai paneer combo. The combo included 3 phulka, rice, aloo ki sabji, Bondi ka raita, salad, masala papad and you can choose rajma or kadhai paneer or Various other options like dal makhni etc. The rajma and kadhai paneer was mouth watering. Spicy and delicious. I loved the aloo ki sabji and the raita as well. Service was also very prompt. I completely loved this experience.  I loved this place for the lassi they serve. It's amazing. Apart from that we had rajma chawal nan and paneer gravy dishes. Food tastes good and were spicy as well. For starters we took pakodas and French fries with an Indian twist. Service is also good. The only suggestion would be to make this place air conditioned because the place gets really crowded and the price which they take for the dishes it's at par for an air conditioned place."
4.5,Had been to this place quite some time back with my friends but i still remember the good food I had and is worth mentioning about. Would recommend for a full on meal.
4.0,Had a very nice breakfast in kapoors cafe its just amazing ambience casual but grand also menu price very affordable any body wana try some changes in breakfast can try there.Good
4.0,Interesting place. With Decor and service they try to create of Feel of Punjab in Bangalore.Taste is very close to what you can expect. Must visit Place.
1.5,Not a vegetarian so it took me some time to end up here. I have always been hearing a lot of good things about this place.  But clearly they were all overhyped. We picked the two best(read 'costliest') starters but ended up being dissapointed. The lassi was good but there was nothing special about it and there was hardly any taste in the parathas. Adding a heapload of butter on your parathas dont change their mediocre taste. Neither does useless chatter with customers make your restaurant more likeable.  The ambience is decent despite the cheap furniture and arrangement. The food is pretty ordinary but quite overpriced. You can try this place once but i dont find anything to pull me to this place again. For every item that they serve there are a lot many better options available in the city.
4.0,Kapoor cafe have 2 outlets in Bangalore and this one is the 1st one which is situated near to kundanhalli gate n the other one is at itpl.as I have already reviewed  the other outlet n loved the food n even this outlet is having same to same taste n all in menus.if I will compare between two then I will prefer the other one only bcoz of little better ambiance and little quick service.fooood wise always superb n same in both.go for it
4.0,"Great place for all vegetarian people who like North Indian cuisines, specially Punjabi Dhabe da khana! The smell of all the good food is a bliss. Forget your worries and just enjoy the food that will be served to you.  We ordered phulkes, dal tarka, baingan bharta and Kapoor's Cafe Special mix paratha with lassi.  Boy, it was worth the wait.  Nothing much to say about the place. You need to visit this place if you love Punjabi khana."
4.5,"Neither does it glitter from the outside, nor from the inside! But the ambience was all about the fantastic 90s and 2000s Punjabi gaane Playlist that played endlessly to my joy, pouring memories from my childhood. So, ambience = 4.7/5  We ordered Pindi Chole Bhature and a Gobi Parantha. The menu claimed it was Dilli style, and well.. 'twas good, but not entirely like the ones I've had in Delhi! But they did come close, and that's appreciatiable. Not the best, but one of the better ones. Gobi parantha came with overloaded butter on top. It was great. So, food = 4.5/5  Service was decent, as much as required. Service = 4.6/5  Overall, a great experience! 4.6/10"
3.0,"Brief - Overrated, okay food, slightly on the expensive side, too cramped and noisy I've been here a few times for dinner, as it is very close to my home. I'd heard a lot about it, as THE place to go to for Punjabi food. However, I find the flavour of the food to be only okay. There is nothing wrong with it, but there is nothing great about it either. Whether it is the dals, the paneer or other curries. The place itself is set a little away from the road, inside a compound (very easy to miss.) Once you are inside, it is very noisy and extremely cramped. Waiters and other patrons will keep bumping into your chair as they move around. Service is reasonably quick, but getting the waiter's attention can sometimes be a challenge. For the price, it is definitely not value for money since everything else - taste, service, ambience - is either okay or somewhat disappointing.  Verdict: Go here if you are in the area and want Punjabi food, but don't expect too much."
3.0,Wont say typical punjabi food but yea pretty close. The stock chole bhature not as gud as what one might get in old delhi but they have tried their level best. Not a very wise pick if ur planning on being lean n slim.
3.5,"Ordered dal & paneer do pyaaza. No issues with service. Pricing is higher for curries, tastes good. Chana dal was properly cooked - flavoursome. Paneer was soft, a bit oily - thick gravy.   Went today for dine in, there was a waiting of 15 minutes. Sarson ka saag combo (Ok), dal makhani (good), khasta parantha (nice). Masala papad - good quantity of chopped onion N tomato with lime."
4.5,"Pure punjabi food! All north indians who crave north indian food, this is the place to hit! The dal makhani and the paneer will take you to an other place. CHEESE BURST PARATHAS, yes you read that right. Cheese lovers, this exists and you have to give it a try. The lassi was out of this world as well. The service was fast and the food was delicious."
4.0,"Nice place to have authentic punjabi food . I went to this resturent first time with lots of hope . The food was excellent taste . Ordered paratha , lassi , chass , thali . All the food taste was superb . The owner and staff are gentle and nice . They asked feedback for improvement of any dish they served . I recommend  friends to go and enjoy really tasty food ."
4.0,"Visited the place on Diwali day, the place was very crowded but the staff was courteous enough to help us find a seat for two. I could see the staff running about to keep pretty much every one happy. We ordered the dry fruit lassi, masala chaas and parathas. The staff reminded us that the qty of parathas might be too much for us and suggested ordering half of want we ordered and order again if required. Very thoughtful of the staff as we were visiting the place for the first time. The food was very delicious especially the parathas which were served with a large dollop of ghee! Definetly recommended for authentic punjabi food!"
3.0,"I feel this place is a bit overrated. I have been wanting to visit this place since some time after reading raves on Zomato, but the place did not live up to the hype.  First of all, it is more of a dhaba (a little more elegant maybe) than a caf. The place is located little inside the main road where you would not imagine it to be. It is an area where you might find a garage kind of a place, but its good that there is sufficient parking. The place has a rural touch. The Punjabi culture phrases on the walls make it very interesting; I especially enjoyed reading the fun facts about punjabis more so because being a Punjabi I could relate to most of these. So ambience wise it is a decent Punjabi place to be in.  But I was disappointed with the food which was way too spicy and oily than it should have been. I know Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich gravies and flavor, but this one was low on flavor and it was just too oily and a lot spicy taking it to the unhealthy side. The alloo jeera in my thali was undercooked and the butter paneer masala was just high on masalas. The green chutney was watery. Alloo parantha was a little better in that sense, with good and proper filling but I felt if you are serving one parantha in the range of Rs 50-100, it better come with curd at least or we should get an option of getting curd instead of butter.  I have been to a lot better Punjabi restaurants in Bangalore serving authentic food and at lower prices than this one, but seems like there is a dearth of such places in this area which is why this one is thriving!"
4.0,This would be one of the closest to a dhaba all the way south in Bangalore. The mishti dahi was heavenly and so was the poori chole. The food is true value for money and the taste has an authentic feel to it. The seating is at best casual but the service and smiling staff make the place pleasant.
4.5,"Delicious Punjabi food. Loved the food, simple ambience, background old Punjabi pop songs and aloo de paranthe.  It is definitely nice North Indian place in Bangalore.  We ordered aloo parantha, gobi parantha, khasta parantha, all tasted so good. They serve it in Punjabi style with lots of butter :P Being an ardent fan of Punjabi food we ordered kadhi pakoda and rice also. But it was a slight disappointment, can be improved.  For desert we ordered fruit cream, it was too good and lassi was mindblowingly great. Overall it was a fun evening eating awesome food and listening to old Punjabi daler mahendi songs :)  Watch out though.. on weekends there is a significant wait time of 30-40 mins."
4.0,Ordered kadhai paneer and rotis from here.  The paneer was awesome. Really spicy and hot. I have had this dish before in a different kapoor's cafe but this was way better. I will definitely be ordering from here again. One dish was barely enough for one eater.
2.0,"The place has nothing to flaunt for, no good food and worst ambience and infrastructure. And its overrated and highly priced. They should atleast improve the food quality."
4.5,"Perfect place to taste some good and spicy north Indian food. Ambience adds flavor to it. I feel it is little over priced but worth going if you are a fan Punjabi food. You will get good burps after having food here. Buttermilk and lassi are worth trying..really like the way they serve it in ""Kulhad""."
3.5,Authentic Punjabi restaurant. it has come up with a new outlet which is great as this is always overcrowded. Must try cheese pataka balls for starters.
5.0,This is an awesome place to hang out. Foods are delicious and available in awesomely low prices.  Ambience is not too great but who cares when u get such food!! Lassi is must try here.
4.5,"Wow.. went there today for the third time with a bunch of friends for breakfast... if you are a vegetarian and  punjabi food, than this is a place you must visit. Even non vegetarian would love it. Where to start, we ordered like we had not eaten for days.  -aloo Partha , paneer paratha, gobi , onion , cheese burst, punjabi French fries, cheese ball, chole batura, lassi, butter milk kachori... everything was awesome. Loved the lassi , chole Batuta and cheese paratha..  Previous experience  At last was able to go to this place. A great punjabi restaurant . Best part is it is veg.. loved the food , the parathas were awesome just loved it. In case you are not a fan of butter , do let the waiters know that you donot want butter or else the parathas will drip in butter. Loved the lassi.. they have a nice system of paying the bill where you have to go to the cashier to pay, he will read the bill and you pay. I felt it gave it more of a human touch. the only thing that I thought could be better was the seating."
5.0,"Visited the place thrice and never got disappointed.Ambiance is not that great, but you will definitely fall in love with the food.Dhaba style with authentic punjabi taste.Highly overcrowded....Kheer must try!!!!"
4.0,"Kapoor's Cafe  It was a authentic Punjabi cuisine with local Desi infrastructure. Didn't expect the crowd, yet it was weekend crowd was much.  Menu has Complete punjabi items like breakfast and meal.  Ordered one Combo meal, Gobi Parata, Dry fruit Lassi, Pepsi Masala soda and Assorted starter.  Everthing was on time, Hot served.  Combo was something intresting with all types of items in the plate.  Dry fruit Lassi was so tasty."
3.5,"Nice plaxe for breakfast or brunch. Good desi veg punjabi food. Lassi, aloo paratha, chole, dal puris were good. paneer pakora, kheer, bhatura were average. Music system should be improved as we could hardly hear the songs. Light on the pocket and clean as well. Worth atleast a visit."
1.0,ordered food for home delivery paneer do payaza mushroom masala n few parathas... to be honest parsthas was the only thing which was edible.. there was ton of oil dripping down from the box which had to be seprated out. curries had way too much masala... on the whole shitty food not recommended.
4.5,Being a North indian I was searching for dhaba style food in Bangalore and then Kapoors Cafe came to the rescue. I ordered many dishes. Really loved the parathas and lassi but i was disappointed with Matra Kulcha. Matra was undercooked and watery. Will surely want to revisit this place specially for the stuffed parathas.
4.0,If you do not know the place and visiting for the 1st time just follow the map or you will be lost..the entrance looks like you are at a dhaba but the ambience is decent...lassi served in a matka with flavour of kesar must have...the best cheese pakodas..mutter paratha was a bit spicy n so filling...kadai paneer was good...the oaneer pulav was a bit oily...heard the fruit Cream is the best desert but we tried the shahi tukda instead and it was good with little less sweet..on yhw whole a good experience
4.5,"If you want to have a dhaba kinda taste and without much driving, here's the place within city limits. The only difference you would find from regular dhabas is this place doesn't remain open after 11pm.  Located in a small lane after varthur itpl signal with no roads and a deserted parking.  Simple table chair seating arrangement. Clean hygienic place, neat kitchen. What else you need from a dhaba like place. Let's talk about food - delicious food, nice portions, served hot. And the best part is it is PURE VEG. Way to go VEGANs. Cheese pakoda balls are simply finger licking. French Fries Punjabi style are truly Funjabi. Added falvors like chat masala and chilli powder, decorated with fried green chillies. Masala papad is also very tasty though papad is very tiny in size. Pudina khasta paratha is good. Aloo Paratha (with butter, Punjabi portion) rocks. Chilli Onion paratha is the only disappointing dish we had. Fulkas are good. Malai kofta, rajma and paneer lababdar - tasty and delicious. Though would advise to have spicy paneer like butter masala or kadai paneer. Jeera rice is usual. Buttermilk is tasty. Lassi rocks, deserves for repeat order. Dry fruit lassi is very subjective as it contains too much of cashews and almonds. Sometime bit slow in service, but mostly prompt service. That may be the only reason for no to 5* rating.Priyanka Jain"
1.0,"The most over-hyped restaurant in Whitefield. Really poor food quality...they're not capable of handling the huge influx of crowd usually seen during weekends. The whole place stinks of fat Punjabi dudes sweating and salivating...with one eye on the ""Soni kudi"" waiting outside and other eye on their mobile phone...while loudly reciting the menu card...it's like Navjot Singh Siddhu x 100 .  The owner, like any other Punjabi guy...hardly cares about the mismanaged situation ...and has a very casual approach to any situation ( Saw some dudes fighting outside...and when informed about it...the owner just said ""O jee...unko keh do thand rakho"" )   Coming to the food...It's unbelievable how one can't get even a Masala papad right....One KG of masala dumped on a poor Papad....And so tangy and sour...That one wishes they shud have ordered a plain papad :( The rest of the food like gravy items and roti are just about average. If Punjabi's can make Honey Singh a superstar...Then no wonder they can make Kapoors Cafe so famous !"
4.0,"Authentic Punjabi parantha, taste, spices, ambience and kind of flavours used. If you are looking for punjabi parantha, Veg north indian food this is the best place in and around Whitefield. A must visit place and bit crowded during weekends. It is recommened to come bit early to avoid rush. We ordered almost all types of paranthas - alu, gobhi, mix, khasta, Cheese, cheese burst and paneer. Cheese parantha is a must try as you will not find it easily in another places. Do try matka Lassi with added kesar."
2.0,"I have been here for first time with high expectations after reading reviews. To start with good i liked lassi and khasta paratha, though lassi was too sweet by any standard. We ordered Paneer butter masala with no butter/ cream and almost tasteless; worst was the dhaba daal, which was stale and smelly. Also the place is too noisy, if you want a peaceful eve. So overall my experience with the place has been very bad for the first time."
4.5,If you love authentic Punjabi food then this is the place for you. Awesome rajma and cheese paratha. Great ambience. Friendly staff and Punjabi songs. A must go place.
4.0,"Bang on spot for authentic Punjabi food. My roommate and I head on to Kapoor's whenever we have the sudden urge to have aloo paratha. Their aloo pyaaz paratta is brilliant with generous serving of butter. We have also tried their khasta paratha, paneer paratha, three cheese paratha, phulka with desi ghee, pindi Chole, chaas, lassi..  Personal favorite : aloo pyaaz paratha and chaas. Always.  The only drawback I see is that the place shuts at 3pm and then opens up at 7pm. It would be amazing if the place is open throughout the day.   VFM : 4.5/5 Hygiene: 4/5 Food Quality : 4/5 Food Quantity : 4/5"
5.0,Awesome food and awesome service. I am definitely their permanent customer when it comes to punjabi food. Would recommend this place to anyone.
4.0,Awesome!! Chaa gaye ji tusi!! Tu-adey nal parathe kha kar man changa ho gaya ji!! Jabardasht!! North Indian parathe da experience for first time in Bangalore. Great to have your outlet near my residence!! Chaa gaye ji tusi chaa gaye!! Shukriya hai ji!!
3.5,"Being a punjabi, and a foodie, life was difficult in Bangalore until I came across Kapoor's Cafe. The place reeked of punjab! The place is built in a shed kind of a place with flowers and plants. It reminded me of a garden seating. The hosts and servers were warm and accomodating. Seating was not particularly comfortable though. But the place looked good overall. Initially the food stole my heart. But with time their quality has degraded, the service has worsened and the taste has disappeared. The food that once tasted amazing now leaves a horrible after taste in mouth. The lassi and chhaach both still remain spot on. The Aloo Parantha is almost drool worthy! The cheese balls though are downright disasters. They are extremely sour for no good reason and I puked The last time I had them. The mozzarella parantha was calorie laden but worth it. Shahi tukda is something they can strike off their menu.  I would recommend this place as a one time trial thing if you are looking for sort of punjabi food in Bangalore!"
3.0,Small place and comfortable. Taste is good but in every items we ordered they provided panner. Probably waiter should mention that you are ordering panner in all items. Best is Kadi item along with Lassi.
1.0,I ordered  food today through swiggy order no 1069121976. Ordered 3 khasta parathas jeera rice shai paneer and dhabha dal. The food was really disappointing. Paneer was soacked in oil parathas were raw on sides   dal was watery and rice was of bad quality small and sticky. I doubt if the food really came from the restaurant . I am in brookfield. Requesting management to check the order.  There was no branding on the food continers and no printed bill was provided.  Yhe good was delayed as well. The delivery person said the delay was from restaurant.
4.5,What a paratha n buttermilk.If u wanna revive a taste of punjab then do visit here.Amazing food n service.It has a simple ambiemce like some punjabi dhabha but its feels great to ve food there.
4.0,"One of my Favorite places in Bangalore. Well known for Hot Hot Paratha's , Pakoda's ,Lassi and many more Punjabi Dishes. A small Dhaba kind of Place with yummy food, reasonable  price and amazing Music to energize your mood. It's Best Authentic Punjabi tastes makes it one of the must visit places in Whitefield.  I would always love to visit this place again and again , and would suggest anyone to pay a visit ..:) Trust me its worth it..!!  Food: 4/5 Ambience : 4/5 Service: 4/5"
3.5,"Generally a crowded place on weekends So if u are thinking to ho on a date ,u should plan something else Cant say 100authentic Punjabi food  but somewhat nearer to that  Must try sweet lassi here they will serve in small matkas We had 1 paratha thalli and lassi Paratha is full of butter and ghee U cant have it more than 1 Must try once Totally worth it!"
5.0,"Superb Punjabi food!! The best in Bangalore!! Great parathas, chhole!! The Punjabi masala fries and kalami Punjabi sticks are quite amazing! overall a great experience."
1.0,The food was toooooo spicy & oily. Was looking like I m eating spices rather than veg. Pathetic food & high cost. Will never order again.... It shud be renamed as spice's cafe
4.5,We ordered the kadai mushroom for home delivery which was really good. Id like to visit this place to have another proper meal here. Just wish they served non vegetarian food as well :)
4.5,"CHEESE BURST PARATHA/LASSI. MUST TRY.  The place makes you wonder from the outside and also while you wait for the food with the basic cutlery but all the doubts are squished when the food comes. Perfect place to have North Indian food here in Bangalore. It has a board saying "" Punjab 0km"" . Certainly feels like it. Daal makhani is awesome. One piece of advice- ask for less butter with the paranthas. Even my grandma doesn't put that much butter in my food. The menu is beautifully designed. I always end up over eating here."
4.0,"Decent ambience and basic cutlery, but mind it very tasty food. Went for a lazy Sunday brunch and was totally satisfied with the food. Loved the parathas n chole. Must try buttermilk n lassi.  They charge a lil extra for sides like curd and stuff. But overall a nice place specially for veggies n perfect for a heavy tasty brunch."
4.5,"When you look at it from outside , you might wonder what got you there.  Once you step in, you'll know what a treat you are up for.  Food : 4.5  We went in for different combo meals and man it was yummy! Not to forget the French fries with a tinge of spice on top stole the show for me. I loved the Shahi Paneer and the kheer that was served in the combo. The rice was grainy and not pulav like. Tasted more like fried rice.  Pricing : A little over priced. 450 for a thali is as good as a buffet price.  Ambience : Again, gives you the typical Punjabi dhaba feeling with all Punjabi quotes around. Quite airy and though it is always full , it doesn't get to you.  Service : Very good.  If you are in for a hardcore Punjabi meal, do give this place a visit!"
1.0,"Been there for a dinner after seeing good rating and was really surprised. Very dirty and messy place, plates were dirty. Too much red chilly powder used in the curries, gravy was just awful. Paratha uncooked,  Lassi was just curd plus sugar. Price was at least double of any other restuarant of this grade.  Other than this I liked everything about this place"
3.5,"Visit this place between 12 to 12.30 pm for brunch or early lunch and only then you would be getting a table. We have already gone back once due to rush. Very crowded & crammed at peak eating times :)  Authentic Punjabi food. Started with their supacooling & light Chaas (buttermilk) served in matkas, flavoured with jeera (cumin seeds). It was Very soothing for us on this sunny day.  Starters: Paneer Pakoda: very average and bland but could balance the taste because of Pudina chutney served with it  Paranthas: Aaloo pyaaz: Try this only if you are an aaloo fan. Its good. Tastes well with dollup of butter melting on piping hot parantha  Mixed veg: Tasted good and much better than above one.   Must trys: Lassi (plain): very fresh, creamy and delicious ,served again in cooling earthern pot.  Fruit cream: Fresh cream with cashews and dried cherries, tastes heavenly.  Couldnt eat anything more after this order.. Very heavy and delicious Punjabi food that lets you out with a smile and happy tummy :)  Their billing concept looked very old fashioned. Need to pay at the counter where an uncle collects the amount and another person enters the details in their system. Keeping in mind the crowd waiting for tables, restricted space and slow billing, drives you crazy as this places gets rush-a-suffocating Please improvise this glitch. Rest all is good.   Important observation: Tipping is at the billing counter. Hope the servers get some amount outta this tip box, since they looked very young to serve at tables and feeble :("
4.5,"My search for Delhi style chola Bhatura took me to white field. Checked their menu on zomato beforehand for breakfast and went. Ordered Pindi Chola Bhatura and Dry fruit lassi, Pindi chola bhatura came, a huge steel thali with 2 large bhaturas and a generous helping of Pindi Chola and spiced potatoes. I was expecting slightly oval elongated shaped bhatura than the round bhatura. Was delighted to have Dilli wala taste after a long time soon followed by Dry fruit lassi, a small Matka with generous helping of almonds and a spoon, the lassi was good....now my search for Patiala Lassi continues... Since there were more items for breakfast, and 1 bhatura was quite filling, got kachori- Chole and kulcha- Chole parcelled.  The kachori was more like a small size puri with dal filling, like bedami puri. For lunch I kept the kachori in an OTG for 10 mins which spiked the flavour of the kachori. The waiter did goof up my order and I got bhatura instead of kulcha.  There were other items on menu which looked yummy, will return back for lunch/ dinner."
4.0,"I tried Chole bhatura here. They were the closest to the authentic ""Delhi style chole bhatura "" that I have tasted in this town. This place is economic and the seemed perfect to me for breakfast snacks."
1.0,Worst restaurant. Especially for bulk ordering.we had a corporate event. We order food from here. Very very bad food. Raita was watery. Starters no salt. Poor taste of sabji. Completely cheated by vendor. Think before you order bulk from here
4.0,It's THE BEST place for parathas!  And lassi ofcourse. Didn't try many things  because only one paratha is enough for your apetite. Alu paratha is classic but I had never eaten gobi paratha like that anywhere else! You won't regret the price (though it's a little high for one paratha) because you will be too much satisfied with the taste!
4.5,"If you are craving for the typical Punjabi rasoi food then this is the one and only place in Bengaluru which offers you the exact dishes, perfect flavor and teasers to the brains for the long gone memories...  Only weak point, desserts costly v/s the quantity served.   Must haves: Chole bhature Stuffed parathas Rice kheer"
3.0,"Location 3/5 Ambience 4/5 Food 3/5 Price 4/5 Service 3.5/5  Located on old airport road near Marathalli junction. Easy to locate and ample parking space. Can't book table on weekend and we had to wait for 20 min. Restaurant is inside a tin shade but well ventilated and beautifully decorated from inside.  We ordered masala 7up which was good but lassi wasnt great. Paneer Pakora also very average. Phulkas were not made well, disappointing. Dhabe ki daal, matar pander and veg kadahi were just average and a bit spicy. Aloo pyaz paratha was very good.  Service was a bit slow but received with smile. Price is fantastic and very light on pocket. Overall, it was a very average experience and I might not come again."
4.5,"Finally Visited this place one day for dinner. Earlier also I went to this place one Sunday for dinner. But it was some special Sunday and wait time was more than an hour. So skipped and went to some other restaurant. Such is the customer following of this place that you may not get table easily on weekend. Coming to food. It was pure punjabi food. Parathas, Kadai Paneer, lassi, dry fruit lassi everything was great. Only average thing was paneer pakoda, Everything was awesome. Must visit place for paratha lovers and people who like punjabi food."
5.0,"Oh wow! This little place had been on my wishlist since over a year now and I finally got a chance to have my lunch there. I am not at all surprised with the taste, simply amazing. This is a foodies' paradise.  I will go straight to the food. We started with Punjabi french fries and I can say it very easily, all the french fries I have had till now were not good enough, the quantity and the taste was simply amazing, they even put fried pudina at the top - wow! MCD and all other fast food joints, go home!!! Next we ordered, chole kulcha, delicious, this was in par with all the chole kulcha I have had in Delhi, Jammu - brilliant We ordered a butter milk, lassi & masala cold drink as well, lassi was outstanding while the other two drinks were good as well, but the lassi overshadowed everything :) Last, we ordered cheese paratha - I wish we ordered some other paratha, as I don't like so much cheesy stuff, it was not meant for me. But those who loves loads of cheese in their food, go for it. In sweets, we order cream fruit and shahi tukda, I personally have never like shahi tukda much and same was the case here but if you like shahi tukda, go for it; I bet you will like it here as well. Cream fruit was good.  I wish they had more options in sweets: like gulab jamun, more varieties in kheer etc. Overall food - 5/5 No complaints at all, whatever I didnt like much is something I dont like already :)  Service was great and very quick - 5/5  Value for money - 10/5, after having so much food, you would expect your bill to be atleast around 1500 in any small or big restaurant. but the total bill came out to 980 only, which is pretty good for 3 people.  Ambiance - well I dont want to rate this restaurant on Ambiance, its a dhaba style, so you should keep in mind that you won't get AC etc etc.  Loved the place, would definitely love to visit again and again"
5.0,"What a Paratha!!"" These people make one of the most Authentic north indian paratha in a south indian city. We ordered a chole batura, peas paratha and paneer paratha. I expected the paratha to be small , to my surprise it was the size of a thali plate,quite generous The smell of the rich butter melting on the hot parathas was a feast to the eyes. Sumptuous meal !!"
4.5,"Food is nice ... if u get a chance to take a bite there having buttermilk or lassi or parata is a must. I think i had best chaas at this place till date. Ambiance - Good byt if u go late there is a min 10-15 min waiting (soo many ppl are in the queue for the prfect chaas) Food - I would say average Chass - Perfectly prepared Parata - Mind boggling  Some places are good at presenting the food properly, do not expect shiny ceramic plates with fork and knife here but this place food will definately make ur day"
5.0,"If you are a vegetarian then one of the best place you could visit. This place is great in every aspect. Food is awesome, especially if you want to have some Punjabi food. Music is good, neither too loud nor too low. Most of the time, I will order just a Parantha and a lassi and that is enough."
4.0,"A nice outing with family in the quest of Panjabi paranthas... other than paranthas, lassi & punjabi style french fries rest all is average."
3.5,"Rainy night, finding way in dark to Kapoor cafe and waiting for 30 mins :) Finally I visited this place after long wait. Parking is right before the cafe, no one to coordinate.  You feel the punjabi dhaba ambience straight on entering the cafe, lively place with music.  Menu is good. We had Masala papad , roti and curry and butter milk. Taste wise its good, but not great (personal opinion)  Pricing is little high I guess."
4.5,"It is a lazy sunday, and they regular food joint from where i order food did not have chole bhature. while scrolling the screen down came to know about Kapoor's cafe. tried my luck and it was a wow experience. plus points: quick delivery, nice packing, great taste. typical nothindian aloo ki sabzi. fresh taste and exotic aroma."
5.0,Amazing food! Great ambience! Very nice service! Good place to hangout with friends. Definitely order  lassi and chaas. One different mention would be dhabe di daal that was true to its spirit. Loved it.  Would definitely go back again and again.
4.0,"My friend took me here claiming it is proper punjabi restaurant and I am a proper punjabi who went there to judge just that. She ordered lassi which was a bit thick... Like shrikhand but it was good. I ordered masala cold drink and I highly recommend that. It tastes exactly how it should!! Whoever hasn't had it in their life should give it a try. Same level of recommendation for pindi chhole and aloo pyaaz paratha. They had the perfect aroma, perfect blend and taste, and way of presentation was similar too, to punjabi restaurants. Dal makhani was a let down considering how well they did on every thing else. It is not bad by any means but nothing amazing. Cheese parantha is a must if you've never had it. But not good if one person has to have it all alone... Too much cheese for one person. The place is always quite filled and you should reacj there by 7-7:30pm to get a seat without waiting. The service is excellent... And was quite fast. This place is not for ambiance, it is for foodies who want to try authentic punjabi taste.  Will visit again sometime in the day to try kachodi aloo which is unfortunately only available in daytime."
2.0,Went their at night. Ordered two thali combos: kadai panner and dal makhni. Both of them were two spicy to eat. Quantity was okay okay considering the prize for a combo. Service was really bad. Had to remind  service guy of the order two times. I would recommend if you go there just have their parathas. Main course sucks big time.
4.0,I went kapoor cafe by seeing good reviews. I found good place to eat north indian food. Cafe need to take care of cleanness and hygiene. If you want try then try franchfry panjabi style.
1.0,Got a home delivery just now. I have just 2 word for the food - pathetic and inedible! The vegetables is full of oil and 3x more spicy than usual. Ashamed that I use to recommend this place to friends just an year back. It is just gotten from good to bad to worse to inedible!
4.0,"The day arrived when we finally get to reach the place long awaited in my bookmarks list in Zomato. After so many rave reviews had some great expectations. Also getting good paranthas and lassi (except Patiala Lassi) was a big challenge. So on our arrival we ordered Paneer Pakoda, Aloo pyaaz parantha, Triple cheez parantha, Gobi Parantha, mix veg parantha along with Lassi.  Paneer Pakoda - The besan layering outside was ok but a chilli coating inside it was destroying the taste, anyways it was just ok. 2/5  Lassi - The lassi was plain without any nuts or flavour so a big plus, and it was thick as well, drink it or eat it with spoon but without any malai over the top, so a minus and that too in a small kullad, small kullad glass is bezzati (insult) of lassi. 4/5 for taste  Gobi Parantha - Taste wise just ok nothing great, but the stuffing was good 3/5  Aloo Pyaaz parantha - Filled greatly and have not eaten so tasty aloo pyaaz parantha outside home in banglore. Surely cant compare with north side paranthas since we can get this taste on rad side as well but atleast nice eat. 3.5/5  Double cheez parantha - Nothing but cheeze, one of my friends ordered and it something between pizza and parantha. Just ok. 2.5/5  Mix Veg Parantha - First time eating mix veg paratha with tomoato inside the filling, somehow that was killing the flavour. 2.5/5  We got white makhan as well which was stored in fridge and then served to us.  Overall it was a good experience, since there are no places to have good paranthas in Bangalore so it was a pleasant outing for ur. There is lot which can be improved as compared to north india taste, but at least best place to have punjabi food till now in Bangalore."
3.0,Loved the place initially wen it had so many options with reasonable rates.. The paratha's are the speciality along with the chole's.. The lassi as well.. However the sudden rise in pricing has left me a little sore.. Ofcourse thhe food is really good and the options are very much intriquing.. Rest assured you will be delighted at heart to eat here.. Do try it once guys..
3.5,Very Punjabi place. Don't miss the paranthas they make this place what it is. One thing to improve would be the owner to accept feedback and not keep on giving explanation why he thinks everything was right.
5.0,"Well the demand in here is heights !! Long queue to get a table .. Food is of course awesome . Melting butter on top of sexy parathas and the awesome and unique lassi just made the dinner special.   Quality of food is consistent, simple dhaba style ambiance & good service.  Divine Punjabi lunch , best parathas :P"
1.5,"Visited first time after seeing so much hype. Both curries very super spicy and there was so much of oil. Also there was hardly any paneer in paneer butter masala. This is typically you see in some cheap restaurants but not in Punjabi restaurants. Only good thing was, manager acknowledged all of these issues and did not charge us for one dish and promised us he will ensure this does not repeat next time"
4.5,"This place is heaven for Punjabi food lovers. You'd double your appetite gorging on their finest items. Be it their Punjabi French fries or Triple cheese paratha or Lassi...or something as plain as Fulke and Rajma, you'll not be disappointed.  It doesn't try too hard to impress people with their ambience or decor; instead focusses on its culinary skills and absolutely wins our heart with it.  That utterly satisfying emotion you very rarely get after eating food at a restaurant? You'll get it here."
3.5,This place is their 2nd outlet.. ample parking.. food is homely and true to Punjabi roots.. we tried few of the combos and they are good value for money.. the lassi was nice and creamy.. overall other than the crowded tables it's a good place
2.0,"It was long back when I last visited this place and left with an impression a good reasonably priced place to eat Punjabi food... so when my brother relocated to BangaloreI thought I would show him the place... And to my surprised food was terrible, we ordered Kadai paneer and veg Kolhapuri both were equally disappointing but at the same time, prices have been increased. I have seen that once restaurants are famous they start ignoring the quality and taste of the food they are serving , never thought this would happen with this place.Honestly,this time around I did not felt that food was of north indian taste. It just felt that it was something I can get in any local shop in Bangaloreand that too would be much cheap than this place."
2.0,I'm changing this rating based on my new experience with Kapoor's Cafe. This was first time I ordered something for home delivery and the food quality was awful. I had never this kind of experience while dining our there. Aloo Pyaza pakodas were like of yesterday's and fried again before delivery. Paratha only had wheat floor stuffings were missing almost. They need to look into their Kitchen again to maintain the food quality.
1.0,"Not sure about the paranthas and lassi, but the paneer butter masala was pathetic. When portraying themselves as an authentic punjabi restaurant atleast get the panner butter masala right.  Was dissapointed being a fan of punjabi\north indian\delhi style food."
4.0,Enjoyed a good Delhi feel wala Khana after a long time. Had one of the best chole bhature Here! Just a tad bit far for me. Overall a good place service might be slow sometimes but the food is worth the wait.
4.0,I have ordered many times from here. Awesome veg food. Their parathas are better than other take outs. Breakfast items are also good. Just one problem that this particular restaurant most of the time shows up as closed everytime I try to order from tomato.
1.0,"When you order a Daal Makhni worth 250 bucks you expect something awesome. It was not even like a normal daal. Tasted sweet ( too much tomato puree I guess). Also not sure if they used chicken masala to made it but whatever, m not gonna order from here."
4.5,"This has become one of our favorite places for dinner. Deepakh Arunand I visit this place almost once a month.  It offers tasty Punjabi Khana at a reasonable price. During weekends, it is completely packed and hence, you would have to wait for a good amount of time before you get a table (You might be better off ordering food online given that the waiting time is quite high).  Food here tends to be quite spicy. It is better to inform the waiter in advance to make your order less spicy, in case you are not a fan of spicy food."
4.0,Authentic north indian food. Lassi and butter milk were awesome. Try the cholle and ghee roti here. The owner ia friendly. But i find it a bit costly. But ita okay to pay as long as the food served is good.
4.0,"Good Punjabi food. I went there twice and on both the occasions we had Aloo Paratha and Aloo Pyaz Paratha, and they were quite large, full of butter and tastes delicious. Also there lassi is very good as it was thick. My overall experience was good."
4.5,Been to many places in Bangalore but this truly serves the most amazing North Indian food. Nice service. Must visit for vegetarians. The parathas & lassi is a must try.
4.0,"Had heard a lot about this place and it's authentic Punjabi veg cuisine.Finally got a chance to visit here last weekend for dinner. I think one word to describe the food would be homely! We ordered Aloo Pyaaz Pakoras ,which were a bit oily but sumptuous. We were two of us and we're kind of half done after pakoras and Chaas! You would be spoilt for choices as they have multifarious combos and paratha delicacies. We opted for a Chilly Onion Khasta Paratha served with mint chutney and a Mushroom Masala combo. The curries served with combo were really amazing and tasty. The staff here is very helpful and cordial. The place tends to get overcrowded over weekends I suppose, but it's worth a visit ."
4.0,The dishes were delicious and spicy. The starters were also very good. The French fries were somewhat different but it was spicy and good. Must try lassi.
4.5,"I so wanted to visit this place, but ended up ordering. A real north Indian place and very hygienic and simple yet authentic and satisfying food.  I ordered Paneer Bhurji and it was perfect. It was dry, had great quality paneer, and a perfect mild play of spices. This is exactly how you would expect it at Delhi dhabas. The Veg Kolhapuri was also perfect. It had a mix of all veggies and that perfect Kolhapuri style spices. The veg raita was also very good. The dhabeki daal was perfect too. Not watery and it was very simple too. The phulkaswere also good. The khasta paranthawas also good, though not what I was expecting.  Overall, the food is very authenticand simple. They serve good quantity so be careful when you order on alacarte. I would love to visit the restaurant some time.   Update: I actually visited the place and it was great again. It's a very simple dhaba style place which is there. I tried their paneer parantha. The entire construction, size, and way of making reminded me of Delhi. But what they missed was the paneer. The paneer was good and home made but lacked that Delhi feel. the paneer pakodas were good and so were the onion ones. Their lassi was very good, quite consistent in texture. But it was a tad too sweet for my taste."
4.5,"Ambiance : Apt for a Punjabi Dhaba like place. One would have little concerns over hygiene by looking at the place, but things are clean and tidy.  Food : We went there for breakfast and review is based upon the food we enjoyed. The joint that can make their Aloo Parathas the best, usually gets my attention fast. This was the place where they did no mistake in making the Aloo Parathas right exactly one would love to have. A big sized paratha with a small portion of lassi looked little worrisome. But the thickness of the lassi promised that I don't have to order anything more to calm my hunger.   Service: Service was quick enough to make one happy. Although not sure how the rush hours are there..   Why to visit : If you love north indian food which does not go wrong from the authentic taste, then this is a must visit place. I just wish they would open the restaurant little before 10am."
4.5,"Run by extremely polite brothers and their dad, located at Tubrahalli this non descript place offers great rich punjabi specials. Stuffed paranthas, Paneer pakoras, aloo gobhi and dal makhni couldve been from any popular dhabha in north india. Specials like chilli rice and PhirNi are recommended.  Priced reasonably , combos are decent VFM.   Be prepared to wait for upto 30mins as its very popular with northies and north indian food lovers."
4.0,"Had a family brunch on Sunday morning and loved the Parathas and lassi. Had Aloo paratha, aloo pyaaz paratha, gobi paratha and mixed paratha with authetic Punjabi white butter. The parathas were large, well made and had the authentic touch. The white butter was not as fresh as we had expected. We ordered Puri Choley as well for my little niece and the choley was awesome. We lingered on till it was time for them to serve Khasta Paratha. Ordered Pudina and Chilly khastas and devoured them with choley. We packed some Rajma and parathas home. The chaas was light but the sweet laasi was thick and creamy and we had to use spoons. Also had the fruit cream which was a concoction of minced fruits, dry fruits and cream. While it was past breakfast, they agreed to serve cups of chai which was sweet but strong.  The ambiance is very Dhaba like with painted roofs, wall hangings with quirky jokes on Punjabis and rustic music. Hope they survive the temptation of diluting the authenticity for local flavour. Will visit again surely.                                              lifeisavacation.in"
4.0,Food is awesome but a little heavy on the pocket. Proper punjabi khana. With makhan. parathas are great. Lassi is just the way it should be . A good place to have good north India and delicious food.
4.0,My Fav Paneer Pakoras: the texture of Paneer is so well maintained and marinated very well even though its deep fried. Den cums the Maharaja Thali. Dal makhani Smokey Baigan ka Barta Phulka Raita Pulav Mixed veg curry. ends withe the fruit cream.. the best mixed fruit milk cream i have ever tasted. terrifying Punjabi food and lovely place..                                                                 ...Read full post on sakhiravoordiaries.wordpress.com
4.5,"I dont think they serve food at this place... They serve something that is close to Nirvana... Perfect taste, perfect quantity.. Simplistic menu but you can have your fill. Ordered Aloo Paratha, Chana Bhatura and lassi... Wow... Drawback the parking is not good for low clearance cars... I am sure this was our first of many visits..."
3.0,Had a good time with frds...nice place to chill out... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...........................................................................................................
4.0,"I went into this place along with my friend. It's outer look totally turned us down however we went in because we both were superb hungry. Trust me it's interior are good and makes you feel you're in a Punjabi dabha.  Now coming to the food I ordered kashta paratha which is a three layered paratha, Missi Roti and paneer degchi. Just one word ""WOW"". I totally loved it. For dessert we ordered dry fruit lassi and kheer which indulged my taste buds. I would suggest everyone to try lassi. Conclusion: I'm definitely going back again here."
4.5,"Have been to this place for couple of times and this has become synonymous to Parantha. Bangalore weather, rains and longing for Paratnhas, Kapoor's cafe is the sole destination to be reached! Parantha loaded with fistful of butter with green chutney and Chilled Buttermilk in Clay pots!! The kheer was the best.. Place is done up like a normal dhaba types.. But service was quick.."
2.5,"Being a north Indian, I had huge expectations from the place coz that is the way they market their food. We ordered kachori aloo( Bermi poori), paneer parantha and chole bhature. The servers were attentive but the service was very slow. The parantha was ok but too much of butter on that. Bhatura was v oily and chole were terible. Being a Punjabi, I really don't think the food has a Punjabi feel.Puneet Kalra"
5.0,Best place in entire Bangalore to have Punjabi food. The ambience definitely needs improvement but from the stand point of food quality there is no match - unparalleled food. Kheer is a must to try at this place and different parathas too. Seeing the amount of butter put on the parathas alone would fill your stomach half. It's heaven for 'vegetarian' foodies   I would give it 10/10
3.5,"Been there mostly to order food and take home. People are friendly. Food is tasty and rotis are good. All the subjis that I have ordered tasted good. I do have one complaint though, whenever I have asked for food without onion and garlic, it has not been adhered to. Most of the cases the food does smell of garlic. In one case the small amount of onion, carrot salad that is served with takeaways was stale. Hence the 3.5 rating. I mostly prefer kapoor's whenever I order takeaways though."
4.0,Amazing Punjabi food at very reasonable price ... dry fruit lassi and parantha's one should have ..!!! Doesn't have great ambience but food is awesome and tempt me to visit this place again n again
3.5,"Good only for the lassi and paranthe.  I've been here multiple times and my main observation is the food is slowly being customized according to the South Indian palette - you would find more locals visiting this place than North Indians. You will find weird sourness in some curries and random sweet notes in some others, South-Indian style deep fried green chilies served with pakoras, pudina chutney having too much curd.Secondly, the raw materials and ingredients are, of course, sourced locally, which means even though the style of cooking and preparation is North Indian, the taste will never be the same. That said, the quality of lassi and paranthe still holds since the day the restaurant started, and they are definitely worth another visit."
1.0,Too much spicy and oily... Even told them not to put too much spice they have the same preparation.. Have been there more than 5 times and have tried variety of items but the problem is persistent
4.0,i have been to this place 4-5 times already and believe me.. it never disappointed me anytime Good service .. dhaba style ambience.. lively punjabi music and awsome punjabi food not at all heavy on your pocket..what all u need in bangalore? morning breakfast with gobhi and aloo paranthas along with chaas n butter .. mindblowing i prefer to go on lazy sundays for having brunch   Good job guys!
4.5,"I've been to there cafe at Thubarahalli couple of times. #PureVeg #AuthenticPunjabiFood !!! Quality of food is consistent, simple dhaba style ambiance & good service. Divine Punjabi lunch today, best parathas :P  Those parathas are authentic north indian. Probably the best in Bangalore. They need to start providing curd with parathas though. Ambience is lively too. Service is super quick and the place gives a nice dhaba feel!"
3.5,"I went to Kapoors Caf for an early Sunday lunch. And I realized that I made a good decision going early. It gets too crowded around 2pm. We just had to wait for 5 minutes for a table. The ambiance is okay, I have no complaints. They had probably gone for the dabba feel. Ordered lassi, chaas, assorted pakoras for starters. I have had better lassi and chaas. For a Punjabi restaurant, I expected more in regards to these two items. However the pakoras were hot and delicious. For mains, ordered missi roti with ghee, and mix veg paratha. The paratha was delectable, with butter and was an overload literally! I enjoyed the missi roti. It went really well with the Paneer Degchi Delliwale  the gravy we ordered. We packed home the chilli onion pullav  it was slightly spicy but flavorful. Overall it is a place I would not mind visiting again. For the sumptuous food that they serve here, it does not dig a hole in your pocket. What they can work on is the hygiene factor of the staff. And that's the reason for my rating."
2.0,"OK ambiance...cost is expensive compared to the ambiance, service and presentation. Menu was also not convenient. But the lassi was awesome."
4.5,"Let me start with ""BURRAAAHHH"".....its been a long time since i had good paratha in bangalore(except when i cooked myself ).....so saturday afternoon, hunger at its peak what one person look for is delicious, mouth watering food.....so we decided to visit Kapoor cafe......its hardly 20 mtr from Whitefield main road after crossing GR Tech park......ambience is quite good, one can see bachelor's or family tasting out punjabi dishes.  As usual we started with what punjabi or for that matter North India is known for .....Paratheee.....with butter ..... parallely we ordered fulkas, dal makni , kadhai paneer  and white butter......  Alloo pyaaz k parathe were real treat to me as i was real hungry, must say one paratha with that quantity of butter made us full.....but we continued daal makhni was super, kadhai paneer was having little more gravy, a little less would have been awesome. Fulka with white butter was what you call in hindi     When we got up from there we were full like anything only thing we were looking for was our bed to sleep .....thanks team for wonderful food.....will visit soon for trying out other items too"
3.5,"Decent quality food at reasonable price. Quantity of the food is quite generous. However, don't know why they put sweet in a paneer curry. Ambience and hygiene can also be improved. Overall good experience and definitely recommend it."
5.0,"A group of 15 of us went here on a Friday for lunch and man it was crowded. It's a little place but the good part is there is parking. We waited for around 10 minutes and they arranged the tables for 15 of us and we ordered a lot of items. Service was very prompt and quick. This place has a dhaba vibe with punjabi music playing in the background. We ordered almost all kinds of paranthas which was served with a generous dollop of butter. My favourite parantha had to be the aloo and pyaaz parantha. We even took chole bhature which can be easily shared between two people. This came with aloo subji, green chutney and onions. This was the best chole bhature I've had.  Even the mushroom masala is yumm. Obviously we had a lot of lassis and the dry fruit lassi is the best one! Lassi was served in earthern pots and it tasted so creamy and amazing. It's quite heavy but great for people with a large appetite. We spent around 3.5k for 15 people which is really inexpensive and we had a great time. Great food and good service, must try if you're around this place!"
4.5,"I visited this place with my sister for dinner. My sister had visited this place previously with her friends on multiple occasions. She had spoken very highly about the taste of food here and hence I was totally looking forward to this visit. They serve typical punjabi food and have wide range of dishes to offer.  Ambience: Nice and family friendly.  Food: We ordered for ""French fries Punjabi style"" as starter. Nice crispy and spicy fries with very nice ""kind of tadka"" of coriander and mustard seeds served with pudina chutney and tomato ketchup. This was a very nice twist to the usual fries. Then we ordered the stuffed gobi paratha and stuffed paneer paratha. Both were served with a very generous amount of butter. I have not eaten such wholesome and filling parathas in any restaurant in a very long time.   Drinks: We tried the masala coke. It tastes like shikanji with soda in it. It was awesome and very much required as an accompaniment with the other things we had.  Service: Quick and courteous.  Suggestion: It will be good if parathas are served with a small bowl of dahi as well.  Overall a very awesome experience. Totally recommended. I hope to visit this place again soon."
3.0,Heard lot about it.After reading good reviews gave a thought to try it.But found food very average.Nothing great about it.For us it turned out to be one time visit.Would not like to visit again.  Ambience: 2/5 Food: 3/5  Service: 3.5/5
1.0,"I went to kapoor's cafe today, due to weekend so much rush..Getting seat after 45 minutes to eat mouth watering food but it is not up to the mark. Paneer butter masala was so sweet and once we complaint to manager, he replaced it but the taste is same. So don't order panner butter masala.Although aloo paratha is good."
3.5,"So after a lot of hype from the colleagues, I decided to go and taste all vegetarian food .. Must say the maharaja thali we had was amazing .. This is the branch at Varthur Road .. Good ambience loud music .. Filled with lots of crowd .. The one opened at ECC road doesn't match up to the expectations .. Tried the paranthas there and it was too thick for my liking just laced with oodles of butter .. The music is way to loud here and wasn't a pleasant experience .. Still have to try other times on their menu ."
4.5,"Had heard a lot about this place and so decided to give it a try. I had ordered Aloo Parantha and Lassi. So starting with the Lassi, I would say that it was Amazing. Absolute bang on taste. Unlike other places where you feel like you are drinking more of water and less of the lassi. This was not the case. The Aloo Parantha was also very good. The size good enough and greatin taste. We also tried the triple cheese Paratha. It was amazing.Overall a very good experience."
1.0,"If there was an option to rate zero,  then I would have done it.  Please note that I've not tasted the food.  This is purely for the pathetic way a waitress at this restaurant treats the customers on phone.  We placed the order through zomato app at 9.30 pm. At 10.10, we thought we'll call and check the status.  The lady who answered the call asked our order no. We were asked rudely what the problem with the order was..  I was taken aback by the rude tone,  but nevertheless,  said that we just wanted to check the status on our order.  For which she started yelling saying the estimated time for delivery is mentioned as 10.30 why are you calling now!  I  lost my patience and told her this is no way to treat a customer and we don't need her food and she can keep the money!! She just hung up the call!   Dear rude lady,   1. You are a waitress at a restaurant and your job is to answer customers queries politely.  Even if the queries are stupid (ours was a reasonable one)  2.Even if you are the owner of the place it was very unbecoming of you to have behaved so cheaply!  3. We had already paid for the food.  But you treated us like you would treat a beggar.   4. Without customers, you will not have a business to run.  This was our first order at this place and definitely our last one too!! Please change the attitude towards your customers.  If zomato has to maintain quality, they should blacklist restaurants like these!!!"
5.0,"Its a highway dhaba style restaurant with quirky posters and signboards inside. Their menu is a huge spread of all the north Indian dishes. We went there at 7pm which is their opening time in the evening, so the crowd was sparse and the service was quick. We ordered stuffed aloo pyaz ke parathe which came in the authentic paratha size which is XL with a giant dollop of butter. It was homely, and that is my comfort food so I had a great time eating it. Also tried their lassi which was creamy and sweet, so a thumbs up from me there too. Can't wait to go back and try more of the food they got to offer."
4.0,"I've heard so much about Kapoor's cafe so finally went for dinner to this place. At first I was a bit unsure if I was at the correct place cause there is a big sign saying Kapoor's cafe next to it a pretty narrow road leading to three old buildings. One of them had Kapoor's cafe with an arrow so obviously that was it. After getting in I was relieved actually very relieved to see beautifully decorated restaurant it felt like a authentic dabha with a modern Punjabi twist. Wasn't too much show just about perfect. Very clean place. As for the food we had the onion aloo paratha, and the normal aloo paratha as we had a child so had to tell him to go easy on the chilli. Service was quick and we were greeted with two huge parathas with the butter the size of an eiffel tower. Never had so much butter in one day rather one meal. Anyways the parathas were truly yummy worth every penny. The pricing wasn't too high it was very reasonable. Unfortunately couldn't try anything else so made it a point to visit this place again after a few days for lunch this time had the gee rice, Punjabi dal, chole and malai kofta. Loved the gee rice, the chole was reasonably good, dal was ok ok but loved the kofta that was amazing. It was a bit sweet as clearly mentioned in the menu but we loved it. So to sum up my experience well I liked the restaurant would definitely go again and again for the aloo parathas. It is a good Punjabi veg restaurant hygienic, friendly staff and reasonably quick service. But I'm a tandoori chicken and butter chicken die hard fan so for me to go back to a vegetarian restaurant won't be too often. But judging this place purely on the veg factor well it is a good restaurant, honest and homely that serves good portion of food at a very reasonable price. Chitra"
4.0,The food was good. It had everything that you would love out of Punjabi food. But it was super rich. You might end up with cholesterol just by looking at it :P The location leaves a lot to be desired. This place made me love lassi :)
4.5,"Finally visited this iconic place. Most of the Punjabi restaurants do not live up to their name. But this place is a cracker. Oh my god their parathas!! It's something with dollops of butter on top. We had ordered Aaloo and Aaloo Pyaaz paratha for the two of us. They were yum. One paratha is good for one person though depends on appetite  we had also ordered matar paneer. The curry was good and tasted different ( in a good way ) from the matar paneer that I have had at so called Punjabi restaurants before. We cudnt finish the sabzi coz Parathas had stumped us already. We had also ordered lassi and kheer which were served in kullad like cups, bigger one though. Lassi was thick and tasty and gave Dhaba was feel  and the Kheer was served covered with dry fruits. It incredibly tasty and value for money. Kapoor's cafe indeed breaks the common perception that Punjabi food is all about chicken tandoori and non veg. It is veg restaurant and we didn't miss non veg at all there. Service was quick, efficient and warm. Ambience is average but we aren't complaining coz this place is about gooooood food which this place provides at very pocket friendly prices. Will visit soon"
4.5,"For the first time i felt that i am actually having dinner in punjab. I mean this cafe is just fabulous. If u r looking for the heavily stuffed parathas served with plenty of butter, then just visit this place. Cheese parantha(4 cheese) is the speciality which is just amazing. Also their fruit cream will blow your mind. Do try baigan bharta also."
3.0,"This is the place for pure punjabi paranthas. I like thier Aloo parantha with butter, Pakoras. But lassi is average.  We ordered one Aloo parantha, one Paneer Parantha, one Cheese parantha, and One Palak corn sabji with Curd.  All paranthas were fine. But really i don't like lassi taste . Palak corn taste was ridiculous and particles of sand in it . Worst Dish don't order this from menu.  This one is good for paranthas only. Ambience: 2/5 Food: 3/5 Service: 2.5/5"
4.0,"Great vegetarian food, affordable prices. Reminds me of the cherished punjabi dhabas that line up the highways. Always crowded and noisy. Ambience is nothing to talk about. Homely tasty food, good service is what keeps bringing you here again."
4.0,Well the demand in here is heights !! Long queue to get a table .. Food is of course awesome . Melting butter on top of sexy parathas and the awesome and unique lassi just made the dinner special. Service is bit late and the waiter too doesn't recommend any special dishes .Place is too congested. But ya an awesome experience al together .
4.0,"Great food. V good quantities.  Combos are great.  Not giving 5 star because they're a bit on the higher side on pricing given the ambience, location and furniture.  Have tried the Parathas, pindi chhola bhature, lassi and the rajma combo and on taste they're the real thing from Punjab."
4.0,Good authentic north indian food. Chole bature was huge and super tasty. Tried their three other combos with paneer ..sabzi ..and kachori.. All were yumm. Only thing which we found missing was variety in  sweets...their kheer was very good..but rest all was average. Overall loved the food ..
4.0,Taste of punjab in banglore. Ambience is average. They play loud punjabi /bollywood punjabi songs which i enjoyed while having food. Nice punjabi style food. Dont forget to have lassiiiii ..... :)
4.0,"Food - 4.5/5  Service - 4/5  Ambience - 3.5/5  Dishes to order: Dal Makhni, Paneer Lababdar, Pindi Chole Bature (Dilli Style) (Available till 3 PM), Fruit Cream,  One Line Tip: Crowded on weekends, ample parking space available. Their Thalis are a hearty meal for 1."
4.0,"The statement ""Never judge a book by its cover"" absolutely fits for this place.  Though it looks like a normal place,  the yummy food will definitely bring you back to this place.  The place is hygienic, good and  fast service, and not but not least the tasty delicious food."
4.0,"Located on Varthur Hobli road, this place seems to be a bit shady from the outside but trust me the food they give inside will flip your perception. Really loved the chola bhatura and paranthas we had here. Reasonable on the pockets too and the service is quick too."
2.0,We ordered aloo parathas and the paratha was less of aloos and more of Coarse Ginger pieces and Green Chilies.It was not worth the hype created about it.
4.5,"Have been there several times.  Never disappointed. Portions are huge & loaded with butter, consider this before you order if you are a small eater."
5.0,My favourite vegetarian restaurant. I had come here for lunch and dinner. I had to wait for a table but its totally worth the wait. From spicy curries to sweet lassi this place has it all.
2.0,"Not great food and not authentic punjab food as mentioned ,liked Lassi though. Ambiance is not good it is more similar to 40 seated Daba. Fare is little upscale. Service also not good one need to ask for napkins, water etc every time."
5.0,The reason for 5 star is the desert that is served here. I was completely mesmerised with the taste and full rich dry fruits. Even the food in north i dian style is not less in comparision to deserts. Will recommend people but bit pricey.
4.5,One of the best place in town for paranthas. Aloo pyaz parantha is a must try for everyone. Combos are also good and economical. Lassi glass can be a bit bigger.
4.0,"Great parathas.. my fav is aloo paratha, sweet lassi. I have eaten the same combo umpteen number of times. Chole bature, punjabi style french fries, kheer, chaas, shahi tukde, veg pakoda, paneer pakoda are the other things I have tried. Great food. Just tht the place needs to be cleaned up a bit. The tables are sometimes dusty. By Far the best aloo parathas that I have had in bangalore. I also love their kadai paneer, phulkas, boondi raita, paneer butter masala, chaas, masala soda."
1.0,"I have been to this place lot of times. Around 10-15 times. But quality and quantity is coming down every time i visit here. First of all guyz I dont know on what basis it is rated so high?  Ambiance? Pathetic. No air conditioned. No comfortable sofas or chair. Chairs which are more like stools are there.  Food quality: Punjabi flavor. Ok well. There are many options in Whitefield which are delivering better food.  Price: SOO high. Mostly combos start at 300 which is ridiculously high for such unhygienic restaurant.  Have tried their paranthas. And they were real good, crispy tasty and well buttered. Chola bhatura mediocre. Pindi chola lacked its authentic taste. Kachori combo is ok. Paneer Currys are average.  Mostly avoid visit during after noon. You will sweat like anything because temperature shoots very high. We need to rate any restaurant based on ambiance, seating comfort, service quality, food quality, food quantity."
1.5,"Ordered food via home delivery for the first time. I was shocked to see the oil floating on top of the vegetables. Perhaps some folks like their veggies that way, however I had to drain literally a 1 cm layer of oil from the container. So this may be ahold place to go for its cost effective food, but big NO if you are looking for a tasty yet balanced North Indian meal! The gravy was too spicy as well. Overall avg experience. Wouldn't order again"
4.5,Nice place.. authentic Punjabi veg food.. nice parathas with desi makkhan.. affordable price..after having 1 stuffed paratha you will be full.. lassi is must have..
3.5,"Decent place for north indian food lovers. A little over-priced though. Service is quick and they have attractive menu , only sad part being non-veg food not served that too this being a punjabi restaurant!"
4.5,Good place Retro ambience with a propper punjabi taste food. Must go for the paneer paratha and the lassi Both were too good. And for sure it had some flavors of the punjabi dish
4.5,"The only problem is the location. Had a tough time searching for this place at 9 in the night. Apart from that, extremely friendly service. Great place to hangout with friends. Not a good place to dine with your date as there is no privacy at all. Economical and great ambience as we were 6 people and the bill came out to be around 1500, which is really great for the food they serve. Would definitely visit again."
4.5,Amazing food! Prompt and courteous service! Small but well managed place! Slightly expensive but worth the quantity given. Definitely worth a visit again
5.0,"This place has been in my best bucket from the first time I visited.   I just love the parathas especially the Cheese Parathas, but recommend to have other food as well...it's mouthwatering. You would love the authentic North Indian food.  I would give 5/5 on everything, service, ambience, cost and most importantly food :)"
4.5,"No doubt why this place has such a higher rating in spite of ambience like a dhaba. The reason is amazing food! The lassi is amazing and parathas are full of tasty stuffing and lots of butter!  They tasted so amazing. The Aloo Parathas were the best I've had in a long time. The Phulkas and the two curry we ordered next viz., Veg Kolhapuri and Paneer Butter Masala were delicious too. The Veg Kolhapuri was on the spicier side and just was the perfect blend of spicy. We wanted to try the Khasta Parathas and we had ordered onion and chilly ones. They were really spicy and only gulping down their chilled Lassi from the Kulhad could bring down the taste of chillies in our mouth."
3.5,A punjabi veggies cafe...you can try paneer pakora for starters here...veg kolapuri is good option for spice lovers...lassi is authentic but if served in those big punjabi lassi glasses would be unbeatable
3.5,The quality of food has definitely come down since the last time I had visited here.We ordered Malai Kofta and Kadhai paneer served with roti.Both were average to say the least.
4.5,"I wanted to check this place out since heard about it a lot. As I saw the board from the main road, I thought this can't be it. It looked suspicious and dingy adding on the friday night effect. Anyway, decided to move in and decide for myself. As i approached the main restaurant, it was a complete twist from how it looked like earlier. There were all sorts of high range automobiles parked in the limited space, corporate and college crowd chatting away comfortably. Coming to the food, absolute marvel and cost is way under the roof. Khasta Paratha with dal is a must try.  Hygiene score goes down a bit. Do pick up a tissue and wipe the oily plates and glasses before you start hogging.   Cheers Div"
3.0,PROs: Pure Veg. Big parking. Quaint set up. Variety of dishes.  Cons: Unhygienic kitchen. Unskilled staff. Steel crockery. It was very hot inside restaurant the day I visited. Costly as compared to the quality and presentation of food.
5.0,"Awesome Punjabi dhaba@ Whitefield.. heaven for vegetarian food lovers, am not one though but still no complaints. Food - 5/5 Service-5/5 Cost-5/5 Ambience- honestly didn't get much time to look around as dishes were served with lightning speed  Loved it, totally"
1.0,"Really bad experience ordering from this place.               I had ordered paneer dish, but it was really bad in taste....................."
4.5,"Amazing restaurant...the food was very good and nominally priced, friendly and courteous people and prompt service! hope the service continues in the same manner!"
4.5,"One of the best places to have authentic north indian food in Bangalore.The menu is extensive and the food tastes good. Everything is reasonably priced.Personal Recommendation: French fries (punjabi style), lassi and whole wheat 4 cheese paratha"
4.0,Proper punjabi food. Well stuffed parathas and tasty. Malai Kofta is a must have at that place. Lassi is nice. Good service .Reasonable price. Can improve the ambience. I will surely come back here.
4.5,"A must go for the vegetarian ppl. It's awesome paratha and the combos can make one drool. Too much of punjabiana. Ghee butter and super lassi. Too heavy at times but a yum place to try out.  Ordered pindi chole, masala papad, lassi, four cheese paratha. Layered cheese Paratha was awesome with decent chole. Service is super quick and the place gives a nice dhaba feel!  The lassi is amazing and parathas are full of tasty stuffing and lots of butter! Looking forward to go here once again to try chole bhature for breakfast!!!"
3.5,"Yummy Food , no doubts there. Very friendly staff. Takes a while for your food to be served. Yummy, heavy parathas. But, the quantity of lassi (yummy ! ) was a put down. I've been to places who provide awesome lassi, thrice the quantity at almost the same price. So yeah, other than the lassi, a good (noisy) place :D"
3.5,Are your test buds craving for quality north indian food.try the place out. ALL the stuff paratha' are like stuffed with goodness. And sweet they serve an awesome kheer and shahi tukra.and drinks go for keser lassi.
4.0,This was my third visit. As usual the food was yummy. Do try their Cheese paratha and Kadhai Paneer. Space is a issue but the food makes the inconvenience worth it.
5.0,"Interior and decor is simple but the food served, people and service is extra ordinary. We ordered aloo parottas, kulchas and paneer butter masala and we found it very difficult to stop ourselves from craving for more. Keep up the good work. Wishes!"
3.0,"Recommended by one of friend,so wanted to try , went on sunday lunch , place was crowded and noisy , food was nice ordered 3 different paranthas size was good but something was missing in the taste but it was ok,  kadai panner , kheer , lassi  and masala pepsi everything was nice in taste  Down Part- service  was slow  Overall nice place to have punjabi food , if one is ok to be in noisy env :)"
3.5,Well.. after seeing a rating of 4.. I decided to go this place.. it was a sunday afternoon.. the place was pretty crowded and full.. food was very good.. service was a little slow.. v had called for 4-5 things.. 1 of it never arrived.. I could have given it a 4.. but 3.5 due to not so awesome service..
3.5,"It's a pure veg restaurant serving Punjabi food, one of the few of its kind. Not very fancy but ok decor. Parathe and lassi are good.  We took combo as well but didn't like the paneer dish, makhni daal was also okish. Not that great.  Overall ok for 1 visit. Didn't find food to be exceptional.  It's more of a hangout for bachelor's, may be that's why it's so popular."
3.5,This place has been life saver for me on those days when I don't want to cook and I need some good food. I mostly prefer home delivery as this place is crowded obviously for the amazing food & the management never disappoints me if I have any special requirements in my food. Kulhadi wali kheer is one of the amazing kheer I have had it in any restaurant.
3.5,A good place to grab some delicious veg food.. slightly over priced but the quality is truly awesome. .. visit at evening time as in summer its hot in afternoon
3.5,visiting this place you get a kind of homely atmosphere and homely food as well. recommend visiting this place when your feeling really hungry and empty stomach. thats when u'll really enjoy! emmmm
4.0,my son had taken me to this place and i really loved the food and ambience and service as well. a must visit place for the entire family. Its a quiet and nice place to sit and enjoy your snacks
5.0,Best North Indian Food in Banaglore! Absolutely Love this place and can never get bored of it! Home food away from home! Lassi must have - Best part they serve it in Kulhhad and also the paratha's they serve are the best
4.0,"Kapoors cafe new outlet at ITPL main road, opened a month back. This is bigger than the 1st outlet. I've been to there cafe at Thubarahalli couple of times. #PureVeg #AuthenticPunjabiFood  Quality of food is consistent, simple dhaba style ambiance & good service.  Divine Punjabi lunch today, best parathas :P  1.Paneer & Aloo+Onion pakodas 2.Cheese Paratha (Onion, tomato, danya, green chilli, slices of cheese) I had with extra cheese it's was yummy! 3.Aloo payaaz Paratha  4.Dry fruits Laasi  All the best Kapoors Cafe team!"
4.0,"Been there today with friends for brunch. We had paranthas, Lassi, chaas and Chola Bhatura. Food was great, authentic Punjabi style.Service was fast. It's a nice restaurant with beautiful interiors. Owner is friendly."
4.0,"Very Nice service and Punjabi cuisine. Kachoris, Parathas, Dry Fruit Lassi(Not Plane) & French Fries are recommended. Also the owner and staff are very humble and wanted to serve with good foods contrary to others where they JUST opened it for sake of rolling money."
4.5,"First, the only bad news - this place just off Kundanhalli in a nondescript location and very non-appetising access. That's the only bad part really.  As soon as you has absolutely an delicious north indian food aroma floating around, is totally packed and seething with customers. The seating is very average but the the most relevant part - the food is OUTSTANDING. In particular, we loved the lassi, buttermilk, stuffed parathas and the palak paneer. Everything else was very good too but clearly Mr Kapoor and his cooking team seem thoroughbred Punjabi's.   And oh, did I mention, the prices are really cheap for a wholesome, flavourful meal..."
3.5,"Nice place to have ghar ka khaana type food...special recommedation for ""dhabewali dal""...very nice lassi and chaas there....in all good food,"
4.0,OMG  The palak paneer here is The best. Having it with Kulcha is the best combination.  If you stay somewhere near Whitefield then you need to try this place.  It is amazing.
4.0,"Nice punjabi dhaba located near thubharahalki bus stop. It was crowded in the night, had to wait for a long time to get a place. Taste is good,  keer is a must try item here."
4.0,"Have been to this place for couple of times and this has become synonymous to Parantha. Bangalore weather, rains and longing for Paratnhas, Kapoor's cafe is the sole destination to be reached! Parantha loaded with fistful of butter with green chutney and Chilled Buttermilk in Clay pots... mmmm what else can add up to your happiness :D The recent renovation in the interiors and Punjabi music makes the place more lively.  Food 4/5 Service 4/5 Price 4/5 Ambiance 4/5  Would keep visiting this place for the love towards Paranthas and the quality they maintain in preparing it."
3.5,"Kapoor's Cafe has all the dhaba feels. It's easy on the wallet and the portions are so generous.  We ordered paneer butter masala, which was alright, aloo puri, which was delicious and the puris weren't oily at all. Rajma was ridiculously bad, it tasted like boiled rajma added to chole. The phulkas and rice were quite nice. The highlight was the lassi, served in a kullad with a spoon, it's sweet and thick and amazing!"
4.5,Went to this place for sunday lunch.. Wanted good northindian food. Chole bhature was awesome ..huge bhature and chole were tatsy. Had two combos... One with chile n kachori and other with roti and dal makhani.. Flavours were perfect. The kheer was the best.. Place is done up like a normal dhaba types.. But service was quick..
4.5,"We did go to new branch next to GR Tech Park . All the items we ordered, were up to the mark. Parantha was huge and awesome. Ambience is ok(don't expect much)."
4.5,"No fancy affair but good food and good Service. if you want to have good punjabi Veg food ,just try them out . Paratha's , Kachori Combo , Dalmakhni and Chole bhature all were fantastic . Lassi was too sweet for my taste. Will surely visit during my next outfield trip : ) ..Cheers guys"
5.0,"What I say about Kappor's cafe.. I have become the fan of Kapoor's cafe from the first day... Yesterday again I visited the place , I had two and half (!!!) Paratha with yummie butter...dry gobi . chaas and lassi....wow... what a taste... If there is any option to give me more than 5 rating, I would give more than 5... everything is good and perfect.... all the staffs are very friendly with a smile.... When you leave after having food..a smile and thank you from The Kapoor will give a extra cheery on the cake and satisfaction.... jiohh Kapoor's cafe..."
4.0,"Super place for vegetarians who r just looking for some good food. Well it's the right place to be if you can make it early otherwise wait in long queues. We came here all the way from Ecity to enjoy culinary pleasure. We arrived there by 1.30 n got a seat soon as we were just 2. Started with lassi ,served in matkas/ kulhad kinda,tasted yummy but I felt lacked the authentic punjabi taste. For main course we had paneer lababdar n fulkas. Paneer lababdar was good n quantity was good enough. Rotis were soft. Wanted to try their kheer but it wasn't available, so went for fruit cream which had loads of cream n less of fruits,actually it had more dry fruits. Definitely VFM n a must try for people in n around Whitefield."
4.5,I am a regular to this place and it amazes me that how consistent it has been in providing a delicious food experience. People love authentic North Indian food here. Don't forget to try lassi which they provide in traditional mud pots.
4.5,based on complete panjabi theme food is good and chep.. service is also good amd staff is very friendly. this was my 3rd visit to this place and i loved it.
5.0,"I hate to wait. But this restaurant was worth a wait. Even if you go early for dinner this place has like 25-40 mins waiting time. But by God their food is delicious. Rarely you get all awesome food, reasonable price and fun filled ambience. Buy far the best place in bangalore to get North Indian food. You will go crazy after having paneer Tikka masala and ghee parathas over here. Went berserk on aloo and cheese parathas. Literally over eat that day. Must visit place if you are missing Punjabi food. Almost forgot to mention thick Lassi."
4.5,What you are looking for in punjabi style restaurant is here in one single place. Great Food Amazing Service Nice ambience Worth of each and every penny No finger bowl is only drawback in this place
4.0,"My visit to kapoor`s cafe had been long overdue and I ended up being here quite unexpectedly at 10pm on a Sunday night. The place was crowded and had a huge waiting line. Fortunately, I didn't have to wait for long (because it was just the two of us). There was no light and they had arranged for candles on tables. It was a cool breezy night so the ambiance seemed that of a typical north Indian dhaba on highways. The restaurant had a very cosy and homely feel and the staff was very welcoming. We ordered a thali to get a taste of many items at once. It was Combo6 which had dal makhni, shahi paneer, boondi raita, ghee fulka, matar pulao, masala papad, lassi and kheer. We ordered missi roti as well. I just loved their lassi and chawal ki kheer! The dal and curry were delicious as well. Masala papad was a little bit spicy though. I wouldn't say that it was authentic Punjabi taste but it definitely was as close to it as one could get all the way in Bangalore. I'm coming back for more. :)"
4.0,I ordered food from this place through zomato. The food was delivered within 30 minutes. They also gave me a complimentary lassi which the tasted as good as their gesture. The paranthaa were very tasty and the gravies we ordered were simply yum! I think I am going to order again and again every time i have a vegetarian craving!
3.5,"The food is good,  but the place is a little congested. We ordered thali and had almost everything one can have during lunch.  Must visit place if u are new in bangalore and craving for some north indian food."
4.5,A must go for the vegetarian ppl. It's awesome paratha and the combos can make one drool.  Too much of punjabiana. Ghee butter and super lassi. Too heavy at times but a yum place to try out.
3.5,A decent place with complete Punjabi ambience welcoming you with Malai marke lassi in mud cups. Parathas and phulkas are the best here. You can have paratha with alu dhaniya ki chutney which is the best combination. The north veg meals are also very good to eat.  The curries chutney Roti parathas have the authentic Punjabi taste.
5.0,"A must place to visit for anyone who loves delicious Punjabi food! Awesome service and yummy food makes u happy and when u get d bill receipt, u feel happier.. you can't stop yourself from revisiting the place.. who does not like to get more by spending less;-)"
3.0,Sevicing was good.i like the lassi n French fries.rest of the food was ok ok.i ordered the raita which was good the boondi quality was not good.i ordered choke bhatoore which was ok.
4.0,"If you find yourself bored of regular food on a lazy sunday morning, head straight for a sumptuous breakfast at Kapoor's cafe. Recommend the kachori aloo and you absolutely cannot miss the chaas (I find myself finishing up at least 4 of them in one go! )   And if breakfast is not your scene, then go over for dinner. Their bread type kulcha goes down easily with any side-dish! Also, try a lassi with this combination maybe.  If you are around kundalahalli area , then you gave to put this on your must-go list"
4.5,"Visited this place after hearing it's praise from a lot of people. It truly lived upto that. Ordered pindi chole, masala papad, lassi, four cheese paratha. Layered cheese Paratha was awesome with decent chole. Service is super quick and the place gives a nice dhaba feel!"
4.5,"Was visiting Bangalore and this restaurant was my lunch place two days in a row. Loved the sweet lassi to go with the paranthas, chole bhaturas. Overall a great place for a quick heartening Punjabi dish."
3.5,"A Parantha Paradise! The paranthas are thick, tasty and served hot with a generous amount of white butter. A tasty addition to this is a chilled sweet kullad lassi. The service is quick but the ambience is not very impressive. The ambience can be overlooked, as this is quite an affordable eatery in Whitefield!"
4.0,This place is always buzzing. The food is really good!! Those parathas are authentic north indian. Probably the best in Bangalore. They need to start providing curd with parathas though. Ambience is lively too.
5.0,"Outstanding parathas and gravies. Hot parathas served with a lump of butter melting over it looks too good to resist. This is ""the spot"" for people looking out for veg delicacies - Punjabi style. sually sees long queues on Sunday evenings and why not so? When you get yummy food without burning a hole in your pocket. We ordered Paneer butter masala, onion khasta paratha and pudina khasta paratha. Their iconic lassi is a must have! The portions were huge and the taste as well. Good place to eat on vegetarian days. Good job with the service too."
1.0,"One night I and my flatmates decided to order food online. After doing so much research on Zomato we decided to go with Kapoor's cafe. Since the rating was good, we were quite sure that food is going to be good. But, to the contrary the quality of food was way below standard. The phulkas were smelling like they are made of 3 days old dough. We were hungry like dogs but still we coudn't even had a bite of it. It was a pathetic experience and I am highly unsatisfied and dissipointed by the kind if response we got from the resturant when we complained about the food. I would really like to appeal to Kapoor's Cafe not to play with somebody's hunger. Kindly check the quality of food you are delivering because once you have dissipointed a hungry customer he is never going to come back. I in my lifetime never gonna order anything from this resturant and I will make sure no body around me do the same. I am attaching a pic of one of the phulkas and trust me it tasted even worse than what it looks."
4.5,This is the only place where I have had the best punjabi food in Bangalore  Way to go guys.
5.0,"This is ""the spot"" for people looking out for veg delicacies - Punjabi style. Even though they have limited starters and desserts, the main course compensates for them all. We tried both paneer & aaloo paratha. Aaloo parantha was good and so was mushroom masala. The ambience is good enough, not grandeur. And the service was nice.Overall, a decently priced Punjabi place which serves outstanding parathas. After all it is a joy to take all your Non-veg buddies to a veg restaurant and make choices for them."
4.5,"Its been a long time since my last review, well this place is the reason that brings me back to food blogging. In Bangalore it is almost impossible to get Punjabi food that is this good... to add to it the goodness of this place being pure vegetarian. The place makes me go WWOOOOAAAHHHH!!!!  Kapoors cafe is not a fine dine restaurant so when you go here expect a dhaba experience and you will not be disappointed.... !  I have been here twice in the last two week, both the times with work colleagues... i understand if you plan to visit on the weekends or for dinner please be prepared to wait for being seated. it does pull a good foot fall....  Coming to the core of the review the food: 1. Lassi / Buttermilk - served in a earthen cup - it is really well made - the Lassi is super thick you will need a spoon to finish it up - however just the right amount of sugar not to make it too sweet. The butter milk is as thin as it should be so just the right balance. It is super child and served at the right temperature. The only reason i reduced the score of this place by .5 points is because the earthen cup is typically sticky on the outside and i am not sure of the hygiene of these cups. 2. Parathas: I have tried the paneer and gobi parathas - this is the true punjabi parathas - they as big and thick come with a dolop of butter and taste awesome. No where else in bangalore have i tasted parathas that come close to Kapoors. Each plate is one Piece of paratha but it is the size of a big plate itself and the butter is close to 50 gms so well served :). 3. Dal Makhani - punjabi black dal i wouldnt compare it to the fine dine dal makhani but it is one of the best dhaba style dal makhanis i have had in a while - it is a little low on the finness but awesome on taste. 4. Paneer lababdar - i would call this average - though people swear by it - i have had better paneer lababdaar - its not the best in town but decent enough... 5. Brinjal Bharta - very well spiced and loved it well made baigan bharta punjabi style.  Overall lovely food - and i would keep going back here....  Ambiance: 6/10 (the place is in a tin shed does tend to get a little warm - look for a table in front of the coolers) Food: 9 / 10 (awesome punjabi food) Service: 9 / 10 (good for a dhaba) Value for money: 11/ 10 (awesome value for money lunch for 6 costed us 2K)  I will keep going back :)"
3.0,"Ridiculously overhyped. Don't get me wrong, the food is good. Just good, not great. The parathas are well made though I've had a lot better elsewhere. The dal makhani was great, the chola masala was decent at best. Their dryfruit lassi was okay, although it wasn't as cold as I would have liked it to be and was really less in quantity for its price of 100 bucks.  Now here's the bigger question. Is it worth standing in line for 1 hour on a weekend to get a table in this tiny little place for food? Well- no. Just no."
4.0,"A Sunday Morning Punjabi Brunch (opens only by 11) ..  Start with chaas in the matkas and move on to the heavy poori/ kachori and subzi/ Chole.. Poori with aloo is a real good feast over here.. The soft aloo and the tangy gravy just goes with the lustrous poori.. The soft panner pakoras are really yummy ..  (Ask for extra chat masala!!) There are wide variations of parathas too here.. Oh my god! The butter and the parathas.. Mmmmm..Of course go with more friends , you get to have different variants in a go.. Eat till you collapse!"
3.5,Full points for service. We ordered all the recommended items.  Aloo/gobhi parantha 4/5 Khasta parantha 3/5 Dhabe wali daal 3/5 Dille paneer 1/5
3.5,"THE KAPOOR'S CAFE I visited kapoor's cafe after reading some rave reviews about the place on zomato. I love great indian food,excellent Indian food and I can say with confidence I had a very good dinning experience at this restaurant. It's North Indian food served,the causal dine in restaurant has carved for itself a nice place among all the cafes in Whitefield . The interiors have been done to give you feel of Punjab.most try..."
4.0,Pros 1. Nice and yummy food at affordable price 2. Typical north indian taste available in food  Cons 1. Average service 2. No air conditioner available so hot during lunch hours
3.5,Given birthday treat to friends here. Service is fast and food is good too but bit overrated in terms of rating. There is a lot to improve on ambience and sitting arrangements.
4.5,Lovely North Indian food. Paranthas were very authentic.. Meal combos were awesome.. Pindi chhole was out of the world.. Bhaturas were very thick.. If only those could be made thin.. Paneer was very soft & tasty.. Must visit if you love North Indian food..
1.0,Went there after looking at a 4 point rating on Zomato. There is absolutely nothing great about this place. The food is overly priced for the qty and ambience they offer....the food is so oily that you need to pop in an anti acid pill as a desert post your meal. The place was over crowded and the service was hugely compromised. Definitely a zero repeat value!!
4.0,"They server authentic north Indian food. Daal tadka roti lassi and paneer biryani are yummy. Only problem is its very rushy, it needs lots of patience to go there on weekends. Taste is good, ambiance is ok types."
4.5,"Proper punjabi food, and pretty inexpensive! The daal was awesome, with ever so hot, homely fulkas, and of course, Lassi! If you want to be high on food, Kapoor's cafe is the place to go!"
4.0,No doubt why this place has such a high rating in spite of ambience like a dhaba. The reason is amazing food! The lassi is amazing and parathas are full of tasty stuffing and lots of butter! Looking forward to go here once again to try chole bhature for breakfast!
5.0,Want to have tummy full and yummy food please visit this place. Authentic Punjabi food. decent ambience but who cares when food is awesome. Worth the price.Dileep Nanjappa
5.0,"Outstanding parathas and gravies. Hot parathas served with a lump of butter melting over it looks too good to resist. This is ""the spot"" for people looking out for veg delicacies.

4.0,Its a great place. Paranthas are too good there and lassi is even better than home made lassi. Totally loved this place especially the music and masala parantha.
4.5,"Been to this place once after hearing about it a lot from several people during my 3 day stay in Bangalore. The food was pretty good. We ordered aloo pyas paratha, kadai paneer, Punjabi style French fries and chaas. Aloo pyas paratha came loaded with butter. They also served mint chutney with that which tasted really good. The kadai paneer and French fries were decent. The only drawback is that it is really crowded during peak hours and you will have to wait if you decide to eat here. Overall it is a place with really good North Indian food and you'll love it even more if you are a vegetarian. If I'm to visit Bangalore again, I'll definitely go to this place again."
1.5,After going through the wonderful reviews..thought of giving it a try. A complete wastage of money..a very over hyped and expensive restaurant with not so great ambience. I tried all the dishes suggested here..sorry guys..a thorough disappointment!!!
3.5,"Looking for some heavy lip smacking food...this is the place to be.!!They have tried to create a dhaba sort of ambience...Food is very tasty here..parathas are just awesome!!ambience is something which needs to be worked upon more...I visit this place regularly so I notice they are working well step by step to improve the ambience..the host is very hospitable and service is very good..the place is always crowded..!! Recommended-dry fruit lassi,c cheese parathas.. Overall rating Food:4/5 Ambience:3.2/5 Service-4.6/5 Value for money-3.8/5"
4.0,"I have been to this place couple of times for delicious punjabi dinner, and never have been disappointed by food. This time we went for lunch, and it was SOOOO HOTTTTTT, and top of that we were surrounded by tables full of sweaty people who just finished their matches in nearby sports academy and came to the restaurant to grab quick bite. Nevertheless, we settled down and ordered the usual. My favourite soft aloo paratha with a big spoonful of butter, green chutney and lassi in earthen pot, yummyyy. Have tried the aloo kachori combo n chole bhature as well, kachori was nicely flavoured with hing but somehow the texture was very hard and brittle, no complaints for chole bhature. For dessert we ordered shahi tukra, which tasted great and was full of dense cream and almonds. Only request to management is to add AC in the place."
4.0,"Perfect north Indian tadaka.. Visited for lunch. Little bit crowded but worth waiting. Parathas are awesome, slight green chilly on top give awesome taste in paratha. Perfect place for full tummy food at reasonable price. Honestly saying good to see some Hindi speaking crowd around. Also try fruit cream it's really nice. Love to visit again.  -Amar"
5.0,"Food was really taste and hygienic, delivery was on time. will try again definitely. i have ordered aloo paratha, rotis and paneer butter masala."
4.0,Thick and yummy lassi. You might get confused whether to eat it or drink it. :P Have tried the paneer paratha and aloo pyaaz paratha. Food is simple and tasty. They put so much of butter on the paratha which I love. The other dishes in main course are equally good.
4.0,"A perfect parantha - punjabi food place! It's a small place with lots of noise n liveliness.. Quickly served and authentic food. We enjoyed the parantha we tried - aloo pyaz, mixed & gobhi paranthas."
5.0,My friends took me to this place bcz I felt like having good vegetarian food. Yeah!  That happens sometimes :p When we reached there.. I see that It's a Punjabi themed restaurant and serves Oly Veg..also there was a huge queue to get a table in there. I was amazed. Getting a table even at 9 pm takes time.. Not that the place is small..but it's the yummy food. I loved everything.. From lassi ( U can't finish it alone) to normal rotis.. Daal.. Paneer.. Yummy. Would love to go back soon. PAUSE.  (Salvating)  :p
4.5,"It's hard to find good and delicious Panjabi food in Bangalore. If you are foody then you will surely like this place. Food quality and taste is mind blowing but ambiance is disappointing. All in all, this place is worth to visit."
4.5,"Really good multi grain starter, dry fruit lassi was good too. The paranthas were really nice. Khasta paranthas a must try. Paneer dilliwale is really good and dhaba dal was authentic Punjabi. Service a bit slow"
4.5,"This place is my all time favorite and it serves that purpose well as it is right next door. Although a vegetarian place, but their parathas and lassi will definitely tickle your taste buds and leave you completely happy!!   Our evening hangout spot and the fact that it is extremely pocket friendly has a huge advantage. The food is immensely delicious and I would suggest their lassi and aloo k parathe as a must try!!   Great going Kapoor's Cafe!! :D"
4.0,"Outstanding parathas and gravies. Hot parathas served with a lump of butter melting over it looks too good to resist. This is ""the spot"" for people looking out for veg delicacies - Punjabi style. Even though they have limited starters and desserts, the main course compensates for them all.   For starters we tried all that were present, since there were hardly 4 different ones. While all kinds of pakoras were oily, Punjabi french fries was good amongst the lot. It took time to decide upon the gravy and breads. So glad that we bought Paneer Degchi dilliwale. One of the best sweet gravies I have ever tried. Only few places prepare proper Malai kofta and this definitely is one not to be missed. Aloo gobi and paneer butter masala were no less delicious.  For breads we had got phulkas, four layered chilli parathas, aloo parathas, paneer paratha. Nothing could reach the satisfaction level of Aloo paratha. Man! These guys actually know what they prepare.   Dry fruit lassi was one worth-buying dessert.  But chaas seemed a bit overpriced for the small matka they provide.   The ambience is good enough, not grandeur. And the service was nice.   Overall, a decently priced Punjabi place which serves outstanding parathas. After all it is a joy to take all your Non-veg buddies to a veg restaurant and make choices for them.   I would highly recommend ""Paneer Degchi Dilliwale"" gravy and Aloo Paratha."
1.0,"Had been to this place yesterday for dinner after reading many good reviews from zomato. We were very hungry.. Ordered lassi, gobi paratha and aloo paratha. Lassi was very tasty and raised our expectations on the food. Then comes the parathas looking yummy topped with lot of butter.. but when we tasted.. they were a disaster. Both the aloo and gobi parathas were so salty that we couldn't even realize any taste or flavor. The green chutney was not even edible with too much of salt in it. As we were very hungry we weren't able to return the food.. instead we decided to order some curd to curb the saltiness. So ended up ordering masala curd with pudina. It was just some 250ml low quality curd topped with chat masala and salt (again too much). They have put a bunch of dried pudina leaves which were not fresh and turned black. The worth of it couldn't be more than 10 Rs and what we paid was 100 bucks. The manager turned a blind eye on us when we tried to explain him the kind of experience we had. Don't go by the overrated reviews (They can be fake) and give this place a miss."
4.0,"Decent food. Lots of butter and ghee. Paneer pakoda is good. Paratha is just ok but the makhan makes it look good. Went for lunch, was a little hot inside."
4.0,"Delicious and lipsmaking Punjabi food, thats what Kapoor cafe is all about. It usually sees long queues on Sunday evenings and why not so? When you get yummy food without burning a hole in your pocket. We ordered Paneer butter masala, onion khasta paratha and pudina khasta paratha. Their iconic lassi is a must have! The portions were huge and the taste as well. One turn off was the incessant chatter and babberings of the crowd. It was like too many people speaking at the same time and too many children shreaking at the same time. The ambiance was a lil chaotic. But alls well that ends well. So, the food was awesome and my experience too."
3.5,"Had heard alot of praise for this place. Being a  Punjabi, I waa tempted to give it a try as it is famous for its Authentic Punjabi taste.  We ordered parathas and meal thaali. Taste was indeed great, obviously because of the ghee overload (Punjabi afterall :p). But I find it a bit over priced. I don't prefer paying 70+ rs for a parantha no matter how good it is. But yeah, it can be considered fine in Bengaluru as almost everything is priced on a higher side here anyway."
2.0,Food was not up to the mark. Panner dish and Chole were tasteless. The Roti was made out of sour dough. I ordered food after seeing lots of good reviews but totally disappointed.
4.5,"Mouth watering Parathas and delicious Lassi. I have visited this place a dozen times always when I crave for Parathas and Lassi. This place is run by three Punjabis. The ambience used to be simple two years back and have improved since then. But still a one floor layout trying with the three people trying to fit in the public with the calm attitude. Well mannered staff. Parathas well served with lots of butter, chilled Lassi served in mud pots either plain or mixed with dry fruits. Pulkas  are served hot and soft and they have good variety of gravies from paneer to Rajma. Food is economical, I think the prices have increased since two years but the food is still worth the money and won't dig your pockets.    Head there for simple Parathas and Lassi.  Kudos to the three folks! Good job!"

3.5,"Food.. Full on Punjabi style of pampering your taste buds !! The quantity of butter just makes you flow in heaven. But that taste of items is not compromised at all. I had ordered 3-4 items and they were all amazing. The best among them was PUNJABI FRIES which is French Fries with fried Coriander tadka. The Kulchha was cottony soft and tasted good. The only thing which bothered me a bit was their service. I requested them to add some salt and chilli in dal makhni which was actually missing but they refused to do so. Other than that, it was a perfectly good food experience."
4.0,"When you crave for some Dhaba style food but do not want to go to the outskirts of Bangalore, Kapoor's Cafe is the answer. Located inside a compounded area, it is more or less a shack. Despite the negative reviews about service we went there with our fingers crossed. The ambience is good with the whole Punjabi humour adorning the walls as posters. We were 8 of us. And the orders started flowing. For starters we ordered French Fries Punjabi Style, Onion Aloo  Pakora and Paneer Pakora. The Paneer Pakoras were done a bit too well and didn't really strike a chord with us Then we ordered a few Parathas and each of them came with a generous serving of butter (This definitely is not a place for weight watchers). They tasted so amazing. The Aloo Parathas were the best I've had in a long time. The Phulkas and the two curry we ordered next viz., Veg Kolhapuri and Paneer Butter Masala were delicious too. The Veg Kolhapuri was on the spicier side and just was the perfect blend of spicy.  We wanted to try the Khasta Parathas and we had ordered onion and chilly ones. They were really spicy and only gulping down their chilled Lassi from the Kulhad could bring down the taste of chillies in our mouth.  The service was prompt even with a decent crowd. And the host were friendly and pleasant.                                              seekingthatperfectlife.com"

3.0,"I recently went to this place.. It's sort of dhaba style.. Had phulka, Khasta paratha, veg Kolapuri, lassi, chaas.. I felt the taste was average and for that the place is little over priced.. The ambience and service is OK.."
3.5,"NOTE:  Went there on two separate occasions, breakfast, and dinner. The rating given in this review is for their dinner service.   As we entered the small and dark lane leading to the restaurant, we were directed to the designated parking space, which was ample.  On entering the restaurant, we were greeted by blaring punjabi music, and what looked like an intentionally grungy decor. The corrugated roof, the frames encasing edgy ""keep calm and..."" quotes and the somewhat underground feeling of the place set up a quaint ambience.  We were greeted by a waiter, whom we asked to set up a table of six. He set about joining two tables, a four seater and a two seater. The only hassles in the process where that, a) The two tables where varying in height b) One of the tables was stained to a point where even the famed cleaning fluid, Colin, bit the dust.    When we tried to explain to him why cleaning the table was futile due to the above mentioned points, he resorted to more vigorous rubbing of the stain. Finally, after close to five minutes of requesting him to change our table, he gave in. It was not the ideal beginning.  While ordering, I recommend asking the waiter to get the lassi along with the food, because it is usually served first and by the time the food arrives, the four inch matki shall be bereft of lassi.  The mixed paranthas arrived first adorned with hunk of butter that would eat away three gym sessions. The stuffing was good and overall, the parathas were truly tasty.  The sabjis arrived later, Paneer Degchi Delliwale and a Veg Kolhapuri. Unfortunately, we were left staring at these, since the rotis where yet to come. We waited for what felt like an eternity (closer to 3 min) staring at people eating and food on our table that we couldn't. Finally the roris arrived, missi rotis and plain paratha, Both the rotis where quite good and did a good job delivering the sabjis to the mouth and complementing the flavours.  The Paneer Degchi Delliwale was truly the star among the sabjis. It is slightly sweet and goes amazingly well with the roti and the lassi. The veg kolhapuri was average at best and could have done with a pinch lesser salt.   Overall, if you were to come here, come for the parathas, and if you were inclined to try their sabjis, try the Delliwalle. The lassi is tasty (and highly recommended along with meal), but its quantity leaves a bit to be desired.  Kapoor's cafe is place where the food is above average. Lower your expectations, you will have a good time.  PS: This place does not have a tandoor. So no rotis, naans, kebabs or such."
3.5,Food is very good. The parathas are soft and filling. But too crowded and the ambience is not that good. Good for ordering takeaway but be prepared for the waiting time.
2.5,"On reaching this dinner destination I had a feeling that this is indeed something special, given the waiting list, and crowd awaiting their turns, and the buzz and all here. It seemed pretty busy hotspot initially till we got a table and ordered food. As suggested and acclaimed, the lassi was wonderfully delightful but seriously low on quantity. The next came the paranthas, which did had a good stuffing for each variety, but the unnecessary butter chunk over it which even tasted a lot sour, was kind of spoiler. Chhole Masala and Kadhaai Paneer was just as average as it could be. I started wondering about all the hue and cry for this such average place. Is it the only punjabi restaurant in near by or it had a better name which this restaurant is still thriving upon despite present situation."
2.5,"I went to the new outlet today (behind GR Tech Park).  I had high expectations given the 4.2 rating, and was thoroughly disappointed.  The dry fruit lassi had peanuts in it and the portion was small. There was a lot of gravy and few chhole in the Chhola Bhatura dish. The paneer parantha was average (any of the regular Bihari/Orissa cooks found in apartments today could cook the same).  If you're not a bachelor without a functional kitchen, give this place a miss."
1.5,"had ordered from this place through zomato, order didnt arrive complete. ordered 2 parathasa and a dry fruit lassi. the lassei was not delivered"
2.5,Nice staff service.......... It's a pure Punjabi restaurant...... The parathas are good...... Do try French fries and lassi.... The main course for ID not that good according to the price
4.5,"So my friends and I went tonight to this place slightly overcrowded but well maintained. It took sometime as it was on reservation basis, but we got in. The food is awesome and worth waiting for over here. We ordered stuff cheese paratha and it was delicious, and on all of that a big piece of butter to enhance the paratha flavour, what else does a Punjabi  want paratha with a butter on it. The lasso served in a matka is one another delicacy you would want one more. The gravies are properly Punjabi style and even the place have a Punjabi touch.  Its a great place to go and recommend it to everyone"
3.5,"I have ordered online on zomato from this place a couple of times. The best reason for vegetarians to order food from Kapoor's Cafe is that minimum delivery amount is just 99/- . I have tasted the Gobi, aloo pyaz and paneer paratha from this place. All 3 tasted pretty decent with Gobi paratha being the best. The parathas are of decent size with good amount of filling. Good value for money. Would definitely try the other dishes as well."
4.5,"If you love punjabi, I bet you will be a regular customer of this cafe. Parathas with lassi an epic and must try combo. Alot of tasty varieties to have. Service is good, people and owner are very friendly. The matka lassi is very nice. Do order white butter with parathas, you will love it."
5.0,Delicious food..like the atmosphere in the restaurant-the punjabi songs ...the staff is really cheerful with quick service..good place to hang out with friends
3.0,"A decent place for paranthas. Their aloo & gobi paranthas were really nice. Fruit cream was superb. The biggest issue i have with this restaurant is the service part. We waited 35 minutes for paranthas while people who came after us had already finished dinner. Every time i got up from my seat so that i can catch the waiters attention, they made sure they did not notice me as my order was nowhere ready. No good food is worth such a lousy service. Dont even bother visiting on a sunday nights as crowds are massive."
4.5,Go there for lip smacking Punjabi food :) There's nothing else to write about. Ambience sucks :P but who cares about ambience when you have food in all its glory around. And it's a heaven for vegetarians as it's an all vegetarian  place. They also have certain dishes marked in blue that they can make without onion-garlic. I love the food here. Be warned as it's high in oil and masalas but what the heck! And blaring bolly Punjabi music in the background. You'll come back with your tummy happy
3.5,"Went today with my colleagues during lunch hour, its a new place just behind bhagini restaurant in the Upkar Layout. I went on the second day of the opening and seems to be good. Though it is a bit heavy on the pocket wrt the food items they are offering but the quality of the food was good."
4.0,"Was here for lunch with a few colleagues on a weekday... As it wasa weekday afternoon we had no hassles in finding parking space or a table...Comingto the food , We started off with lassi....it was served in a matka andtastednice...For the starters we had assorted pakoras,,, They were a combination of panner and onion pakoras.. the mint chutney served was more of a highlight which had a tangy flavor which made the pakoras extra tasty....For the main course it was ghee phulkas and veg kholapuri.... there wasgenerous amount ofghee on each phulka and the veg kholapuri was spiced perfect ....For the dessert we had fruit cream... Its basically a fruit custard topped with dry fruits and served in matka... simple and neatdessert this is...                                                                 voiceofmytastebuds.com"
4.0,"This place has some good vegetarian north indian food. We had aalo and pyaj paratha and it was delicious. It was rich in butter and taste. Also, I liked thick lassi which was severed in a clay pot! Best part is that place is economical."
4.0,love the thalis here. They come at a reasonable price. The variety is good and the quantities are also superb. Good place to eat on vegetarian days. Good job with the service too.
3.5,"Word of mouth travels faster than advertisements. This place is the perfect example of that. But it's not easy to locate this place at night for people who are visiting for the first time. I think they should at least put up an illuminated sign board to let us know where this famous restaurant is located. Coming back to the place, it's a typical mid sized resturant where food speaks more than the decor. Not the fancy place that you would take your loved ones to showcase your finesse but definitely a place if you want to treat them to a nice little dinner. The parantas are good and the lassi is sweeet (there's an extra ""e"" for the extra sweetness). Tried the different rotis available and none of them dissapointed. A definite thumbs up for anyone looking for substance over form. And it would be crime not to mention the most important thing, it is really economical."
5.0,Excellent place for Veg Punjabi food. Their parathas are too good and lassi is something which I never had in this part of world. Yet to try their breakfast. Its my favourite place for veg food.
2.5,"Heard a lot about this place.. So finally went there... It is like a dhabha.. With no AC.. So if you are planning to go in day time, get ready to get sweat while eating... Ordered paratha n one paneer gravy... Paratha was good and gravy was just okay... Ordered curd also... It was tasteless and Lassi was not cool at all... What is the point of having hot Lassi...  The food is good but they are charging very high prices which are not at all worth if you see the ambience.. They should either reduce the price or change the ambience...."
5.0,I tried few times and the food is really awesome in taste and it makes me to order every time when i want to have the food outside. I would say i am addicted to this food. Only thing which can be improved is the cost. It is bit costlier.
4.5,This place serves tasty Punjabi vegetarian food. On the weekends it's usually crowded and you might have to wait 30-45 minutes to get a table. The service is usually fast and they always welcome you with a smile. I have been here multiple times and have always walked out contended and happy.
4.5,This was our first dining out after having kid. And hands down my kid loved this place. The waiters and managers were very friendly and got full marks for this. They helped us for comfortable sittings for us as we have a baby. We went here for last sunday for dinner and quite a surprising the place was not that too good. They dont have even AC but frankly who cares if we have such a lovely food. Food was very delicious. Trust me this will be my place now for atleast once in a month.  Whatever we have ordered all was yummy.
1.0,"If you want break-up with your girlfriend take her there. It was so congested. We went after seeing zomato reviews and got totally disappointed. No air to breathe, chairs are lined up very closely. Even the roof was so low, that you feel suffocation inside. After all this, if you want to save money, you can go there."
4.0,"Fabulous! Great Indian breakfast! This place in whitefield is certainly the best for some heavy meals. Featuring in amazing breakfast places, this place is always brimming with people and food is a delight to have. From the parathas to the lassi, from snacks to a lunch meal, this place is a heaven for foodies. I went here on a friday afternoon for a quick lunch between my working hours. As usual, it was all full. We ordered for a twin paratha combo which had two mouth-watering cheese paratha and a paneer paratha. The large parathas are enough to get one settled for one. They make the parathas so tasty with a lump of butter on it making it more tasty. Then the lassi in a kullad, which is always fun to have in that style. The shahi tukda, the childhood memories with it, hardly i had a good one in the city. It was just amazing here and felt satisfying.  Service is excellent, quick and friendly. The only tad bit of disappointment which one could face is the electricity cut which we had to face unfortunately. The absence of any power back-up in the afternoon can really get the place all heated up and you might get drenched in sweat while having those heavy buttery parathas. Apart from this, this place is worth visiting for its taste and variety for north indian traditional food, especially breakfast. Not very costly and worth the money spent. Might have a waiting que at peaks but then you wont mind waiting a bit for some good food. Ambiance-3/5 Food-5/5"
4.0,Best thing here is cheese paratha...they are just awesome..breakfast items like poori aaloo are great.. Taste of the food in general is good.. Good place to go for good North Indian food..
4.5,"very simple and good quality establishment with no nonsense food and a good menu reasonably priced, friendly staff and good parking. a really nice place to meet, waiting times can be long during busy times but usually its worth the wait!"
2.0,Over-rated restaurant both by hype and money. The food served is very average. Rotis had already dried. Must have cooked 3-4 hours ago. Starters were decent but not up to the mark. Only thing I loved here is the Lassi(Cold and sweet enough).
2.5,"Drove for almost two hours in the blazing sun to try this place,  but was utterly disappointed to know that electricity was out and the place was really small.  Added to this were terrible paneer pakoras that lacked taste and masala papa's which was just excess salad on a small papad. Despite all this,  the only satisfaction was in the form of main course.  The aloo pyaaz and 4 cheese parathas were yum.  If not for the weather and the heat,  that drizzling cheese paratha with loads of butter would have been a making in heaven.  The aloo gobi masala gravy and kadai paneer were equally good.  Must visit place if u are a paratha lover.  P. S Ensure power cut isn't there to avoid a disastrous experience :P"
3.0,"Visited this place today after reading rave reviews on Zomato! This place does serve justice to its 'authentic Punjabi food' tag.  We ordered the paneer pakoras and masala papad for starters. Both were average and had nothing great to mention about.  We then ordered some parathas and kadhai paneer and aloo gobi gravies. They were served hot, with butter and were really yummy and filling!  The setting is small and they have quick service!  The major setback, however, was that there was no electricity when we went and they did not have power backup. The place was literally dark and the hot summer added to our woes. We were all dripping with sweat. This really ruined our entire experience and hence the poor rating!  Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience and facilities - 1/5 VFM - 2.5/5 Overall 3/5"
4.0,"One of the few good places in Bangalore to have Vegetarian North Indian food. Found this place on zomato, read so many positive reviews and, although its quite far from my place, decided to go for dinner last Sunday evening. As mentioned in many reviews, the place was very crowded. But once you are seated, the hospitality/service of the staff is super fast and assuring. We had Lassi, Chhaas, Dhabe ki dal and Kadai Paneer along with phulkas and aloo paranthas. Lassi and Chhaas, they serve in clay pots (kulhad), tastes Ok. Dal and Paneer dish were good, phulkas also soft but Aloo Paranthas were the best among all the dishes, generously stuffed and topped with lots of butter. If you are looking for a good North Indian veg restaurant, this is the place to be!"
5.0,"We had been here from office, wanted to visit the place after having heard a great reviews about this place from many.  This is a pure vegetarian punjabi restaurant, everything inside reeks of punjabi attitude :)  which is good.  We ordered lassi, onion pakoda and parathas and 2 curries (different varieties). Lassi didn't disappoint us, it is thick and served in khullads.  Pakodas was a disappointment, but we did finish, maybe we expected a different variety.  Best part is the parathas, they are simply awesome, fillings are good. Portion is good. Curries were also good.   Overall a very satisfying visit.   Will visit soon with family."
5.0,"Really appreciate their warm gesture as they not only replaced the wrongly delivered item but inspite of insisting to take back the previous item, they made us keep it , additionally a complimentary kulhad lassi was also sent.   Their prompt service and quality of food is highly commendable. Thank you."
4.0,"I have heard people say 'that place next to my house i have heard it is good' but never been there. We believe we can go there anytime but never been there. Kapoor's Cafe is on my to everywhere yet we have missed it always. Vegetarian food. Neigh! We are strictly non vegetarian people. Yet our first pleasantly surprised us by it's simplicity. Felt like home with service. Parathas yum. Lassi, there was a virtual fight between me and my 3 year old daughter for every spoon. The size of lassi was non Punjabi and quantity augmentation is a must. Authentic punjabi food is now in my backyard. Kapoor's food has soul."
3.0,"Ambiance: Small *inside city* dhaba type ambiance, good punjabi music. Not as happening of a place, as I expected.  Food: Average. I went there in the evening with friends ordered some starters and lassi. Starters were not very good, and lassi was not cold enough (or something, it was OKish..). Parathas were good. Didn't try actual food so won't judge it much. But whatever I had was not that good.  Service: Good. Friendly people.  VFM: Good. I wanted to go here from a long time, as it was a punjabi place and I heard a lot about it on FB, so off my bucket list.  Should visit once."
2.0,"Ambience is average and crowdy. We ordered messi roti, Paneer dechqi, Dal makhni, Veg Kolhapuri and dry fruits sweet lassi. All the items were average in taste, say 2 out of 5.  Lassi was not good at all and sour. Even reported that to manager. Servicing is 1 out 5. Have to wait 45 mins for food. Then for extra bowl an spoon have to tell waiter 5-6 times, which took 10 more mins still it wasn't there. Finally my frnd got up in middle of having food and went to the counter telling them to give bowl n spoon on my table. Mine was a bad experience. So, won't visit again."
3.5,Ordered aloo paratha and paneer mattar gravy from here . Lipsmacking parathas  but the gravy was very oily. Parathas are really big and one paratha makes your tummy full . Found the price little expensive.
4.0,"Awesooooome food! Full on veg punjabi food. Easy on pocket, good variety, authentic taste and dhaba feel. Each bite of any item screams ""Punjab"" loudly. Need i say more?"
3.5,"Its a very average place when you see the ambience but it serves authentic Punjabi khana with homemade butter,the chaas here will you remind you of the best chaas you've ever had.The paranthas my favorite is the gobhi parantha is amazing and the curries will remind you of home the aloo jeera the gobhi masala and the quantities served are enough for two .The daal makhani and the dal fry are awesome with the jeera rice.The assorted pakoras are worth a try and also the masala French fries are awesome.Though the price is little high for veg food but yes you would want to revisit this place just because of the taste of the food there."
1.5,"Highly over rated! Nondescript ambience, it was too hot but that was expected without air conditioning. Even the fans are not evenly placed all over. Coming to the food, we got excited about Kadhi being on the menu, it was pathetic, so was cholley bhature. Even the lassi was not cool enough. If this is the definition of good food then I don't think people here have actually experienced 'Authentic Punjabi Cuisine'. Highly avoidable. Get Dal Makhni/Cholley delivered from Box8 instead."
3.5,"Went with a friend today as i had heard a lot about it's food.We went at about 8:30 pm and it was fully crowded. We took a seat and ordered. The food was served in 10 minutes. We ordered aloo onion pakoda (average taste), masala papad, lassi, ghee roti, missi roti, plain paratha, paneer lababdar and shasi tukra The lassi was just superb (served in a small pot), even the ghee roti was very soft. paneer and tukra was also delicious.  The waiters were also very gentle and served politely.  Only one negative point that i found was that the food was too costly. No doubt the quality of food, the taste, the service all very very good. But for me paying 20 rs for a ghee fulka, 40 rs for a half glass of lassi....... is a bit too much."
4.5,A perfect Punjabi North Indian restaurant with awesome cuisines. Don't miss Makke Ki Roti and Sarson Ka Saag. You may have to wait a bit as queues are long everyday.
4.0,Typical Dhabha ambience.Dint pay attention to the music(was busy hogging).Started with lassi(includes thick cream n may not be liked by all) and masala fries which was just about average.They can work on the chutney.Masala papad was a little spicy.Jeera rice was good and so was malai kofta(rather had a very rich n heavy taste).What won my heart was the Cheese Paratha and the hospitality of the staff from the owners to the waiters.
3.5,I ordered food for home delivery and it was delicious. The aloo paratha was super yum and the lassi was pretty decent ! Good food at affordable prices
4.5,"Craving comforting, home style and unapologetically hearty Punjabi vegetarian khaana? Head here. Everything is tops, the warmth of their servers, ambience, and the piping hot food served makkhan maar ke. The stuffed paronthi, missi roti, dal dhabe wali and lassi are terrific! As is the Pudina chutney served on the house. Order what you fancy. You won't regret your experience here, that's for sure."
4.5,For every punjabi food lovers it's a one stop food joint. You will get almost everything from punjab on menu. It's a family run show and you will feel like you are in home.  Please taste the dry fruit lassi and khasta roti for sure.
3.0,Went there with lot of expectations. Not worth 4.5. Ambience was good. Food was OK.if you are a North Indian then don't expect too great a taste. Not value for money.
2.0,"Aloo paratha - 4/5 Pudina khasta paratha - 3.5/5 Onion chilli khasta paratha - 3.5/5 Lassi - 2/5 - doesn't taste like authentic Punjabi lassi.   The 2/5 is for the insane heat. Low tin roof is like a perfect slow cooking oven. On a 38 degree afternoon, I felt cooler when I stepped out of the restaurant. They were also cutting onions which made me cry as I ate. Plus it was smoky inside the resto.  Definitely not going back until they fix the unbearable temperature.   Food is good but had to eat quickly and leave. Should re name the place to kapoors cafe and sauna.  Don't understand the high ratings given to this place."
5.0,This PLC looked like a garage at the onset and I got absolutely disgusting looks from my friends for suggesting this PLC!!! I told them let's have the food and then pass the judgement and they are now brand ambassadors of this PLC... That's how amazing the food was... If u like desi north Indian food (dhaba types) go to this PLC and u will be absolutely satisfied!!! We ordered Parathas which were loaded with butter and finger lickin good!! Even chaach was real yum I polished off a couple.... The chole bhature were fantastic too and the potato curry served along with was super delicious!!! Double thumbs up for this PLC!!
4.0,"I have been the usual customer to this place.The food is what keeps me coming to this place with my family .Best place for authentic veg punjabi food.There is not even one time when we don't start of with the Thick yummy lassi or flavoured Chhaas.  Must try You can start with punjabi masala fries /bread pakoras or the usual ones/kalmi kebab.Make sure atleast once in a while you go there to try out the garam garam paranthas with dollop of fresh butter .try out cheese parantha & aloo one ,but if ur planning to have cheese one ,make sure you come with an empty stomach.Its super filling Sides i would suggest Dal makhani,who wouldnt try a dal item from punjabi style-5 star one. ;).Kadai Paneer and Kadai Mushroom are my favourites.You can go for the universal paneer makhani if you do want a sweet twinge to your side. When it comes to rotis ,khasta/missi is super good !Do try !its bit hatke from the usual phulkas,if you want to know the description ,the staff would definitely brief about it to you.  Ambiance:4 Presentation:4 Hygiene:4 Food : Hi 5 ;)"
3.0,One more name is removed from bucket list . Heard about this place from so many foodies and finally visited this place few weeks earlier . seems to be very popular place as the place was jam Pack on weekday evening . We ordered panned and daal expecting authentic Punjabi preparation and we were not disappointed . Not having an option of tandoori roti was quite disappointing. Also . Buttermilk in Kulhad is a good idea but I found it to be very expensive . ( portion size of butter milk was more like a sampler) .  I agree with many other reviewers on Zomato that this place is over hyped and over priced . Service is good and ambience is like a small dhaba which adds to the charm.
4.5,"Visited this place after playing badminton. Situated inside the Gurukul Sports campus. The ambience reminds of the highway side dhaba, but fails in that attempt.  So had heard about the parathas and truely they exceeded the expectation. The paratha lovers heaven in short! Had tried all the parathas, but Aloo paratha is the best, others are good too. Sabji is good and bread(phulka, missi roti) is okay/avg. Lassi is served in thullas, and it adds to the flavour. Service is a bit on slower side, but understandable, as its heavily crowded.  Its a paradise for people crazy for parathas. Chak de phatte...! Ambience - 2.5/5 Food - 4.5/5 (extra 0.5 for parathas) Service - 3.5/5 Pricing - 4/5"
4.0,"Ambience didn't had anything which will attract you. But when it comes to food, it was super awesome. Dry fruit lassi took our hearts. And for vegetarians it will be like a heaven. Service was good because restaurant was overflowed with guests but then also they managed to get food on time. Waiters were quite friendly. Enjoyed the dinner at Kapoor's Cafe."
1.5,Came to this place after reading reviews on Zomato. Really disappointed with the food because it was tangy and the rotis weren't baked well. The place was fully crowded. Didn't enjoy the experience here.
3.0,"Over-hyped place or perhaps a bad day in the kitchen. Either way, the food wasn't that great. Not even a single dish lived up to the expectations, be it the daal makhni or paneer lababdar. Even the chapati wasn't good enough. Average at best after hearing so much about it."
3.5,"I ordered aloo pyaz paratha online. While ordering it seemed little pricey but when i received the order i found EXTRA LARGE size parathas so the price was totally worth it. Taste was good and they gave 2 small amul butter boxes which made those parathas taste even better along with the green chutney. Maintain the good taste Kapoor's cafe team :) Next time i am gonna order lassi too, about which i have heard so much."
4.5,"As a foodie, rarely do I condone the use of the phrase ""too much butter"", because I believe there is no such thing. But I met my match at Kapoor's cafe. The amount of butter lathered onto the hot steaming parantha was sinful. It moved me to tears. Kapoor's may not be some big air conditioned restaraunt with fancy paintings or candles, but there are punjabi memes hung on the walls, the staff are friendly and polite, they treat you as a guest in their own home, and serve you wicked amounts of butter on their paranthas. Best time to go would be winter, as it tends to get a little crowded and stuffy. But it's worth a little waiting and a little Bangalore heat.                                                                 wheredoieatnext.wordpress.com"
3.0,"Having been a hardcore non vegetarian, wanted to try out this place which has quite positive reviews. The experience of taste has been average as I had ordered for home delivery, being a Punjabi restaurant the Kadhi had pakoda with seeds pun intended the batter was hard and under cooked even my 9 year old kid said it is yuck, multigrain strips as starters were different and the starter Aloo Gobi Dry was better than the above two dishes. I would be trying few more dishes to form my opinion. However the packing and salads seem to be hygiene."
4.5,"Awesome. One of the best in town. I'm strictly non vegetarian but after having food from this restaurant, I haven't missed non veg since a week now. Also the varieties of parathas and Dhabe ki dal are so tasty that I've been here 3 times in a row within a week now !!! The guys working there are all really good, serving quickly and with a smile. I'm giving 4.5 and not 5 is because of the uncomfortable seating arrangement and  ambience."
4.0,A place to go of you like the punjabi cuisine. Its a vegetarian cafe and has lots of famous punjabi dishes on offer. I particularly tried out kulcha and naan which were equally good with butter on top of them to add to the taste. The curries were good. One item that stood out was the matka lassi.
3.5,"We visited with our kid in tow, and the experience was very good. We had a waiting number of 12, but were called in within 20-25 mins. Service is super fast. Staff is courteous. The management ( 2 brothers and dad?) are very involved and upbeat. Always with a smile and polite. Place is small, basic, but well lit and ventilated and clean. Packed, every time we went. Food is decent, served fresh. Not oily or spicy. Lassi too sweet for our taste. Phulkas were fresh and hot. Rajma average, Shahi Paneer was good. Jeera rice - very nice. Definitely VFM."
4.0,Kapoor's Cafe offers amazing parathas with generous filling and green chutney which is usually hard to find in Bangalore.  We tried both paneer & aaloo paratha. Aaloo parantha was good and so was mushroom masala. Dal Makhani was okay. I did not like the Lassi that they served.  Ambience is noting to talk about but very reasonable prices.  Food - 4/5 Ambiance - 3/5 Service - 4/5 VFM - 4/5
3.5,"No frills place, with fast and friendly service and tasty food! We usually stick with the stuffed paranthas and pakodas- which are really the stand out dishes here. Hard to find comparable stuff in Bangalore. However, main course dishes and gravies are quite run-of-the-mill. Nothing to write home about."
4.5,"Paranthas are just awesome here. Served with butter on top the butter slowly melts into the parantha to make the taste awesome. Lassi is also nice here. So, even if you not in the mood to have something heavy, you can easily go for a lassi and it will fill up your stomach."
2.0,An overall rating of 4.3 ?!!??  I found the food to be average to say the most!  Wouldn't want to go again unless absolutely without a choice around.
4.0,"After hearing about this place for a while from friends today we decided to order from Kapoor's cafe - the punjabi junction  Being a non vegeterian who generally stick to non veg options, I can say that Kapoor's cafe is one of the few places where I will go back for their veg options.  We ordered our lunch - aloo jeera (very tasty), ghee phulkas, ghee rice, dal makhni, palak paneer..Except for Palak Paner we liked everything. The star of the day was the fruit cream...too good!  The order was delivered promptly in 45 mins as promised. Heard the ambience of the place is quite good too.. Will walk in soon hopefully"
4.0,A solace for those who miss the North Indian food loaded with spices n of course that sumptuous dollop of butter...  Raided this place when we were damn hungry.. Had a tasty paneer paratha n the unusual triple cheese paratha with amazing lassi served in an earthen pot... :)
4.5,"Kapoor's cafe is a prime example of the wonders of ""word of mouth publicity"" and the role of ""early adopters"". Set in a place that can easily go unnoticed, this little beauty serves up the most amazing vegetarian food. Food has optimum spice and each helping is sufficiently large. Just like any authentic punjabi place the assortment of stuffed parathas are delightful. And if after all of these you are still not satisfied, I bet their dry fruit lassi served in a ""kulhad""(an earthen pot) will blow your brains.  The only downside is the waiting time and the ambiance. Surely they can afford a better and bigger place. But one can say that the quality of the food surely negates the downside of waiting."
4.0,"So after hearing so much of this place from my friend..she ordered from this place.. This place offers really amazing parathas , generous filling and tasty green chutney. We had both paneer n aaloo Paratha.. But aaloo was really delicious .. Would go back to the place sometime to try on more things.. But heard there's a long waiting queue ,so need to hop in early"
4.5,Quaint little dhaba set up. But very hygienic. The parathas served with a big dollop of butter is an absolute delight. The portions of lassis served in small matkas could be a bit more
4.0,Nice place to have a quick snack while youre hungry. i love the parathas here. Their really yummy. This is one of the places where you get good vegetarian food. The ambiance is nice and the service is quick.
3.5,This is a very very over hyped place. The food is good but not as much as it is hyped about. The ambiance is very very ordinary. I liked the makki ki roti and mushroom masala that I had.
4.5,"A treat to Remember,  With authentic North Indian Taste, Some Hot, Smashing Crisp Paranthas, Made the night.  We ordered Aloo Pyaaj, Onion, and a Paneer Parantha, with 2 Lassi and 1 chaach( Butter Milk), and a Dal Makahani.  Was bit disappointed with the LAssi and Chaach, as the outside container was cold but inside was not at all cold, so it took away the good feel out of it, specially in summers like this.  The food on the other hand changed our mood, it has good taste, decently presented, and very rightly priced.  Certainly worth a visit."
2.5,"Sadly, it was a pathetic experience for us. Poor arrangements, unclean and such a delay in getting the food! Totally unworthy of the time spent there. Bad taste, bad preparation and unfortunately even the Shahi thukra was sick."
5.0,proper place for all Punjabi foodie's !! fruit cream must try ! Punjabi style of fries ....super yum  pretty crowded but the food is worth much more. Punjab is zero km (best tag line )
4.5,"If u have Punjabi food in your mind , this is the place. I have been there 3-4 times and never had any complaint about the taste. Staff is good and friendly though place is a bit let down, specially during noon period. I can't say food is cheap but since they don't compromise with taste it's worth, I would have loved the place if there was AC. Overall this definitely is the place worth trying."
4.0,"If told in short, Punjabi junction in Bangalore. Cravings for punjabi food, want to indulge into butter coated paratha and savour the taste!  This place is it. They serve out of the world paratha. We tried aloo paratha and aloo onion paratha with butter milk which was served in kulhad(earthen cups) .. I had rate the ambience and the food excellent."
3.0,Visited this place with lots of expectations  But was not satisfied  Ordered  Paneer gravy - not good   Breads - not good   Paratha - good   Service really slow  Long way to go in improvement
4.5,Arguably the best punjabi food in bangalore. From paranthas to dal to sabzi everything tastes awesome and authentic punjabi. Ambiance is very basic and needs improvement. But one tends to overlook it due to the mouth watering food. I will highly recommend this place.
3.5,"Very Suffocating place to have food, not a good idea. Food quality is good. But Price is too high. Lassi is good could be little more chilled."
4.0,"Finally visited the place which was in my wish list from really long time. It's located inside the gurukul campus.we went for weekday lunch.This place was crowded but luckily we got a table without any wait. Service was quite fast. Now coming to food,Got masala papad as starter.we ordered 4 different combos which included- chole bhature,aloo pyaaz parantha,gobhi parantha,boondi raita,kheer,dry fruit lassi and shahi tukra. Chola bhatura was lil bit oily but tasty.parantha was the best loaded with butter. It was as big as plate size so think before u order .all the sweet dishes were awesome and delicious. Boondi raita tastes very plain. Over all a very good place for pujabi cusine veg food."
1.0,Awful place they cut onion right at your face and when you ask them politely not to do so.  They give an attitude which is rare and is not at all acceptable.  God knows why the place is so hyped.  A disgrace on the punjabis name.
3.5,"I still do not understand so much of fuss about this place. My review is based on my visit to this place twice. we ordered missi roti, kadhi, aloo paratha, Mushroom masala, Dal tadka, Makki ke roti, veg kadhai. All the dish I ordered was very normal, taste was not bad but it was not very good either. They had this extra butter and oil in everything which might have added extra taste to the food but there is nothing as such to go gaga about this restaurant. Even the price I felt was high as compared to place where the food comes with ambience. The only reason I can think of people liking this place so much is because they might be too tired after playing badminton and any food served than would taste good."
1.5,Had heard a lot about it and after being to this place I was really disappointed. It's highly overrated in zomato or maybe nothing else is better in that area. The cost is high compared to the quantity and except the song in the caf nothing felt like Punjabi style. The food does not taste that good and they know it that is they give chutney with it to add to some taste. I had gone for a yum Punjabi style paratha and thought that I would get nice curd with it but they give chutney instead which never made me feel like authentic Punjabi style neither their lassi. If you are in the area I don't think so you have a choice but there are many places to get those yum parathas
1.5,"This place in two words is ""SIMPLY OVERRATED"". I was so excited to go there after reading such good reviews. It was packed and had to wait for 15 odd minutes which raised the expectations all the more. Staff - Courteous but unhelpful. Which means FAKE courtesy. Food - Below average on the whole Ambiance - I dont care much, but for people who do - Nevermind! I ordered Paneer Degchi Dilliwale, Khasta Paratha, phulkas, Aloo paratha, Dal makhni bowl.  While waiting for food, if I asked if I can change the order from Khasta paratha to Aloo paratha, but the waiter said - NO its already ready. After that I waited for 20 minutes for my food to arrive. If it was ready, then why should I wait so much, if not, then please consider my request :-X  Coming to the food, the phulkas are better at Gurudwaras. Full of flour powder, dry, they were in all shapes and sizes, maps ranging from South America to Asia. If you are weak at geography, must try their phulkas! The staff was NOT sorry at this at all. The Khasta paratha, ZOMATO - PLEASE REMOVE THIS FROM THE RECOMMENDED DISHES. It is one of the most terrible piece of bread I have had at that price. It tasted as if I was having raw dough, which was toasted a little (do hell with properly cooking the paratha). I reported this to the waiters and all they said that ""Khasta paratha is like this only"". Waaow, now I know Kapoor's Cafe is like this only! Coming to the another talked about special dish of theirs - Paneer Degchi Delliwale - well looks like an indian flag with artificial colors painted on paneer. If I pay that much and the restaurant ambiance is of a roadside shop, I expect quality of food to be really high. Not some colored crushed paneer to decorate the dish. Coming to the taste - when asked to the waiters to explain the dish, at first couple of them could not explain, then another lad came and said ""You get spicy sweet and sour - Sir 3 flavors"". I thought it would be tangy n sweet like shahi paneer, but it was some random masala and absolutely SWEEEEET. It was not tangy at all. My spice quotient is not very high and I like mild spiced food but not my point is maincourse should not taste like something between maincourse and desert. While ordering they said it would be cashew gravy, but it tasted nothing like that.  Aloo paratha and Dal makhani were alright and 1.5 marks are for the SAME.  A feather to their cap - I could see a RAT behind the window (it was outside but very visibly struggling through the window as you dig into your food). Was as big as a goose.  I dont know there is something wrong with me or the fans who have given such high rating. May be it was my bad day.  But, overall I could sense the pompous attitude of staff and management which they might have achieved over the past months serving good food, but I hope this could help them as a reality check!  Will I go back? If the answer matters then - NO.  My hunch is the management has stopped looking at any critical feedback anyway!"
5.0,"Felt very satisfied after an hungry morning. Amazing food quality and such a fantastic match to the Punjabi cuisine. We had #VegParatha :: Perfect blend of all the vegetable, they were stuffed generously and a large chunk of desi butter to add more yumm factor to it. #PaneerParatha :: Roasted to perfection with butter. VERY GOOD ON TASTE. Prefer the stuffing you enjoy the most. My suggestion try #paneer & #mixveg. #MalaiKofta :: The best of all the malai kofta I have tried in Bangalore. Thumbs Up. Large chunk of koftas, 2 in number dipped in a creamy and slight sweet-ish gravy. And slight raw cream added to the presentation. #DryFruitLassi :: To end this amazing lunch, we ordered the Lassi. Served in small Matkas. They were so smooth, rely malai wali lassi with loads of dry fruits. Must Visit, despite being a NonVeggie, I strongly recommed this place.                                                                 instagram.com"
4.5,"Amazing food and to top it up some superb service. Very polite service staff. Must haves : Lassi, Khaasta Paratha & Kadhai Paneer. Must visit for all veggies and once in a while for Non V's."
4.0,"The milestone at the entrance an says its all!!!!  With the growing number of restaurants in the neighbourhood, self proclaimed Punjabi restaurants, this one stands out from the rest. The makhan takes you to the pleasant fields of Punjab.. I might be exaggerating a bit, but after having the triple cheese paratha, any one would. The lassi is one of the best you would find, the lassi at chulla chowki comes close. The menu and the parathas are authentic Punjabi styled and looks and tastes fantastic. The menu design is commendable and worth mentioning. The combos are a little unorthodox with their pricing, could have been a little more reasonable. A place with good food and service, it lacks creativity, when it comes to the ambience. The hygiene can be improved, with cleaner plates and a cleaner kitchen. Worth going if you savour the taste of Punjabi food. A little over hyped, but it just lives upto your expectations."
4.5,"Bulle Shah penned 'Bullah Ki Jaana"" which was rocked by Rabbi Shergill at Kapoor's Cafe, the troupe of which managed to pull the strings of my heart and gut on every single visit. Took me 4 visits to describe the sensational experience(s) at Kapoor's Cafe!   When the grub is this good, there really is no need to delve into the unnecessary aspects like location and ambience or any such tomfoolery. Always running a full house, Kapoor's is like one of those sons that never disappoints, ever. Be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, Kapoor's Cafe attracts so many hungry Punjabis and non-Punjabis, it's almost reminiscent of a Langar. With its modest pricing and the presence of a classic grotto-like shrine complete with an efficacious burning 'diya', Kapoor's Cafe can very well pass for a Langar.   Dishing out only vegetarian Punjabi cuisine, KC has crafted a scrupulous menu. Not one thing on the menu is unperturbed by its quagmire location or the lack of finesse in dcor. The patrons, the staff and the owners - form a strangely pleasant camaraderie within the walls of Kapoor's Cafe. I have witnessed an elderly gentleman being Heimliched by one from the staff when the former choked on a piece of something. And the restaurant packed to the gills stopped mid-meal, staff and patrons alike, ready to help if need be. Such bonhomie can only be achieved over something so pedestrian as food. :)   Consistent, fresh, bona fide Punjabi lip-smackers and fire-starters - these are the offerings at Kapoor's Cafe. Absolute out-of-the-park are the Dry Aloo Jeera, the French Fries Punjabi Style and the Gobi Paratha. Brilliant is the mind that came up with the Punjabi Fries. The Lassi served in earthen pots is the reason KC is frequented by the multitudes. That and everything else on the menu.   A brazen dollop of white butter makes an appearance on a hearty big paratha, a rivulet of fresh cream runs through the striking colours of the succulent kadai paneer, a waft of aroma arises out of the daal like a genie from a bottle, a sizzling hiss is heard when dipping hot pakodas in the cool mint chutney and inevitably, there is a drool. The rotis are soft, as should be, the parathas are big, as should be, the paneer is perky, as should be and the dals are silken, as should be. There has not been a single item on the menu that has ever disappointed me.   The steel plates, also much reminiscent of a Langar, add to the bucolic charm of Kapoor's Cafe. The ever-smiling Junior Kapoors run the place so efficiently amidst all the thronging office-goers and screaming children and yet never forget to smile charmingly on your way out or in. The senior Kapoor sums up the total amount to be paid without a computer, it's all hand-written and brain-garnered. The ""dhaba"" feel is complete with the helping of sweet saunf (sugar-coated fennel seeds) once you pay. :) Speaking of dhabas, I wonder if the truckers on the road also feel the need to lay down for a shuteye after such a sonorous meal. Maybe that's why they have those charpoys at dhabas.   Not only is vegetarianism celebrated here, but also the humble yet bountiful flavours of Punjab make a lasting impression on the taste buds. The kitchen works like a well-oiled machine, the serving and seating staff are energetic and attentive, the food is fresh and the whole experience is singular. Yes, less money can also buy you happiness."
5.0,"I am actually short of words to write a review for Kapoor`s cafe dry fruit lassi. It is a must try for all with the sweet tooth and also for those who dont like lassi`s much. Believe me you would fall in love with lassi`s. I have ordered dry fruit lassi specially many times from here, and I must say they also have a very fast order delivery service. In all, 5/5 for kapoor`s for this :)"
4.0,Heard a lot about this place and finally decided to give a visit after a huge traffic ..and it was worth it..the lassi was the best...paneer was kind of OKAY....dhabe ki daal was yummy and there parathas were too good.
5.0,Me and my friends thought of some tasty food for lunch we look for some and finally decided Kapoor's cafe we order 2 plates of chole bhature and 2 lassi.The taste for both was wow planning to visit again.
4.5,"OMG! Finally visited the Kapoor's Caf... Not like the first time I tasted the food :P The location... It's easily invisible treasure... Well for the ambience, They have colorful interiors with the dhaba look. Waited for like an hour to enter, but the wait was worth it. The have a rustic look and the plates they serve in are authentic. Now some food for thought. Go with a starved stomach. And you will relish the effort that goes into every dish. The portions are big enough and the prices are by far reasonable. The staff, Kapoor and sons doa wonderful job. We ordered Triple cheese parantha. Which has gooey cheese melting into your mouth. The masala curd has the spices in the right amount with a dash of mint leaves rendering it an authentic taste. We also ordered Paneer lababdar, which was a nice paneer gravy with huge chuncks of paneer. I wish the flavours had sunken into the paneer. the paneer tasted blant. Then there was their signature aloo paratha with huge dallops of butter. The mixed parantha again had a good taste. The lassi they give in matkas are a meal by themselves. Go here to get stuffed and hangout :D I love their food and ambience to the fullest :) Will recommend and revisit :)"
3.5,"We started with some chaas served chilled in little matkas, perfect for cooling off in the summer heat. The cheese paratha is a delight for those who love cheese. The dal makhini and gobi is great too. All this in pocket friendly rates. But i did find the place to be slightly over hyped cuz the ambiance is very average."
3.0,did not live up to hype.  Baked kulcha was nothing but a piece of half baked bakery style bread. Palak corn lacked any flavor. ALU parota was very ordinary with a large piece of butter. Lassi was crappy but came in a kullad and chaas was run down and ordinary. Definitely not worth the price.  Not sure if Sunday afternoon is the best time to visit any restaurant. Choking with ppl and waiters running around. Crappy service.  Sure is a super hyped up place. Probably because there is not another half decent place in this locality.
4.5,"Its a bit hard to locate, but trust me, if you're looking for some mast punjabi food at a cheap rate, this is the place.  From their plush aloo parathas with a dollop of butter on top to the paneer lababdar. Every item will make you drool just at the sight of it.  And the people have such good hospitality. Even for such a small dhaba, they will give you a warm welcome. And impeccable service.  I must give a 4.5."
5.0,"Craving for dal makhni and rice... go to zomato ask for options... one of the result was Kapoor's cafe... this immediately reminded me of movie kapoor and sons. So done deal we are visiting this place on a busy Saturday night. I cald up the place to block 2 seats and they said its all walk in no reservations. But the surprising factor comes in when i told him my wife is expecting and the guy ( i believe hes the one who sits at final counter) immediately says sir your waitlist number is 1. Come over any time. True customer centricity. We started with chhas served in kullhar (small little pots made of mud). For the main course we asked for one khasta paratha (4 layered wheat paratha), tawa roti, paneer lababdar and dal makhni with jeera rice. Khasta paratha was a recommendation item and it lived upto the expectation. Paneer lababdar was thick tomato based gravy good enuf for 4 people. And dal makhni tasted nice with jeera rice. Dal was cooked aptly with all ingredients in right proportion. Overall good experience. Place is a typical punjabi style with colorful roof top and happy n bubbly staff. I certainly look fwd to revisiting this place may be with larger set of audience. There is a very famous saying by John Willard Marriott... keep your associates happy they will keep you guests happy and your cash register will keep on ringing. Job well done guys. @ankita sinha"
3.0,food quality was ok.  not so great. As per quality of food and ambitions prices are bit high.  i ordered Lassi which is USP of this restro but it did not meet the expectation.
4.0,"If you wanna feel the ""Punjabi Dhaba Experience"" go for it. The parathas especially the cheese filled along with lassi is mouth watering.If you are in a mood to have North Indian food like Dal Makhni, different paneer gravy's and roti's, i recommend this place. The ambience is ordinary (dhaba style table & chairs). Service is good except on a very crowded evenings."
4.5,"Hands down! Best punjabi khana I've had in bangalore. Paneer has never tasted so delicious. One should surely try their value for money combos. Also, the lassi is a must at kapoor's. The staff is very friendly and cooperative too. And to top it all, awesome punjabi music to sing along to. Would love to go back again!"
5.0,This is just wow... Had osm Jain food n great rice I have never ever had in Bangalore. Many Jain variety like paneer sabji.. Starters.. Rice. Must visit
4.0,"There are some places we come across some places by absolute luck.  And then you start to wonder that how come you have not visited such a lovely place thats been around for a while.  You then think that it was a mere coincidence and convince yourself.  Well, I guess that is the feeling I got when I visit the lovely Vegetarian Restaurant serving some lovely North Indian Food named Kapoors Caf.    Background  Returning from a wonderful Holi Party is quite stressful.  And then when it involves enjoying with friends and also drinking, it is more tiresome.  But then when the set of friends say that we should try food at a place.  Initial reaction was that why did they suggest the place now.  But then I gather all the energy and say that why not give it a shot to actually try the restaurant.  It simply amazed me when I realised that I have visited the in and around this place before.  Its the same place where there is a great Badminton Club.  Now, the compound also houses the lovely restaurant.    And as I hear from the person running the restaurant, it is family business where parents and brothers are completely involved. It ought to be great coz there is so much of love involved.  Location  If you are heading to Value Forum Mall from Maratahalli, you need to drive across to the signal called Kundanahalli Gate. Then keep driving straight at signal for another  kms.  The restaurant is located to the left side inside the same complex where the Badminton Club is situated.  Ambiance  The place is unique in itself which makes it very interesting.  I need to share more thought on it.  Roof looks to be like the thatched roof or say like the asbestos sheet.  I hear that the family was involved in painting it.  There are wonderful chairs and dcor around the place which gives a soothing feeling.  Huge desert cooler to keep the location cool.  Usage of contemporary coolers or A/C have been avoided to keep it natural.  There is meter post outside just like the way you find on the highway indicating the distance to the place.  Here there is one that says  PUNJAB 0 KM.  There are great posted on the walls.   Like  11 Fun Facts About Punjabis, HELL IM PUNJABI, OK CALM CALM, Punjabi Diet Plan, Village scenes.  Small board that says  SPEED LIMIT 180 KMs per HOUR.   The reasons I mentioned above are quite great and I feel I already going there once again.  Food  Any restaurant that starts off, has the initial craze with the customers coz its new.  And it became older, it is important to let the same customers come back.  It should also attract new people coz they would have heard from other friends who visited the place in the past.  This for sure is the reason for the increase in popularity of Kapoors Caf.  Let me share my thoughts.  Holi Mini  Thali  Thandai  Traditional drink is prepared for Holi and everyone gets to drink. This drink was available and being served as part of Holi food.  The taste was so much better.  It is not just the cold milk, but the ingredients that enhance the flavour and the Earthen pot in which is it served.  Paapad + Masala (Paapad Roll)  This is the paapad rolled like a cone and stuffing put into it.  The stuffing is that of tomato, onions, coriander and masalas.  I thought initially that it was good but then felt that it was on the spicier side.  But yes it is quite unique coz I have not tried it anywhere in the recent past.  Paneer Kebab  This was a Paneer of which kebab was made.  It was quite soft and tasted yummy with the mint chutney.  Thali Content  Subjis  Aloo Gobi (dry), Paneer Mutter Masala, Lauki (Gourd) curry  The taste of all the subjis were simply brilliant.  It was great trying that with the thick paranthas which actually seemed to kachori.  There was not much oil that was used in the subjis.  The spices were also quite optimum for every to enjoy it.  Raita  This was a great addition to the thali which in south India is common.  It tasted good with the rice-bath.  Pulao  There was a small portion of it served which tasted quite good with the curries with the gravy.  Sweet  It seemed to look like Balu shah but it isnt.  The taste might have been a little on sweeter side.  But yes it was something I could not resist soon after I started eating.  Paan  They made sure that paan is served in the plate.  So, soon after finishing meal, you can pick it up instead of taking it anywhere from outside.  Drinks  Masala Tea  I decided to try some Masala tea before calling quits for the day.  The taste was quite wonderful with the optimum mix of milk, tea and sugar.  Apart from the above mentioned, I did take back few items to home like  Paneer Butter Masala and 6-Daal Curry.  Paneer Butter Masala had a bit of masala which made a light spicy dish. But the overall dish was good.  6-Daal Curry was having the combination of 6 different pulses. And yes the taste was simply wonderful.  Khasta Paratha is something that most of my friend have advised me to take when I go there.  I tried and for sure it tasted wonderful with the 6-Daal Curry.  Overall Experience  This was a wonderful evening spent time at a new restaurant.  Ambiance is wonderful and I feel that people can feel relaxed just being there.  The owner of restaurant actually goes to every table with guests and speak to them.  It speaks so much about the desire to connect people.  The food has had few glitches in spices but I am sure it can be improved.  My current rating for this place is 4.0/5.  It has all the potential to grow up in the ratings.   My rating in other departments.  Food  4.0/5  Ambiance  4.0/5  Service  4.0/5  Drinks  4.0/5  Food for 2 will coast anywhere between 1200-2000 depending on hunger.                                             fodyssey.com"
3.5,The ambiance here is really good. like the place very much. the paneer pakora's are really yummy. the food would be awsome if it had a little less oil in it. but yea the tastes really good. the dry fruit lassi is one of my favroits has it has a really fresh flavour to it.

3.0,Ordered kachori and aaloo puri since I was so not in the mood to turn any kind of meal on my own. The food arrived quite hot and prompt. Liked the udad dal kachodis and the puris too were decent though my heart thumped with a heavy sigh looking at the oil floating in the aaloo curry. The food tasted good but I would so much prefer less oilier versions but for the non-conscious the food tasted decent and would recommend trying. It does seem to have the north indian flair to it.
4.5,Do not judge the book by its cover. The hotel is located in a kinda deserted area in the mid of kundalahalli. The place doesn't look that good and it is in an interior place. But as I said in the beginning do not judge the book by its cover. Once u step into it....woah....u enter a while new different atmosphere....u are welcomed by the punjabi music and also the aroma. The food needless to say is simply superb. No Hi fi menu. Simple dishes yet grandly made. The richness of butter....The quality of the paranthas.....The delicious desserts....an complete package. What abt the service and the speed of delivery. Well even that is done is a very good manner. All In all an amazing place to be. For food....For service and for the music.
4.0,"We'd been craving a dhaba like experience near Bangalore for a while now and when I found this little gem under 10 kms away, I couldn't believe my luck. The ambience is a perfect blend of a dhabaesque setup with the modern amenities of coolers and a credit card machine . I by no stretch of the imagination claim to be a North Indian cuisine conneiseur, but the food was a mix of absolute delight and just wanting a little more. We ordered the dry fruit lassi (absolutely heavenly), assorted pakoras (so -so) with Mushroom curry and Khasta paratha(still undecided if it was good or great). The food definitely had a home/dhaba cooked feel to it and the proportions were bang on perfect. Best part though was the absolute tinkle it gave the credit card as compared to the other joints in the area."
4.0,I have been here quite a number of times. The food is great and tastes very homely. But it's very expensive to come twice in the same month.
1.0,Poor quality food what we ordered online and what they offer in dine in is totally diff quality. Plz be aware while placing online do not order online
4.5,"It's a small little vegetarian place in Whitefield ,food is v v tasty and has the rich Punjabi flavours.It's generously covered with ghee so for diet conscious people beware.It's the ultimate Punjabi indulgence. It has a low key dhaba like ambience which might not be liked a lot by the hygiene lovers.The pickled chilli with onion is a v yum side to go with traditional north Indian dhaba daal and aloo jeera,don't forget to order the roasted papad it's so crunchy and perfect thali combo.  Food 5/5 Ambience 3.5/5 Service 4/5"
4.5,"If you are looking for a place to taste authentic Punjabi paranthas in, this is the place for you. Totally loved the food. Paranthas, Channa Bhatura are mind-blowing here. So are the Lassis. Great service."
2.5,"I reached the place with high hopes after reading so many positive reviews. But the food quality was no where near the reviews posted here.  We  ordered for tawa fulka.  Half baked would be an overrating! It had all dry dough on it.. Really!!!  I, being an amateur, sure can make better rotis than you.  The roti was simply unchewable after 5 mins.  One of the reviews here recommended for khasta paratha which was equally disastrous.  Seemed like it was a simple thing. Just make a paratha and paste ajjwain to it. So much of that it becomes bitter.  Then it was turn of rice. We order for paneer pulao. When i order for pulao,  i expect it to be cooked properly with veggies. It was nothing more than ghee rice with paneer added to it. Still it seemed like the best of lot!!   We really had a bad experience with food and not going there next time.  Really wondering if the chef was just having a bad day or how did people liked the food.!!!"
4.0,A vegetarian Punjabi restaurant with homely food. But definitely need to check on oil. The food was generally very oily.  However that makes up with the service. A very family running the show - go away beyond on customer service.
2.5,"I am surprised many people wrote this place is pocket friendly and hygienic and basically it is neither of them. I felt a dhaba  kind of experience where the food is oily and the place is noisy and cluttered with rats roaming arnd. Aloo parAtha tasted good but too oily, kadai paneer was whoozing oil or butter what ever it was,  was not good, chilli -onion parAtha just tasted of azwain and nothing else. Yes! the service was prompt and I walked out that place with irritation in my throat after eating the oily food."
1.0,"This place is so overrated  Went 3 times after Gurukul sessions, had consistently bad experience  According to me, this is just a place to hangout with bachelor friends, not a family eating place at all. Also, the photo you see in the cover of this restaurant is not how it is, it has iron chairs with black granite top table like you see in normal darshini hotels  I request zomato to come up with definitions for Restaurants, Darshinis etc., and put this under darshini category (Even then this is not a good place as cost is way way high) Ambience :  - This restaurant simply given fake reviews, reality is bad, No proper roof, its a metal roof (for the money they charge its not a good ambience)  - Poorly maintained, not enough parking place, not even a proper well lit board, dark area, females scared to enter the place alone  - No proper chairs, tables keep shaking and spills your drinks, the 2 seater table very small and they will force you to sit on 2 seater if you are only 2, even on a weekday they won't give you 4 seater  - There is no proper hand wash & restroom too, you have to pass through ladies rest room to wash your hands (because male often does not work)  Service : - Ok but not really nice, except at door there is only one service guy inside, you have to literally wait for the guy to finish other tables before ur turn comes - The serving boys are fine though, they do good job  Food : - not great as the reviews say, people who have rated the taste really have not eaten in good places or its fake - except few specific dishes, taste is Okay not bad, if your luck is bad you will get through spoiled curry, they changed twice for me (simple veg kadai) - no much varieties in starter, drink - only thing they have are paratas, paratas, paratas and they are costly or unhealthily rich with butter  Cost: Considering all the above, the cost they charge is really really too much, how can a humble aloo parata cost Rs. 80? and the Lassi they given half cup for Rs. 40, which outside you get it in patiala peg :-) all starters starts at 120 Rs. and they given tiny quantity  PS: I normally do not rate or review , i only review if hype vs reality is really big gap, this one really prompted me to review"
4.0,"Coming from a place like Hyderabad, where people worship food and the taste it has to offer, I decided to visit Kapoor's Cafe, based on its reviews and an interesting Punjabi VEGETARIAN menu. 1) The place seems to have ample parking space and has nice signage on the main road. 2) This place pulls it of with its food to get a 4 rating with a very average Dhaba like ambience.  3) If you're planning to visit do not forget to try the CHAAS and DRY FRUIT LASSI. It's been really long since I had a lassi like this. 4) Tried the following items:       a) Dhabi ki dal.  9/10       b) Dal makhani.  9.5/10       c) Fulka with desi ghee.  10/10       d) Chole.  8/10       e) Masala papad.  9/10        f) Assorted pakoras. 7/10        g) Khasta paratha.  7/10        h) Chaas.  8/10         i) Dry fruit lassi.  9/10         j) Fruit cream.  9/10"
5.0,"Fantastic food! I heard a lot of good things about this place from friends and decided to experience it last weekend. Despite having 50+ seating capacity, we had to wait for 40min.. & there were few more in the waiting list behind us. and tats a good sign, aint it?. Absolutely loved paneer paratha, lassi, dal makhani :) Nice DHABA-like ambience & great service. Despite being extremely busy, a friendly Mr. Kapoor managed to spend some time with us to seek our feedback. Great work Mr. Kapoor. keep up the good work and I will visit you often..cheers! :)"
3.5,A lot was heard about this place but just didn't live up to the hype. So we ordered Lassi (must try) and poori chole which was very average. But yeah considering no one else seems to offer this in Bangalore so for North Indians like me this might not be 'the place' but then something's better than nothing. Hopefully the 2nd experience would be better.
4.5,"One of my most favourite eatery in Whitefield. I have visited Kapoor's a couple of times and they have never let me down with their food. Be it the rotis or the dal or the subji, the food is yummy and cooked to perfection. The only tiny problem I have is some of the dishes like Pindi Cholle can be quite oily keeping in line with the Delhi cuisine. So if you like greasy food, then this place is a haven. Even otherwise there are plenty of other dishes that are well balanced. The restaurant has a dhaba feel and the decor is spartan. The pricing is quite reasonable and worth the money."
5.0,"Yummy food.... Felt like home... Great hospitality, pampering with delicious paranthas... What else you need on a Sunday eve...;)  Loved the place totally... Kudos to the owner and entire team...!"
4.5,"Among a lot of restaurants which claims to serve authentic punjabi food, after visiting here multiple times, authenticity is definitely in their menu. I have seen how this place turned from a simple interior with handmade art works hanging on the walls to a very famous north Indian dine in. One thing which never changed is the sweetness in their service and quality of their food. Aloo, gobi, mixed, cheese be it be any parathas they have it all. These parathas are large and overloaded butter topping can be lethal if your on diet. Be cautious to inform them beforehand if you are watching your calories. Lassi is served in small earthen pots and will definitely make you order more. The cheese paratha is almost like our own desi pizza. The punjabi fries has a unique but real nice taste. it's garnished with coriander leaves and combined with masala. Dal Makhni, paneer butter masala, aloo jeera, kadai paneer are some of the things to be ordered. They also have combos. No service charges are levied on the bill and you can feel free to put your contributions in the small box which is placed at the cash counter. Definitely worth the money and a second visit is must.                                             myhungertales.wordpress.com"
4.0,"Kapoor's Cafe is a favourite for us. The hubby and I make it a point to visit this place if we are on that side of the town. Instant gratification for paratha cravings. They make delicious parathas . The parathas are served hot with melting butter on them and green chutney. Thick and yummy lassi served in kulhads. A single paratha and a lassi and you would mostly be left feeling full :-) We rarely visit veg only restaurants, but this is an exception. The courteous owners have always been present at the restaurant when we visited. Service during peak hours is sluggish but overall its a must visit place."
3.5,"A very hyped place according me.. Yes, their paranthas and lassi are great but everything else is just average. I find it a bit expensive considering the ambience and service.."
2.5,"My first  restaurant in bangalore and a bad experience. Parathas didnt take like one, the lassi was too sweet and quiet uselessly it costed us rs200 per person."
4.0,"Be here if you have north food cravings. Absolute treat for a vegetarian, you can't stop going back. we went out there for lunch had Parothas, Paneer, baked kulcha, lassi, mixed veg starter. Ambience is not that comfortable, there were power cuts and ventilation was not enough. overall it's good experience after having food there."
5.0,"Amazing hotel... Should give a try here.. Fruit cream, lassi, corn masala, ghee fulka... Should try these items .... Its always rush.. Make a point you go early on weekends!!!"
4.0,"After reading great reviews about this restaurant, I thought of exploring this place without any further delay. Not even one and half year old, this place is quite famous among all North Indians in the city.  Visited there on one Saturday night and the place was packed. They have enough parking place. The owner himself was standing out and noting the names for the wait list. We were fortunate to get a table in 15 mins.   The place is more like a modern style Dhaba with Bollywood and Punjabi music playing at the background. Service was pathetic. Had to  remind the waiters  5-6 times to get glass, spoons and nobody bothered to attend the requirement immediately. Need to improve a lot on this.  Coming to food, it was a delightful experience.  We started with Dry Fruit Lassi, Butter Milk and Masala Papad. Dry Fruit Lassi was yummy and heavy. Dhabe Ka Daal was great. Khasta Paratha is a must try. Even Mix Paratha was nice. The food here really reminded me the food from Delhi and Punjabi. Authentic taste and quality. The only sad part is that they don't serve Non-veg :( . But a pure non-vegetarian like me won't repent going there.  A great place to relish great food."
5.0,"Greaaaaattttt place, food is like it is going to be heaven!! It's the place I will go ... Cheers and kudos to the team!  Each time I come here, they touch my soul with their great food!!"
4.0,"Kapoors cafe was on the list to eat but never got the opportunity or time to come eat here. Yes, it might sound like I'm traveling to another state but if you know a little about Bangalore, you know I'm right. Being in the area and hunting for lunch, I locked on kapoors cafe and made the journey to kapoors cafe. At first, google maps warned me that it might be closed by the time I reached. A bit disappointed, I check again and they were open. Google maps was right thought. They used to shut after 3 earlier. Now they are open till later. Walked in. Super friendly as well. Phone was dead. Asked if I could charge my phone. They kindly obliged and gave me a port. Most restaurants would've passed the not our responsibility comment. But they were nice about it. My colleagues and I ordered quite a bit as we were super famished. 3 paneer paranthas, 2 aloo paranthas, dal makhani, boondi raita and some paneer pakodas. And godamn, was the service quick. The paneer paranthas came quicker than the aloo paranthas. But they were worth the wait. When the paranthas did arrive, we just gasped at the amount of butter that was spread on it! Illegal! My colleague commented. We dived right into it. The dal makhani was so good. The chass which I got was served in a small matka. Nice touch. Both paranthas were on point. Such a heavy and satisfying lunch. I didn't have such simple and good North Indian food in so long. The interior was also nice. They had put effort into making the whole place a little more lively. Really loved the food and experience here. Although, I'm not sure if I would travel this far for the food again. Maybe for the dal makhani. If I was in the area, I would totally just be flocking it. Go and check it out. And indulge in some really tasty food."
5.0,"With a desi Punjabi setup, this place satisfies your craving of good food. The parathas here are to die for. I have visited this place quite a few times and was never disappointed. Although the minimum waiting time that I got here was 45 minutes, but it is worth the wait."
1.5,"I have been there for several of times. They served well, food was so yummy. But last time I ordered Paneer Bhurzi and it contained some soil and particles of sand.  Spoiled mood and money too. :( :( :( :( :("
5.0,Food Quality is very good and pocket friendly.. Tripple cheese paratha were amazing..kullad lassi..aloo pyaaz pakode..kalmi punjabi sticks must try...
3.5,Its great place to visit with friends the parantha were deleciously awesome esp cheese paratha 4 layers is the best we had . The ambiance of the place is very good but the food is slightly overpriced and less in quantity which makes me rate 3.5/5
4.0,"Good place, good food, extremely overcrowded on weekends, quick service, reasonable rates..overall a perfect pitstop to treat ur taste buds and butterflies."
3.5,"It's not the fanciest place to be at but when you have cravings for Punjaabi parathas, I vouch for this place.  Try their signature Aloo parathas and dry fruit lassi.The parathas do have a lot of chillis in them and the dahi helps ease the heat. The dry fruit lassi also helps cool you down too.  Kapoor's cafe is a great place of team lunches on a budget. A meal will not cost you more than 150 a head."
4.0,"I usually never like vegetarian food. This is one vegetarian joint I will definitely take an effort going to. The food is just top notch. The parathas, the kulchas and the lip smacking curries and top it off with chaas or lassi. Makes me wanna hit the dhabas in punjab every time I eat here."
4.0,Has a simple but nice ambience. Does justice to one's taste buds and yes the most important thing is that its pretty pocket friendly. Recommended.
3.5,Been here 7 to 8 times. Me and my brother tried almost tried everything. Lassie and paratha as it's best. Ambiance and service is standard. Must visit in Whitefield locality.
4.0,"Visited this place with some college friends. It was decided to leave the place of dinner selection for the friends who work in Whitefield & they picked Kapoor's. There was enough parking space for our bikes & car, but then it was on a wednesday, so don't know about weekends. The interiors were simple & most of the patrons were working crowd who were there for dinner. We didn't order any starters as they looked simple, but after reading the reviews I am truly repenting it. We all ordered the paranthas on our friend's suggestion.  PARANTHAS: we ordered 1 triple cheese parantha, 2 mix paranthas, 1 onion parantha. All of them were served with a big, fat mound of butter. That's seriously heavy & rich food. The paranthas are served with mint chutney, which was alright. But we also ordered the Kadai mushroom to go with. Having been to parantha Plaza in Sanjayanagar a lot, I have always wondered if there might be some place in Bengaluru that would be good enough. Looks like Kapoor's does. The paranthas were good, with all of us liking the triple cheese parantha. The 3 types of cheese gave it a rich, creamy & very delicious flavor. But I also suggest the mix parantha, especially for those who are tired of aloo & onion. PORTION: very heavy for one person, if you have ordered any starter. Order their awesome phulkas if you want more.  Phulkas: I wanted to try more paranthas, so went ahead & ordered an onion parantha. But my friend recommended the phulkas which the others chose. It was soft as it was meant to be & went well with the Kadai mushroom. PORTION: order along with paranthas. If you aren't that hungry, then 2 should suffice.  Kadai Mushroom: I ordered this as I was bored of panner. The mushrooms were big & the quantity of one was large enough for us. The gravy tasted well, but went better with the phulkas rather than paranthas. Would recommend it if you like a lot of mushrooms. PORTION: One dish was enough for 5 paranthas & 2 phulkas, but only because we also had the mint chutney, achaar etc. But the quantity was a lot.  Chaas: it's the very first time I am having this, as I always chose lime soda or Lassi for Punjabi food. My friend convinced me to order this & I don't regret it. It was served in matka & was chilled & light on the stomach. Definitely recommend it if you don't like Lassi. PORTION: Just perfect for one.  Overall, I would go back to this place to try their thalis. A great place worth visiting more often."
4.5,"It was my first visit here and was suggested by some friend and am I not happy that they did so. The food, service and the ambience was really good. The portions were big, and I mean really BIG and heavy. I ordered lassi, parathas,kheer and some fries. Everything was really tasty but the kheer was simply brilliant. I don't remember many restaurants serving this kind of tasty kheer. Even the parathas reminded me of the ""parathe wali gali ""in Delhi.  I would suggest everyone to atleast try this cafe and be your own judge."
4.0,"Yummy!!!!Finger licking,good food!!!!Chole Bhatura is a must try!!!!Courteous staff... We tried the Kadai Paneer Combo too, haven't had better Kadai Paneer than this anywhere else!!!"
4.5,"It is my All Time Favorite GO TO place. Everything falls in perfectly at this very place. It is pocket friendly, has rustic Dhaba like feel and the most important is- Completely satiates my PUNJU taste buds.   We basically are huge fans of their Paranthas. Aloo Pyaaz, Gobhi n Pyaaz Paranthas will surely make you nostalgic and miss your mom a lot. Dal Makhani and Panner dishes are undoubtedly a must have. Do try their lassi n Chaas to digest the Calorie laden, butter smeared Parathas.  This place is heavily crowded on weekends that might make you wait foreven half an hour or so at peak timings."
3.5,No frills place. Food is good. However quantity served is less. Had ordered kachori aloo for breakfast. But along with 4 pooris only 2 small pieces of aloo were served and we had to order extra aloo for which we were charged separately.
2.0,"Not sure, why this guy gets a 4+ rating, have seen tons of other punjabi restaurants with better food and better ambience. Sure, the pricing seems decent but to what extent, the dishes have more gravy than actual food so clearly they are skimping of adding value there for a weekend lunch. The place is a glorified shed with sweaty long line of tables and elbow rubbing space with next table as ambience so you know privacy is already out the window.   Would like to see them improve the food, too spicy for me and my husband."
4.0,Great veggie place for a sumptuous delicious plate of paranthas. It's a low key chairs  and tables canteen kind of place. The paranthas would cost you about 100 for a plate. Service is average but the food comes quickly enough. A big thumbs up for the taste.
4.5,Visited #kapoors again and as expected had a great experience. The ambiance is simple yet great and the food is really tasty. It's worth mentioning that the portions are huge yet at a very affordable price. Worth a try for every food lover.
4.5,"Have been thrice to dis place on last one month and one word defines my experience : awesome. Triple layered Cheese parathas , chole bhature, French Fries all exceedes expectations. One suggestion - wenevr u go, don't forget to end ur meal wd Kulhad Lassi :D"
3.5,"We have been here after hearing Lot of good reviews. We have been there on Sunday and its too crowded. We got seat after 20mins.From outside restaurant looks like a small one. We have taken aloo parata,pulkas,assorted pakodas.Pakodas and rajma curry was good We are disappointed with lassi as it was  too sweet to drink. Good place to have north indian veg food"
5.0,"Really loved the food here. Totally in love with the cheese paratha. Just like how my mom makes. The food is so sumptuous and filling  Thanks for setting up this place Arpit. Must visit at least once a month.  Just one suggestion, plz introduce cold badam milk as well"

4.5,Wonderful place for lunch...Had triple cheese paratha in a combo along wid kheer n lassi...courteous staff...organized service in a short time...would recommend the cheese paratha which is really very heavy...lookin forward to visit it again very soon...
4.5,"Kamal da dhabha hai ji :D Although there is a little rush, but I'd say it's worth it wn u have ur first bite. Kullhad lassi nd chach are a must try. Indian masala fries also are unique cz of their pudhina toppings. Main course to kamaal da hi hai ji, tussi jao to sahi. Amazing experience, would surely reccomend."
2.5,"One should not give 5 ratings to a restaurant  for just its quality of food.   The quality is really good 5 out of 5 Ambiance and location is really bad 1 out of 5 Service is ok 3 out of 5  If you want to get the real punjabi taste then this is the one, but you shouldn't complain or ask about anything else.   I ordered parathas, they were really good and served with a good amount of butter. Lassi is just like a thick curd with sugar added into it."
3.0,A much hyped place...food wise it's normal..but you have to wait as there used to be a long queue.  May be it is popular because of the authenticity of the place.  Food : 3/5 Service : 3/5 Value for money: 3/5
5.0,"Great place, wanted to visit this place for a very long time and finally made it today! The food was great and tasty. Pure Veg only!! Don't miss the dry fruit lassi it's pure bliss!! A must visit place. You can butter every where you look!"
4.0,"Reach this place by 7, get a seat, keep ordering and eating till you feel more than full because if you don't, then boy you're gonna regret it.. A perfect parantha joint, not to mention the loads of white butter (evil laugh!!). Absolutely love this place. Fancy menu, polite staff. A true treat for every North Indian food lover! A 4 on 5!"
3.5,"Now this outlet has a contemporary take on north Indian food. The crowd that prefers to eat here is essentially the migrant population working for IT and missing home style food. This cafe is recently renovated [read painted]. So the new kapoors cafe has nothing new except the place is painted and started a punjabi rolls corner just outside the entrance.   Coming to the food, if you are in a big group it makes sense to order a couple of curries and breads but they have a lot of combo meal options to choose from. The food is very high on the spice quotient and its rather difficult to customize the food because its prepared in advance and only assembled on order.   So we ordered a roasted masala papad, mix veg paratha, a rajma meal combo, half a bowl of curd, sweet lassi and kheer for dessert.   The papad has crushed peppercorn so beware before you bite into the spice. The mix veg paratha comes with a really big chunk of butter & some spicy green chutney. This paratha is a must have. The sweet lassi and kheer which is loaded with dry fruits come in cute kullads and I must say both these items are heavenly. I can go to the extent of saying that I visit kapoors cafe only and only for the kheer.   Now this is a safe joint to take some one looking for authentic but really spicy north Indian food. If it were not so spicy, I would come here at least twice a month. Worth trying."
4.0,Heaven for parathas and starters. Fully veg. Good service from waiters. Forget the ambience. Had the best lassi in Bangalore. Enjoy Punjabi style dinner!!
3.5,"This is a proper veg. restaurant jut in front of the gurukul sports complex. The food is good and the price is in the upper mid range. Its clean and the staff is full dil wale Punjabi. Nothing outstanding about the place,yet its jam packed most of the time because of its clean and delicious food. For the veg lovers, i wont say its a paradise for you but yes its definitely an alternative!"
1.0,"A TOTAL WASTE !Unimpressive, poor service, over priced and over hyped.. That's exactly how I will define this place.  Coming to the food, the curry was bland and paratha was just ok.. Served with amul (yellow) butter, instead of white (mentioned in their menu). The roti was hard to break. The only good thing here was their Lassi.. Which is a must try if you visit this place ( I hope you don't ).  I somehow smell something fishy about the zomato rating too, as the food was worthless.. And I wonder how come they have such high rating. Had it only been a lassi corner, the rating was justified !!  P.S. - Do not visit if you are a punjabi or north Indian food lover.. it will spoil your taste buds !"
2.5,"First of all it was too hot in day time,there is no electricity...we were just sweating and eating.now if we talk about service, not good at all...now come to food, in main course we ordered paneer lababdar and kadai mushroom which was sweet in taste instead of spicy...Overall a bad experience :("
5.0,"I had heard a lot about the place and I finally had a chance to try it out. There is just one thing that I can compliment about the place : good food doesn't have to be a difficult combination of rare spices/ingredients and Kapoor's cafe just proves the point! We tried the following items : Paneer Degchi dilliwale - this is somewhat close to malai kofta in terms of gravy (which implies its a little sweet) but different in terms of the ample usage of cardamom and black pepper that leaves a long lasting taste in your mouth! It is a little overpriced but worth the try :)  Lassi - I was all bowled by the lassi. The creaminess and thickness of the curd was just right! I couldn't keep myself from 2 servings :D  Alu parantha - huge, sumptuous, neither too spicy nor lacking it (and overloaded with butter)! The mint chutney served along with it complements it the best!  Masala papad - it is a little too spicy but a very palatable Punjabi starter :)  We had ordered a jeera rice for take away and that was good too (they made that too in butter :P)"
4.0,"Parathas Parathas and Parathas, if that is what your mind is singing and if you are hungry and if you are near Whitefield, please go to this place.  Ambience is decent, but the service is very good, though if it's crowded then it will be hard to catch their attention.  I have tasted all their parathas, Cheese parathas - triple cheese is a must try and have.  Don't order their French fries, it's Punjabi fries and the masala is different, we didn't like it. Starters are good, but not great. If you are go on a weekend, be prepared to wait for 10-15 mins."
4.0,"First advice to all. Unless you come in early, expect to wait quite a while for a table especially if you are in a large group. The wait however is worth it. We however had to wait an hour more AFTER giving our orders. You can well imagine the rush. After waiting for so long even ordinary food seems tasty.  The decor is simplistic. They have tried to replicate the dhaba feeling of North India and have been moderately successful at it. For me the brass plates in dhabas have a different charm. Service expectedly crawls along at snail's pace.  The food however is simply awesome. Even simple Jeera rice and Daal fry is tasty. Loved their Aloo Gobi too. The Paneer Butter Masala was a tad too plain for my tastes. The show stopper however was the Lassi. Under no circumstances are you to leave this place without having lassi. Deliciously served in earthly matkas, they will leave you craving for more.  I can go as far as to say that this is one of the gems in Bangalore. Might not be an ideal eating out for the die hard non veg north Indian purists but for the vegetarians this is not a place to miss."
5.0,"Food Was awesome.!! In bangalore, proper North Indian food and want it in the budget then only one i say.. its Kapoor's Cafe.  Testy Parathas..!! Testy Food..!!   Must Must Must try once and you will love it."
2.5,I just have one question for the management ...!!!!!   WHY ARE YOUR PRICES SO DAMN HIGH?   1.Neither you have a great ambience. 2.You are not serving in gold or silver utensils. 3.Your food is also not that orgasmic.  4.You are not set up in any posh location. 5.Your service is also not that customer friendly.  6.Your food is also not coming from Punjab everyday ...so that you have to include transportation costs.  7. Half of your menu is unavailable.  8. Quantity of the food is also not that remarkable.   Still giving 2.5 for the Punjabi songs that you play.  The only thing that was in my mind when I came out was  WHY?
4.5,Lovely homely food... Its not a high quality ambience but when the food melts with butter ..u forget the ambience..  Great parathas.. N awesome food. Must try place
4.0,"Authentic veg dhaba food, dhaba ambience and dhaba experience! I tried the parathas and lassi here. All the parathas come with this huge dollop of butter... The lassis are served in these huge steel glasses... If you belong to north India and miss home... I highly recommend this place!  PS: it's very easy on the pocket!"
1.0,"We have ordered dal makhni, jeera rice. Dal makhni is completely like water n jeera rice the tasty is so pathetic. And on top of all this, I got the order almost after 60 minutes. The quantity of the food and price doesn't match at all. I visited this restaurant after seeing the rating but they don't live up to the rating they have."
3.0,"We went there on a weekend and the place was buzzing with the weekend crowd...ordered assorted pakoras expecting we'd get to taste one of each listed on the menu...but disappointingly it was a platter of onion and paneer pakoras...pakoras were fine. ..The khasta paratha, chilly onion khasta paratha were really tasty...so was the missi paratha...dal makhni and paneer degchi delliwale were yummy too...last but not the least the chaas and the lassi were amazing!! They serve them in cute little matkas!!"
4.5,"This place is a bit shabby but the food is definitely not. You can expect some heavy authentic punjabi food in here. I just love the cheese parathas with butter floating on the top. One thing is sure, you will never be disappointed upon trying something new be it the 'paneer pakoras' in the starters to the 'kheer' or 'fruit cream' in the desserts. You will have to wait in a queue if you reach the place after 7pm, it's better to call up and book a table 15 mins in advance. The waiting is generally very small for two people (just an observation)."
2.5,This place did not impress me at all. Not sure what the fuss is all about. This restaurant is just set up in like a garage space. Paratha are overly priced and they don't even taste that good. Maybe curries will be good but I am not sure if I want to return to this place to try them.
4.0,"Excellent food and very good service BUT.... saw big RATS playing around the coolers outside window(it was impossible for them to get in but still..) which you definitely dont want to see while eating such a Delicious food, service was very good and we often visit here, one of our favorite place for dinner!!  PS: one star can be earned only when that issue of rats is solved"
3.5,"I had punjabi food at punjabi dhabas, and at most of the places where punjabi food is offered in the city. But I found this place's food very close to Punjab true flavours. Lassi is really good. Don't miss it."
4.5,"It is a very typical college canteen setup but the food is outstanding. The parathas are good but chole bhature are even better. The service is quick. And it is not expensive,value for money."
4.5,"The best Punjabi Dhaba in Town ? It is this.  Butter laden Aalu parantha is simply the best. And so is the kadhai Paneer and Lassi. We also tried the Malai Kofta , which is decent too.  Had to wait for more than 30minutes to get in, but it's worth the wait. Ambience is akin to a typical dhaba, including the parking. The people are friendly too, even though they are super busy. A place I'd definitely go again. Highly recommended."
3.5,I love the variety paratas there. This cafe is very very generous in the amount of butter they add to the paratas. You might want to tell them not to put so much if you are on a diet. Otherwise lucky for those butter lovers !! Thick lassi is another speciality. Perfect punjabi food.
5.0,"Amazing food. The place was a little crowded. But we loved the Parathas, Naans and kheer. Great service too. And absolute value for the money we spent."
4.5,"Kapoor's cafe happened on a late Saturday afternoon. It's situated little interior on a road ahead of the kundanahalli gate towards Whitefield near Gurukul sports academy.It was bustling with people when we arrived. I had a brief chat with the owner (Arpit Kapoor)that morning and he was very welcoming on our arrival. After a short waiting time we were seated. A small place packed with people. No eye candy interiors to boast about. But loved the lively punjabi songs these guys played. We quickly ordered our food as we were starving literally. We ordered the famous paneer degchi dilliwalle , Chole bature, aloo pyaaz paratha and lassi.  To begin with lassi - it was one of the best I have had in recent times. It was thick and creamy and soul stirring. I loved it.  Next came the Chole bature which looked great and tasted even better. The paratha was the complete size of the plate in which it was served and I was shocked seeing the generous loading of a big blob of butter on it. The best thing about the paratha was that it had the stuffing until the edges of the paratha and tasted supreme with the chutney. But the show stealer was the paneer degchi dilliwalle which was one of the best preparations of paneer I have ever had. It was neither too spicy not too sweet but a perfect blend of the spices with a tinge of sweet. The paneer itself was soft and melted in the mouth. This dish was heavenly. We also took away two alu parathas which we had later at home and those also seemed good.  Overall this place is all about good food. Not heavy on pockets and you can eat a large and satisfying meal for a decent price. I am definitely coming back to try their other dishes.  Ambience - 3/5  Food - 5/5  Service - 4/5 Value for money - 4/5"
5.0,Yummy food. Punjab in the food. Most friendly behavior I have seen so far. Will recommend to everyone. Have gone there personally for more than 100 times till now
2.0,"Overpriced n over-rated, but definitely not worth the hype. It's just a temporary setup with a AC sheet roofing but still they charge a bomb.Food is good but considering the price range, it could be a lot lot better. Highly disappointed as I expected a lot from this place."
4.0,Great food. A bit crowded. They love their butter and make sure you have ample amounts of it by hook or by crook. Lassi was not as good as expected. Cheese paranthas are really good.
4.5,"Hello ppl.. About kapoor's Cafe, real authentic Punjabi food.  #Ambience If you are looking for ambience, its not you place. From inside its look like a dhaba, normal chair and table with fan and light.  #Food Food is incredible. Real Punjabi. Parathas are yummy with lots of butter, butter almost half of the tea cup. I assure you if your diet is nor less not more then a paratha is enough for satisfaction. We have tried Malayi kofta and Panner korma, both are up to the mark. Malayi kofta is really amazing whereas korma is for those who love spicy food. Roti are normal but it gives you the feel of North Indian fulka roti. Dry fruit lassi and lassi both are good not best and little over priced.  #Service and behavior Five out of five, nice people. They will welcome you in polite way and service is very good."
4.5,"Finally I got a chance to visit this place..I have been hearing very good reviews and raves about this place and my close buddy keeps saying that parathas at his place just melts in mouth types...located off marathalli Whitefield road this is exactly an example with how simple ambience and hardly any frills a restaurant can attract crowds across. Went in at an afternoon to this place and it was packed,somehow managed to get a seat and ordered buttermilk alu parathas and baingan bharta. My goodness the parathas were really big and in came my paratha with dollops of butter...i have never seen parathas being served with so much generous serving of butter. Baingan bharta was perfectly cooked and tasted yummy. However the buttermilk with right mix of spices and masala powder was the best. After such a heavy meal buttermilk was the best way to ensure that you don't feel heavy. Finally ordered kheer which was served in a small earthern pot with dry fruits on top. A perfect way to end a sumptuous punjabi meal. Overall one of the best punjabi joints in bangalore."
4.0,"No ambiance, simple table and chair, we had aloo Paratha, gobhi Paratha, mushroom masala, plain fulka and the dry fruit Lassi, the best part is that the order is delivered to the table very fast even when the place is full"
4.5,"Been here for 3-4 times. Reasonable rates. The best place to have north indian food in Bangalore. I have tried almost all the starters, but to name a few kalmi sticka, paneer bread pakoras and punjabi style french fries are awesome. Triple cheese paratha is for cheese lovers. Nice place to hang out with your friends, with punjabi songs playing around. And dont miss the Lassi !"
4.5,This is my 250th Review and I am more than happy to write it for Kapoor's Cafe !! There is no ambiance as such ; only normal chairs n tables to sit n eat and for places like Kapoor's Cafe ambiance doesn't really matter when you get such mouthwatering food.  I visited this place with a office colleague of mine and hogged onto the food like anything. We ordered the following items:  1. Lassi; Going to a Punjabi Restraunt and not ordering Lassi is a crime in itself  !! It was blissful.  2. Paneer Do Pyaza - Good 3. Aloo Parantha; Makkan maar de diya tha4. Cheese Parantha; It was so cheesy and heavy that both of us combined could not finish it 5. Papad - to digest such a heavy dinner !  We just loved the food here !! The staff is very courteous and friendly ! It is one of the best veg Punjabi serving restaurants in Bangalore !  Ambiance N/A Food 4.5/5 Service 4/5
4.5,Pure vegetarians delight! Traditional Punjabi food made freshly to order. Rightly priced and tasty combos available which are more than filling. Don't go by the space of the place the food says it all! Satisfaction is the correct word!
4.5,One of the best places to have piping hot delicious aalo pararthas.   Their chaas is also different and absolutely delicious. Must visit for every foodie in Bangalore - absolutely mouth wateringly delicious!
3.5,"I was in Delhi for past two weeks and had the pleasure of having best of North Indian dishes in Chandi Chowk, Other old Delhi parts.  Yes it is probably the best North Indian restaurant in blore but not the place one can go again and again.  Expensive compared to quality and quantity of food.  Impressed by the staff."
4.5,"Love the food there. Been there plenty of times. The food is not expensive, tasty and healthy. Parathas and lassi is theBest alternative to pizza and coke"
4.0,"Not being a big fan of vegetarian food ..one fine evening decided to try this place (as mum asked to eat veg that day:p). The ratings were good and was serving veg Punjabi style food. We had a hard time finding this place thou as it was inside the Gurukul campus. Somehow managed to find it but by the time we reached it was almost closing time. The restaurant was crowded and that made me wonder...how good food attracts people to places.. Even when the area where the restaurant is located is messy and is all muddy during rainy days. Nevertheless, my fiancee went in and checked if we can grab something to eat...and the owner was kind enuf to offer us a table. The interiors are basic..with normal chairs n tables to sit n eat...n frankly no one seemed to bother as they were enjoying their food with friends. We placed an order for dal makhani..palak paneer...chilly onion khasta paratha...phulkas and rice kheer. The dal makhani was something!!! I haven't had such good one since years together....and although the amount was generous enuf for two...I ate off almost 80% of it:p. The palak paneer was good but could have been better. The phulkas were soft and the khasta paratha had well cooked layers with green chillies and onion stuffed in it...tasted really good. Finally we were too stuffed to try the kheer so got it packed which we later ate...it was yummy!!! Overall good food...little pricey but worth to pay for the quality... Only and only disappointment is the location...otherwise a must try!!!!"
4.0,"Brilliant place!!  Ambiance - the whole set up gives an authentic dhaba feel - even the car parking area! Food - we had Aloo Pyaaz paratha - absolutely spectacular!! The filling was great and paratha was topped with large dollop of butter - was brilliant!! Pudina khasta paratha - layered paratha - was good..... Kadai paneer, Dal Makhni - was great. The taste was absolutely spot on for taste of dhaba food...... Lassi - was served in matka - was brilliant!!  The service was great!!   Overall a brilliant place - not to be missed!!"
3.5,"We were 10mins early to this place, got that punjabi feel with their loud punjabi music waiting to clock turn 7. This venue is inside Gurukul campus, an sports indoor. Nothing to brag about ambience, food is good. We ordered Aloo pyaazz pakoras, French fries punjabi style, Veg kheema roll & Chaas. Loved their chaas, got that authentic feel. Rolls counter is outside, crowded time we will have to order rolls separately in that counter. Heard positive feedback about breakfast-have to try next time  many of their breakfast items in the menu closes by 3pm."
1.5,"I absolutely loved the food at Kapoor's Cafe. This is the closest dhaba food you can get in Bangalore. I have only one suggestion forget the ambence concentrate on the food. From the mix pakodas to the lassi to the masala papard to the the khasta paratha loved everything. If you want you have proper north indian food, this is the place to be. No matter how far Whitefield is this place is worth a visit.  Edit: I used to like this place. Used to. Its a thing of past now. They cut onions near the sitting area and when requested to stop doing that as it was making us feel uneasy they shrugged it off saying ""Let it be, bolne do"" We were shocked by the rude behavior. This was not expected from this place, this is not the hospitality expected. It just feels like a few good reviews have does not give them the right to be ride and egoistic. Very bad."
2.5,Visited here on a sunday afternoon. Its a small place next to the gurukul badmintin badminton court on varthur road.  Ordered mushroom masala and mix veg.  I must say the oil they pour in their dishes would give you cholestrol. Just by the looks! Not a lip-smacking taste. Maybe their parantha's could be worth a try!
4.0,Amazingly delicious parathas!!!! You just want to keep going back! The triple cheese parathas are to die for! Just remember to sweat out all those sinful calories!
4.5,"Best North Indian food in Bangalore, doubtless. Superb Pindi Chhole, tasty onion parantha, and excellent chhaas and lassi. Friendly people, despite being very busy. Wait for table can be longer than wait for food. But I'm not complaining. Also, loved the music - authentic and fun!"
4.0,"Visited this place couple of times with friends, although its not known for its ambience but you can expect good punjabi veg food. Parathas are very good with loads of butter This place is bit over priced."
4.0,"I would rate it 4.0 completely for the aloo parathas. The parathas are awesome which are served with a good quantity of butter. Try out the lassi, specially the Dry fruit lassi if you have sweet tooth. The pricing of the food is pretty reasonable, and Service is reasonably good. Though, during busy hours, the service gets little slow but they are very courteous and polite while dealing with customers."
3.5,"My colleague suggested Kapoor's Cafe for us Vegetarian family, and we got here recently for dinner.   Kapoor's Cafe is located near Thubarahalli busstop, few kms away from Marathahalli, on the Varthur Main Road. Kapoor's located inside Gurukul Campus, has parking space for about 15 cars.   We got here early on a weekday evening. The restaurant had just opened. The outlook of this place is bright, the lighting was quite Christmassy, (Its end of December, mind you!) you can't ignore the semi-loud music playing at this restaurant giving it a dhaba vibe.   On our way in, we bumped into Apoorv Kapoor, one of the owners of this restaurant, he was courteous and had a quick chat with us. We were then directed to the inside of the restaurant. The interiors are basic, with simple table and chairs, yet clean! If the Kapoors are aiming at Highway Dhaba look for this place, they sure have got it right.   The waitstaff took our order for -  Lassi, coffee, chai/ tea, aloo pyaz ke pakore, Paranthe - Aloo parantha, Gobhi parantha, Kastha parantha, missi roti, sarson ka saag and dal. Gobhi Parantha and sarson ka saag was not available, we ordered Corn Palak instead of sarson ka saag.   The Lassi was served in a kullad like matka, we couldn't help but feel it tasted like sweetened, packeted curd. The coffee and tea were well made. The aloo pyaz ke pakore (8 pieces), served with mint chutney were enough for us family of 4, they were absolutely crispy on the outside, mushy on the inside, one word - delicious!   The service was quick, the remaining items were served within a few minutes. The paranthas are huge, each parantha is served with almost a tablespoon of butter. They are off-course greasy and soft. The aloo paranthas were made well, just like authentic aloo paranthas, except that they were extremely spicy/ hot. There were too many mirchi/ chilly stuffed in the aloo parantha. We had to order curd seperately to combat the spiciness.  Corn Palak was well made. Missi roti was basic, yet tasty. Kastha parantha was the one we liked the most. They were soft and fluffy, and also huge!   We finished up our meal with kheer, which was served in a matka. Topped with grated nuts, Kheer was rich, aptly sweet, but the quantity seemed minimal for the price paid.  Our total bill was under 1000 rupees, which was great for a meal for 4. Just like one of the other reviewersKB mentioned, there is no bill provided to the customer, which is quite surprising for a well known restaurant like Kapoor's.   This restaurant run by Father and sons' trio is maintained well, I would like to come back and try out their other signature dishes."
4.0,"I had read a lot of good reviews about Kapoor's Cafe and I was not disappointed. This is located on the Varthur Main road, in the same vicinity as The Old gurukul sports academy. Their buttermilk and lassi is extremely soothing and delicious. The kadai paneer is one of the best in the city! With each bite I could feel the freshly ground masala which infused wonderfully into the paneer. Recalling the spicy gravy makes me want to go back again as I write this!  We ended up there again on a rainy evening and we ordered the alu fry which was so so good! I don't want to ever have fries anywhere else now! It was their one year anniversary that day and the kind owner gave us a 10% discount on our bill. A small gesture but it put a big smile on our faces... I can safely say that I'd go back there again!"
4.0,Very good punjabi food at reasonable prices. Ideal for weekend brunches if you crave for something North Indian!!! Lassi and punjabi potato fries here feature in my personal favorites..
4.0,The place is spacious and we'll maintained but hidden away from the main road. However the Punjabi flavor would make you come back again and again.   The Paneer pakoras were crispy but felt that the batter content was bit more. The Pindi choleh was little spicy but boy did it taste great! The Dal makhani was good too. The Lassi in the matki was so thick that you had to scoop it out with a spoon but one won't stop until he/she has scooped everything out.   Overall I will it give it 4 out 5 as they served the starters and main course at the same time.
4.0,"Yummiest Aloo paratha in Bangalore!! Someone recommended it. We reached on a weekend eve. Its in a tin shade with coolers and basic infra. Still our waiting was 55 and 35 min wait time. I was curious to see if its worth. After waiting period, entered the place. Looks like govt. college canteen. Maintained yes. Mr Kapoor son are good host and takes personal care of you. We ordered paratha aloo aloo pyaj mooli gobhi thali and kids aloo paratha. Yea they serve kids aloo paratha with no chilli. Paratha was served with butter and it was stuffed till edges. Crispy and  stiffing was tasty. Complement with lassi and you stop missing Murthal. Other food items were good too.  On flip side, its not a fine dining place. They don serve non veg. Now that it has gained so much popularity, they should invest in infrastructure. We are ready to pay premium for more comfortable seats. I really admire the personal attention given by Kapoor uncle and his sons to each guest. Little bit noisy because of young crowd. Over all value for money.  I cut one star for its ambience and facilities."
4.5,"Warm service with smile on the face ""typical mehman nawazi as Punjabi's do"".  Food : amazing in taste..... not expected to get such food in bangalore...  Sarson da saag yet to try...."
4.5,"If you are craving for asli Punjabi khana in the busiest IT hub of Bangalore then head to Kapoor's cafe located on varthur main road in the vicinity of the thubrahalli branch of gurukul sports academy.  The food served is absolutely delicious owing to authentic Punjabi cuisine. Crowd here keeps pouring in and I have never seen this place with empty tables. Hats off to your tastt and good quality food. A bunch of colleagues accompanied my visit to Kapoor's cafe. We ordered paneer pakoda, bread pakoda, pakoda platter, aloo pyaaz paratha, paneer paratha, corn palak curry, jeera rice, lassi n chaas.  Every dish turned out to be delicious! We fell in love with their pakodas, utterly butterly parathas ( they were loaded with nothing less than 100gm of butter) , lassi n chaas. Jeera rice was loaded with ghee (not scrumptious for folks who dislike ghee) , corn palak curry was absolutely tasty!! I believe... They have the best Punjabi cook in Bangalore. Will definitely visit this place as frequently as possible."
4.0,"This place was on my bookmarked list for a long time. Finally been to the place one day. Had heard a lot about this place. It somehow didn't meet my expectations. It is a very small place with seating capacity of around 50 people. We went on a Sunday evening and the place was crowded. Even the waiting area was full. Somehow managed to get a seat after 15 minutes of waiting. Coming the food, the food was authentic punjabi by flavour. The paranthas were good and the lassi tasted good as well. Their cheese parantha is so cheesy that we couldnt finish it completely. The rates wouldn't disappoint you at all. Must visit for a north indian in B'lore."
5.0,Fabulous food. We had ordered for a big group and had our food ready on time. It was Punjabi good served to a south Indian group and it won them over.
4.5,"Used to stay nearby this place visited many times good food,every item in menu is delicious mainly LaSsI. Manager at the place happily receives suggestions"
4.0,"Well I must say I'm not a fan of veg food..and I do not spend much on veg food...but this place just changed my notion...if you have that love for Punjabi food you must try this place out...the lassi that they serve in matkas to begin with are yummy and awesome... We had ordered aloo pyaaz ke parathe....for a calorie conscious person this can be a nightmare...reason being the lavish amount of butter that they serve the parathas with...oh man my mouth is watering..they are really good..its very famous I can say from the crowd you see there...Punjabi music in the background.. Apart from parathas we had phulke and paneer preparation by name degchiwala , if m not wrong...that was really tasty and we loved it...every one forgets about calories and cholesterol when they are at kapoors cafe...the ambience is very simple...try it and m sure you will love it too.."
1.0,Worst food. Worst Ambience. Sky-high Prices for such a bad setup and food.  The plates were not clean. We had to clean plate ourselves with tissue paper for close to half hour before we could use it for food.  Will not suggest this place even to my enemies.
4.5,"Given that its on my way to office I always wanted to go to this place. Finally got my chance to visit this restaurant. Okay, as the reviews say its the best for parathas here. The ambiences was good. A cozy lil place.   Started with aloo pyaaz pakoras. 8 pcs of super tastey ones. Very filling. Beware, don't order too much, coz you wont have space for main course.  :P jk, munch in.!   Then came paneer paratha, aloo pyaaz paratha and mix paratha. With a ball of butter and a chilling chutney. These rocked the taste buds. (so sorry, was busy eating, couldn't click it). They were really filling and worth every bite.   To finish off everything came the dried fruits lassi. Served in matki pots, they were really a cherry on the top. Wonderful experience and a must visit place for a foodie. Will recommend and visit again."
5.0,Simply the best parathas in the town. You won't ever be disappointed with their taste. Also definitely give their lassi a try. The place is crowded and is not that hi-fi. But the food is simply mouth watering and completely worth the price you pay. Do give this place a try.
4.5,Sumptuous Parathas with insane amounts of butter. Loved the Chandigarh Combo with the crunchy dry fruit lassi in matka. It's not at all over priced for the quantity they offer. Great place for Punjabi food lovers.
3.5,"Nice place for North Indians who are looking out for Home made ""Rotis"" but watch out as there is a 100% hike on having Butter Roti :-p better to ask for butter slice 'alag se' . Best thing here is Aloo Paraathe with lots of Butter and Kulhad waali Lassi. Apart from these things I feel everything is OVERPRICED here as there r combos of 450 also. We could have Buffet in that much :-p."
4.0,"If you want Asli Punjabi Khana, go to Kapoor's Cafe. This is a pretty small place with a so so ambience. But who cares about this is the food is great? Leave your diet aside and binge into the paneer lababdar and the aloo parathas with a dollop of butter on top!  Few negatives though. The aloo pyaaz pakoras were terrible. It was as if I bit into a pakora filled with oil. Also, the Lassi is not great.  That being said, I think this is a nice place to eat if you're hungry and wish to hog on a shoestring budget. Would definitely visit this place again :)"
3.5,authentic Punjabi food...finally found some place...proper dhabha with amazing lassi in kulhad. just loved it. parathas are really amazing and authentic with white home made butter. worth the money. ambience is just casual with Punjabi music. some curries are bit adhoc prepared and a bit over priced for the place. Go for parathas and rice combo and of course rajma :)
4.5,"Recommended by a collgue at office, had been there with my team n enjoyed great food  , being south Indian, looking for spicy food, this place gives you food with almost satisfy your taste buds, we tried all types of available parathas n they are great , must try are lussi n french fries Punjabi style."
5.0,Everything is awesome.. French fries punjabi style is a must try. Paratas are yummy esp with white butter.. Lassi is too good too..Loved it..
4.0,A place to satisfy your punjabi taste buds. It had been in bookmarks for so long and finally visited.  So much of dhaba feel in Whitefield. Went for a Saturday dinner probably for an early dinner timings. The place was full and we had to wait for almost 30 mins. I can definitely say it was worth it. What an amazing place the feel the crowd and yes the food. The food was amazing but the lassi. Lassi was just curd with sugar. You DO NOT make lassi like this Bangalore. But everything else were all nicely prepared with proper tastes.  Would definitely visit for more dal makhani n more.  Parking-  Yes  Ambience - 3.5/5 Cleanliness 3.5/5 Taste 5/5 Service 4.5/5 Value for money 4.5/5 Would visit again?  Definitely yes.
4.0,"Kapoor's Cafe offers you all that a food lover needs: good food and excellent service! Its authentic Punjabi food, the simple ambience, and the 80s & 90s Bollywood tracks playing in the background gives you a complete dhaba experience. It's a complete vegetarian restaurant, but don't be disheartened. The food tastes so good that it's popular among many hardcore non vegetarians too. We ordered the Alu Pyaaz pakoras, which had the right amount of crispiness. Their parathas are to die for. And each paratha is served with a generous dollop of butter, which leaves you satiated by the end of it. The Kadai Paneer and Aloo Gobi were the perfect combination for the light and airy fulkas. Don't forget to order their masala chaas or their rich, thick, and creamy lassis."
4.0,"Finally a proper punjabi cuisine restaurant in bangalore.. it is soo authentic that it reminds you of the highway dhabas... the interior is complete dhaba style, great service.. coming to food its pure punjabi cuisine and it is very very rich .. paranthas are smothered with ghee or butter and they taste amazing also tried dal makhani which was average and paneer lababdar too was ok... we had ordered a combo which had lassi but we tld them to make it dry fruit lassi and they did that without any hesitation , this is the standard of service they maintain to make customers come back again..... i found the price little on the upper side as fr a thali it was Rs400+ but maybe that is because they use rich ingredients in their food... and ya they do no compromise is maska in food and dry fruits in desert..... fruit cream is heaven on earth ... rice kheer, shahi tukda, dry fruit lassi are also amazing..."
4.0,"My one-stop destination for desi north Indian ghar ka khana. If you're not calorie conscious, go right ahead and try their famous kulhad mein thick lassi that is worth a heavy cardio workout in the gym, or their famous cheese paratha that is smothered with a double-dollop of amul butter. Yumm! On any normal day when I care about my weight, I go for their regular menu options which has your chhole kulche or paratha with the usual dal and sabzi, all worth a mention. A humble place with a menu that doesn't burn a hole in your pocket, this is a veggie lover's paradise!"
4.5,The best and most fresh paneer i have tasted in forever! These guys make the most amazing paneer pakodas! Paneer is so soft i could cry! Lol.. Oh and you have to try their buttermilk and lassi.. Both too good! The ambience pretty much sets the expectations of what to look for! Very desi.. Very nice! :)
4.0,"They serve authentic north indian food. Dont go on ambience but the quality of food is really appreciable. We ordered paranthas, paneer makhanai and missi rotis and all were good. One thing missing was tandoori stuff like rotis and naans                                                                 akhilkohlifoodjourney.wordpress.com"
4.0,"Once u take the unassuming left gali to reach the place, you'll realise this place is not just another Punjabi restaurant. It's a food festival  specially on weekend evenings. You need to wait 40-50 mins to get a table. So make sure you have a company( hope that's not your smartphone ) :) service obviously take a back seat given the crowd but past all that, food is yummy and mouth watering. Aloo paratha is real treat and dry fruit lassi is worth every dime !! Chaas, dal makhani, sarso saag, paneer lababdar, paneer kadai - all must try to satisfy the natural love for Punjabi food every Indian has ;)"
4.0,"They are known for Punjabi cuisine and I have been here couple of times, so I assure u that they are consistent enough. I really like gobhi ka paratha when i had been first time over here. This place is always crowded obviously for its fame. Even liked the deserts. I make sure to drink a matka of lassi when I am anywhere near to this place."
4.0,"Punjabi tadka oye! Flavourful, buttery and reminding me so much of authentic Punjabi food, kapoor's comes across as one of the best north Indian joints that i have been to in Bangalore.  It's invariably filled everyday of the week during peak lunch and dinner hours. This was my third visit, and my first on a weekday. The decor and seating is nothing to boast about,and is designed in a way to maximise the number of people. The food in turn, speaks volumes. We had ordered a Punjabi style french fries, a Paneer paratha, a mix paratha, a mattar khulcha platter, chaas and a lassi for 2 people :D. The Punjabi fries, a different take of the normal fries, was just about alright. The highlight was the two parathas with ooodles of butter on them! Very appetizing and really tasty. The mattar khulcha platter, was exchanged with missi roti platter as there wasn't any khulcha available. :/. Missi roti's were a drag and I don't really recommend eating them if you don't have a taste for it.  The lassi was perfect with the right amount of sweet in it. Complemented the spicy Punjabi fries completely! Things to try : Try the parathas. By far the best in town. Try the cholle bhatoore as well as the items in the breakfast menu, really tasty! (Past visits) USP : the only good north Indian joint in and around Whitefield with a value for money package."
4.0,"The first thing that struck me about this place was its ambiance. Cafe really suits it. Everything is awesome. In one word,  Value for money."
4.0,"An ideal place if u are planning to go in for a North Indian feast that'll make you feel close to homemade food. The ambience is a mixture of a dhaba and a normal restaurant. Every dish on the menu is cooked in a proper North Indian way with not a single ting of the South. The rotis and parathas are definitely made using wheat unlike places where you might find a mixture of maida in it. If planning for a dinner kindly try to get in a bit early or else, thanks to the hot n fresh yummy food, you'll have to wait in a long queue. According to the food that is served the amount you would pay for it, I'm sure it'll will leave you satisfied."
3.0,"The quality of food was OK ,not up to the mark what Punjabi Food meant for. Basic things were missing like Lemon. In menu Naan and Tandoori were not there."
4.5,"Really good food and service. Enjoyed dining :) Must have Lassi ,Butter milk and Kheer. Ambience is average. Pocket friendly :) The place will ensure is a content meal anytime in the day..!!"
4.0,"Its the best authentic punjabi food joint in Whitefield. Their lipsmacking pranthas and lassi always made me crave to have a meal atleast once a week. Especially Baingan Bharta, Paneer prantha and Sweet Lassi. Suggestion-They should improve on the ambiance and seating. According to me their prices are bit high if we consider their seating."
4.0,"Went to Kapoor's for dinner in Sunday evening. The menu is all punjabi, food quality and quantity are good. We had the Paneer Pakora, Paneer Bhurji and Malai kofta. Only issue was that the pakora was quite tasteless, rest of the food was good. Three dishes, six roti and a masala soft drink cost is about 700 which is absolutely fine. The surrounding might be a let down but then again I don't go to restaurants to stare at walls."
4.5,The food is really good here. Though vegetarian but love this place. The lassi is the best and a must try . The ambience is also pretty good.  The owners very courteous . This place is packed most of the time so  you might have to wait for a table. But definitely worth it.
4.5,"A small gem near Whitefield road, this place is a small punjani dhaba in South. They serve yummy parathas, pakoras, rajma-rice, chole-bhature, spicy kadhai paneer and lassi to name a few. I have passed near the Thubarahalli bus stop umpteen times but somehow never noticed this small food joint. Based on my friend's recommendation I decided to try it, and I literally had to use Google maps to reach this place. A small dhaba kind of outlet inside the Gurukul campus. There is sufficient parking space available there and it is hell crowded on weekends. more details on the blog link                                                                 ...Read full post on travelhues.blogspot.com"
2.5,Disappointed!! After seeing such a good rating on zomato I decided to visit this place and got disappointed. I ordered kadhai paneer and phulke.. Quantity was increased by adding too much gravy. Taste wise it was just ok ok type. Phulke was cold. I felt either my order is wrong or it's just overly hyped place.
3.5,"I have been visiting this place since they started. During the initial  days when it was not that crowded food taste was awesome.Especially their mix paratha and cheese parata. Try basic stuff. Their fancy names does not  live up to the mark.(Some four layer parata etc)  Off late due to increase in customer base, taste has really come down. I have observed this in last 3 visits. epecially last visit was not that good with taste.  But one thing was common among all these days, energy in the two youngstars who run the show was consistent even with increase in crowd.  Expect a waiting time of 10-20 min if you are visiting after 8.45pm or so. Ambience: 2/5 food:3.5/5."
4.0,"Very nice North Indian food. Lassi was so thick and tasty. We had French fries Punjabi style, malai kofta, shahi paneer, pindi chole. You must try pindi chole, it was spicy and tasty with different style . Menu has many items, you have variety to choose. You need to book table , if you are going with group it's always crowded I think. Ambiance was ok, dhaba style. But food is awesome, service is also good. You don't have to wait for long time for your food. Overall experience is good, must try.  Food - 5/5 Ambiance - 3/5 Service - 4/5"
4.0,"Typical spicy punjabbi Khana is what you get here at the lowest costs.The interior is average but the food u get here in unbeatable. The service is quick and nice. Two brothers are the owners and they are too kind :)I personally love the signature cheese triple layer paratha. Just one paratha is enough to fulfill the hunger no matter how hungry you are. The best parathas that can ever be made. The parathas are served with butter and tangy green chutney too. Also, do try the signature dry fruit lassi which is served in Kulhads and the Kadai paneer. Foodgasm guaranteed! :)                                                                 foodgasmdiaries.wordpress.com"
4.0,"This place did provide some awesome authentic punjabi food. A must go for people who love the Desi North Indian taste and anything you order here, would definitely worth the try and more..!! One thing that the place will ensure is a content meal anytime in the day..!!  Kudos"
1.0,"Not sure, why there is so much buzz about this place.  Giving 2 rating just because of the Lassi. Else parathas are just over spicy, and aloo gobhi ki sabzi not good at all.  Just giving butter all over your food does not make your food taste good.  Also service is not that good and its overpriced too.   Sad sad experience."
4.0,Very nice food. Lot of butter and so tasty. Lassi and coffee were also good. Priced okay. But definitely can be tried. Had cheese paratha aloo paratha and paneer paratha. All were good.
4.5,Great parathas. Simple seating and enjoyable dhaba food. Will come back any day. Not very cheap but worth the money. Try buttermilk and rajma chawal.
4.0,My anytime- ready-to-go place for the amazing Punjabi food. The rich food is just so yummy and must be one of the best among what you can expect from Punjabi cuisine in the city.
4.0,"Its a unplanned visit to this cafe.. Got surprised by the long queue outside the entrance.. Seriously wait to this place is worth.. Started the lunch with paneer n mushroom starters, munched main course like kolhapuri n paneer butter masala with phulkas n cheese parathas, ended with dryfruit lassi n butter milk.. Really none of the dishes disappointed.. Thanks guys for ur tasty mouth watering khana.."
5.0,Amazing authentic punjabi food in whitefield bangalore... punjabi music dhaba style kapoor's cafe is one n only destination if u r craving for punjabi food in bangalore (usually i dn't find good punjabi food here)
4.0,"I got such good reviews about this place from so many people that i just had to visit this place and I was not disappointed. Its a very simple and a small place. Not much on the ambience side. Its more like those dhabas that you have in punjab. Simple chairs and tables. Coming to the food we ordered dal makhani which was very good and paneer degchi which was decent but not great. We also ordered missi roti, missi parathas, khasta wheat parantha which were also pretty good. To drink we ordered lassi which was good , chaas and masala coke were decent. I felt the prices were a little on the higher side when compared to the overall feel ( ambience , food , location ). We were a group of 4 people and we paid around 300 each for the food I have mentioned above. Overall i would recommend this place for people who are simply looking to eat good north indian punjabi food and are not really bothered about the overall ambience. One thing I forgot to mention they play good punjabi music. I being a punjabi loved it :)."
4.0,"I don't generally go for an all-veg restaurant when it comes to North-Indian food because c'mon, who eats North-Indian without atleast chicken. But this is the exception in my self-proclaimed rule. They make up for the absence of chicken from the menu by adding butter to EVERYthing! And you will love it no matter how much you regret that little extra weight after that.  Their menu covers all the category from roti-naan-kulche, to all types of curries and daals, to the famous lassi that you have to have after the meal.  The cute uncle that sits at the cashier's, is always enthusiastic for any kind of suggestions you might have for the place. The popularity of the place can be seen by the fact that within a year's time, they have changed from half their size to now a full fledged advance table booking system incorporated restaurant. Next time I am going to suggest that uncle some apps for the same."
1.0,"We were planning to have a heartful north Indian dinner and went to Kapoor's Cafe to see what the hype is all about. Waited for some 30 minutes as it was a crowded weekend. Now I wonder we should have left then and there without waiting. We ordered pundina paratha, dal makhni, lassi and some cheese paratha. While the pundina paratha was totally bland , dal makhni tasted as if it was burnt. And I was highly suspicious if it was dal makhni at all. My friend complained the attendant about the bland parathas but he said that these are like that only. The worst part was when my friend opened the upper crust of his cheese paratha and found plastic cover inside! Now that was when I lost all of my appetite. The attendant apologised profusely and changed the paratha but we had already made up our minds to never head in this direction. The ambiance also failed to make the whole affair a little bit more appetising.  I wish I could had a single dish that could've made me rate it a bit higher than 1. Highly disappointing!"
4.5,"Writing this review after a dinner at Kapoor's last night.   Ambience - It looks like they are aiming for the highway side Dhaba look. If they are, they got it spot on. Don't go looking for a romantic candle light dinner. I am saying this first because sometimes we are just itching for GREAT food and don't really care about where we eat it. Kapoor's is a cute little place. Extremely clean with tables and chairs arranged in rows. That's all.   Customer service - The brothers that run this place, as well as the wait staff are so courteous. You have to pay the check at the door when you leave. I was amazed that one of the brothers who was at the counter KNEW exactly what my leftovers that I had asked to wrap for me. We were AMAZED and he humbly says ""part of the job"". That's to show they pay attention to heir customers. Fantastic!  Food - Oh God, the food!!!! It's completely vegetarian, which is a God send for us vegetarians, because we are not wondering what spoons were cross contaminated. So far, Lassi in a Matka, Paneer Butter Masala, Chole Bhature, and different varieties of stuffed Parathas is what I have had. I keep going back for more of the same :-) The Lassi is just so thick and correctly sweetened, it's amazing. Sometimes you run the risk of over eating the Lassi and not being able to eat anything more!!! Parathas are just too good, although, the first time I went with my mom, we ordered a Paneer paratha along with an Aloo Paratha, and the Paneer paratha was less than room temperature. Very tasty nonetheless, but didn't expect that from Kapoor's. I pointed it out to one of the waiters, and he just awkwardly smiled and left. Maybe he didn't understand me? We ordered the paneer butter masala combo, which comes with rice, onion slices, PBM ofcourse, Aloo Jeera and 2 Phulkas. Quite a heavy meal for us. We always share as it is just too big of a plate. Very very tasty food. Also one of the best Chole Bhature I have had in a long time.   Sorry for the lengthy review, but this is our latest haunt and we love it!!! Giving it a 4.5 because I don't know to give it a 4.8 on my phone ;-) Taking out 0.2 for the cold paratha, but all is forgiven. Will keep going back for more!!!!"
4.5,"Pure veg - ""Punjabi""  that's the first thing you might notice. It's an absolute bliss to find a big ""only"" veg menu. Lassi and paratha - must haves. Expect 20-25 mins waiting on weekends. You can try the chai and rolls while waiting. Chai is really nice."
3.5,Place had good parathas and lassi was one of the best I've ever tasted.And the best part is its not too expensive either..Good food at normal rates
3.0,"Nothing exceptional...ordered through swiggy. The triple cheese paratha was little undercooked. Special paneer degchi was with too much oil. For the price, the amount is not at all normal."
3.5,"The place tell you bodly that you don't need great ambience to be famous - stick to basics and provide great food . Its located on the edge of road and i have managed to skip the exact location couple of times .  Coming to the food - the food is extremely good but lately its taste is dropping - the lassi is good but not the authentic , should be thicker . The chole bathurae is great . Parontha is okay , dal makhani is good too .  The place is occupied and the waiting list is getting longer on weekends . Overall a good go for the desi breakfast eaters"
4.0,"Located on varthur road, kapoor' cafe is simple dhaba style restaurant. Pure veg restaurant and menu is extensive. Chaas and masala cold drinks was a good start. Aloo pakoras were tasty and huge in size, 8 pieces will fill ur stomach. Paneer dopyaza was tasty. Phulkas were soft and tasty. Dhabe ki dal was good. Service is very fast. Light on pocket. Will visit again."
4.5,Awesome food nominal price good dhabha feel inside city paranthas were delicious with lots of butter and the khass is a must try go for good home feel
4.5,"Nice Punjabi veg food....loved the Lassi in kulhad!...very difficult to find such a lassi in Bangalore. It was packed and the service was very polite and quick...the music adds to the experience...prices in the menu are inclusive of taxes, wish other restaurants could follow this!...one tip for first timers..you might end up ordering more than you can eat, so go slow! Cheers!"
4.5,"If you are looking for good North Indian food, this is the place for you. Ambience is not so great. You should come here only for eating. Not a place to spend time. If you want to come on weekends, be ready to wait, as there would be heavy rush. Items are slightly pricey. Around 500 for two people."
2.0,"No tandoor, so cannot say it serves north indian food. Even the incomplete north indian food is just ok. Lots of butter and fats does not make food tastes good. Food lacks flavor and needs fine tuning. Although the place is economical and their lassi is awesome. Good zomato rating tricked me, dont let it trick you."
5.0,"In layman language,its a typical Delhi- Haridwar highway situated Dhaba amidst the hustle bustle of Bangalore.To tell it all,this place is always full with no seat vacant during peak lunch and dinner hours. Once visited guest comes back and also recommends others to come to this place irrespective of its less spacious and cosy seating area.  These guys are the undisputed kings in Paratha Making.They believe in sending you back adding a good amount of harmless calorie in your body.Hehe.  Aloo ka Paratha,Aloo Pyaaz ka Paratha,cheese Paratha,Mix Veg Paratha,Paneer ki Dhekchi.It wont be wrong if I say they  top it with a big chunk of butter on top to show all their love for their guests which makes the dish even more delectable.  You just can't have one serving of their Dry Fruit Lassi and Shahi Tukda.Its tasty to death.  Warm service.Extremely cheap prices.Amazing amazing food.Must visit:)"
4.5,I am little late to give the review but havn't forgot the good food.Been there few weeks ago on a weekend it was fully packed with a waiting list of 84 for us....but who will go home without enjoying delicious and yummy food..... Pyaaz pakora's are my husband's favorite.... One of the best place to enjoy north Indian food. Keep it up.... Food-4.8/5 Service-4/5 Ambience-4/5
4.5,"This is easily one of the best restaurants I have been to, in a long while. The food was sumptuous and of excellent quality. We went out for a team lunch and ordered a variety of parathas (aloo pyaaz, aloo and gobi), veg kadhai, boondi raita, kulchas and phulkas, dry fruit lassi, and their thali combos. Each of the items seemed to have been cooked with utmost care, especially the awesome parathas (with dollops of butter to boot). We also ordered shahi tukda, chawal kheer and fruit cream for dessert. All in all, an excellent value-for-money experience"
3.5,"Ok- So I am a hard core non veggie and I hate to usually go out and eat vegetarian.So I almost never eat vegetarian at any restaurant.My friends tricked me to go to this place and I am happy they did.  Yummy vegetarian food in this place.I had one of the best lassi here (dry fruit lassi).I could just have that alone and fill my stomach. Had tried some starters,jeera rice-they were good. I tried missi roti(also had parata from my friends plate) and paneer curries and dal makhni-they were absolute delight! We were like stomach full and satisfied and I decided that if I had to do veggie again-this would be the place. Ambience is just like a small cafe-nothing great.But who cares when the food is good and is pocket friendly as well!  Definitely recommended for all veggies and non veggies who wana try some yummy veg food!"
4.0,"Ambience - 1 Food - 4 Service - 3 Paneer Lababdar - 5 - the best paneer lababdar I've had till now. Made my day. Cut down on the quantity of raita served, and the price of course."
4.5,"Great food, especially the paranthe which is served with a lot of butter accentuating the already fingerlicking taste of the home like food. The ambience as such is set like a dhaba, so not a place if you love only dimly lit royal ambience. Must give it a try if you haven't already."
3.5,"I have visited this place many times just after office hour in evening as its nearby my home.  Food is good but hygeine wud be a concern for those who keep a very high check on ghee/oil.   I would give no points for ambience.   3.5 stars because of tasty food and pocket friendly place.   Parathas are pure Punjabi style taste and a must try dry fruit lassi.  Starters are OK. Paneer pakora was very good but heavy.   I would like to visit this place again expecting improvements in ambience, quality of food and more variety."
5.0,I decided to try this restaurant after being recommended by a lot of my friends. Ordered Dal makhni and Panner butter masala along with ghee phulka. Simple finger licking delicious food!!!! The best north Indian good I've eaten in Bangalore. Their dry fruit lassi is epic! They are rated as the best restaurant for flavor of India by zomato also. I would recommend this to anyone who is from North and wants to eat the authentic Dal makhni!
5.0,"Wow...just been here today for lunch with my team ahh the food is just awesome , it's like a genie sitting the kitchen room and waving his magic on the food we ordered. Never ever tasted panner so good  Kulcha was like a cotton melting in mouth yummmm.  Please maintain the same"
3.5,A perfect dhaba with yummy and sinful delicacy.. Parathas r awesome with a huge portion butter on top of it. Don't miss the lassi here.. They can still work on cleanliness and hygiene.
4.0,"Went there on a busy Sunday Night.. The person at the entrance was very courteous, he guided us to the parking spot and also handed our waiting queue token. He also checked back us on couple of times with our number to ensure he didn't miss us. After a 15 minute wait we got our table. Ordered Masala Chaas, Dry Fruit Lassi, the french fries punjabi style, The Paneer Degchi Delhi Wale, Corn Masala and some Phulkas. The food was excellent, especially the Paneer Degchi.. we just loved it. The French Fries were good and Chaas and Lassi served in a Khullard were amazing. We just felt that the Corn Masala was a bit Tangy, since it was made in a Tomato base.... maybe adding a bit more spices/salt could have balanced that out. Apart from that had everything else was just perfect. Will definitely visit again."
3.0,"Simple ambiance , a dhaba feel and bustling with life is what you will witness here. Must try would be the paneer pakoda, parathas and lassi. Overall the food is clean and decent. Their parathas are spicy so watch out. Service is friendly and quick and price is reasonable."
5.0,"Been there more than thrice..Paneer is so soft, starters with great taste. Love the butter on Parathas. one best place for all foodies out here. Don't ask for kulcha you will end up receiving roasted bread... Do not miss fruit icecream at the end which is mind blowing. 5/5 because , you will be satisfied once you are out from the place."
4.0,"Went to this place on a friend's suggestion and yes the lunch was fulfilling and wonderful !! Ordered cheese paratha & aloo pyaaz paratha, both were tasty and had good amount of stuffing, Loads of butter on the top was bonus :) Butter milk was okay, lassi was proper sweet and thick.. Aparr from parathas, loved the punjabi daal combo meal, everything in the plate was delicious and more of ghar ka khana :-) Good punjabi songs playing in the background, The visit was value for money!!"
5.0,"One of the best for authentic Punjabi food in Whitefield area. The food is awesome dal, sabji and rotis anything you order is best.. specially missi roti, dhaba dal & lassi . Overall this place is value for money, quantity is also fine. Service is also so quick there. I did not find this kind of food anywhere in B'lore. Must have dinner once.."
4.5,Been there today for dinner... Twas quite good... Actually one of the best in the city and reasonably priced too... N icing on the cake is that the owners come and ask you personally how was our experience... It just shows how much they care for their restaurant and the food they serve to their customers... Overall a good one...
4.5,This restaurant is very good specially the food. I love their parathas with lots of makkhan... and their lassi is best in Bangalore till now
4.0,Had been there last month.Ambience and  is not that Great but food served is authentic Punjabi and let's you forget the Ambience .quick service Had good Punjabi food and would recommend this place to have  nice Punjabi food after bobby the dhaba
4.0,"This place being next to my PG, is one place I go to when am lazy to drive in the traffic and wanna have veg food.. Amazing place with a lively crowd and ambience.. The aloo parata is something u must have here.. Also the baingan bhartha is a must have.. Don't forget to end it with their amazing lassi or a hot cup of tea !!"
5.0,"This place is the best! From their songs to their menu, everything is Punjabi!  Waiting time for this restaurant is 15-20nins easily on weekends but it is worth. When you look at the price, you might feel its little expensive but, such is the quantity and quality. We had French Fries Punjabi Style, Lassi, Cheese Paratha, Kulcha and Paneer Lababdar. And everything was Finger-licking-gooood with sooo much makkhan on it!  Think before you order, quantity is pretty pretty good. And that Cheese Paratha I'll tell you, is out of the world!"
4.5,"One stop for authentic Punjabi cuisine in Whitefield area. Despite the long waiting queues outside the restaurant, the waiting time is not that much as the staff handles the table allocation very deftly. The food is good, value for money, though it's veg. Love their lassi and cheese paratha... The thalis are very good and amount served is more than enough for one person. Have been there multiple times already , and would surely visit again and again."
4.5,"One of best Authentic Punjabi Restaurant in Bangalore. Aluparatha, Lassi, Daal all the the items in the menu are good. If you plan to go in weekends then better do prior booking. And best part is the Punjabi Style Hospitality courtesy to their owners. Great job keep it up."
2.5,"Had lunch there yesterday, was packed with people, took about 20 minutes to get the table. Very very average place to look at. Wires dangling all around making it also look unsafe. Service is surely an area they can improve upon. It took us 45 minutes to get to the food.  We ordered paranthas, Bhatura, Phulkas, Paneer dish and lassi. Paranthas were Tawa paranthas and pretty good. Everybody liked them. Lassi was nice and thick but little too sweet. Overall average experience and may not go again with family. As a bachelor for paranthas maybe yes."
5.0,"Awesome Food. Excellent Service. Value for Money. Just visit once, you'd love the food. Try their Dry Fruit lassi, which makes you feel Glutton."
4.0,This place is near to my house.. So I usually visit here to have some nice paratha.. They serve super hot paratha with loads of butter... People on diet--- don't even try please.. :D  Make sure you reach early on weekends to get a seat otherwise you will end up waiting in the loooooong queue...  Service is OK except peak hours.. You need to wait a little bit for the food ordered.
4.5,"A great place to have heartful of amazing food.  Best paranthas topped with lots of butter. One of the best dal makhni I have had in bangalore.  Really good service, go here if you want to have great food and don't care too much about the ambience, it's a simple place with good and reasonably priced food."
4.0,I went for dinner with my team. They serve decent north Indian food. I liked lassi which is hard to find in Bangalore. Service is also prompt. Overall this place is value for money
4.5,Had been there for my punjabi friend's birthday treat. It was an awesome experiance. I would say this is the best place to have parathas in bangalore. Loved the cheese parathas. The service is good and pretty fast.  Tip: Don't forget to have the Dry Fruit Lassi :)
3.5,"Updated one -- ---------------------- Visited the place lately and had few disappointments 1) Paneer do pyaza - The paneer was hard and rubbery and was not eatable at all. 2) Lassi - I do not understand in which Punjabi restaurant the lassi is served in clay pot. If you are saying you are authentic Punjabi eatery then serve the lassi in Brass glass or at least in a glass.  Reducing the rating from 4 to 3.5 cuz of this exp  ------------------------------------------------------                  Reached there quite late on Friday night as it was about to strike 11pm. Thought they are not entertaining any more customers as saw the closed danglers on the door. I went inside and the owner was kind enough to give us a table and they were taking the last order. So went for Chilli Onion Khasta Paratha, Palak Paneer, Dal Makkhani, Phulka and rice kheer. The order took little time to be served as they were full. The food was good 1) Chilli Onion Khasta Paratha - i expected it to be paratha having red chilli powder which is usually served at lot many places whereas they had green chilli. But the paratha was good and tasty. 2) Palak Paneer - It had lots of small paneer chunks and soft, you could feel the taste of palak. But as per me the Palak Paneer could have been little better. 3) Dal Makkhani - This item was the show stopper, awesome dal and really yummy. A must try. 4) Phulka - It was soft and big. 2 is kind of enough for a person until you are really hungry. 5) Kheer - They served the kheer in handi kind pot. We were so full that we had to get kheer as take away but kheer was good. Ambience is very simple and the main attraction is food, and yeah 2 sides are enough for 3. Will visit this place again."
4.5,Most attractive thing is the chapati here. It is like home made and that makes difference. Small cosy place to have good quality breakfast or lunch or dinner. The French fries ( with a stir fried green chilli) is very nice and the matka lassi is a perfect accompaniment to your meal.
4.0,"We went to Kapoor's cafe for an early lunch after reading all the gud reviews on zomato. There wasnt much crowd as we were early. We played safe and ordered paneer butter masala, matar pulao and a few missi roti.  The Paneer Butter masala was good 4/5  Th missi roti was a delight to eat. Spicy and authentic in taste. 5/5  Matar pulao was the real surprise. The peas didnt smell or taste frozen. (Thank God for that...phew) 5/5  Would definitely visit again to try the other stuff on their menu"
4.5,Small place but food is yummy....with lots of butter...typical Punjabi food...i loved it....M gona visit this place again...and try some more dishes
4.5,"We went there on a sunday afternoon.It was crowded.Its a simple place only one room filled with chairs and tables.finally after some time we got a place in a corner.We ordered lassi,gobhi masala dry,mushroom gravy and fulkas.The food was yumm.Specially the Mushroom dish.Lassi was too good.Service was a bit slow but that we could have also felt because we were very hungry and wanted everything at once...:-P :-P"
4.0,"Simple Ambiance, good food and a dhaba feel. If you are looking for these things then Kapoor Cafe is the place for you.  I tried the following : -- Paneer paratha: Decent -- Aloo Paratha : Full of butter and flavor -- Lassi : Thick and sweet, just the way I like it. -- Dal makhani. : Amazing flavor and light on the tummy.  I will surely visit this place to try more dishes. Price wise this place is very affordable and even though the price is low, there is no compromise on the quantity or quality.  Service : 4/5 Food: 4.5/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Price : 4/5                                                                 foodzillaweb.wordpress.com"
3.5,"Went to this place with much anticipation and with some difficulty as well. It's right opposite to Thubarahalli bus stop in a small lane. Due to the notorious Kundalahalli signal, you may find it little taxing to reach there. The outside and inside of the hotel is nothing that I have pictured myself. The music is too loud and speakers were bang on top of us. So, we moved to other place and the intensity was bearable. Ordered Assorted pakoras, mix paratha,missi roti,kulcha, Paneer lababdar, chaas and lassi. We couldn't complete all the items. Mix paratha was huge with generous amount of butter to go with it. I have never seen so much butter on a single paratha. Pakoras were hot and tasted good. Paneer lababdar was not bad. The food was fresh and piping hot. Chaas and lassi were awesome. Stuffed parathas stand out!! The waiters were courteous and the owner checked on us about the taste of the food. They have a huge place for parking. As some people rightly pointed out, its little over hyped."
3.5,"Was searching for some Punjabi restaurants in and around Whitefield on Zomato. Thus, discovered kapoor's cafe. The encouraging reviews made this place number 1 on my wish list. Finally, got an opportunity to go out for dinner on a Sunday night. Located just besides gurukul sports academy in thubarahalli. You will have no difficulty whatsoever in finding the place. A special word for the ambience of the place. I have observed that many restros in order to give you a dhaba feel will put up khaats, uncomfortable seatings, you will find a truck model in some corner but kapoor's cafe keeps it really simple with proper seating, coolers, fantastic Punjabi music. Thankyou kapoor uncle for not overdoing it. :) For starters we had ordered assorted pakoras and Punjabi sticks. Both were below the expectations. The khasta parantha was really crispy and tasted nice. Paneer sabzis failed to impress. But the show stealer was baigan ka bharta. It reminded of home! Truly awesome(thankyou kapoor aunty :) ) Didn't get to try the famous parathas and lassi. Will surely the next time. The service was really good. Fast and error free. Quite phenomenal considering the number of people they were handling. The dishes are fairly priced and the portions served were quite filling. Overall a nice experience. Will surely visit the place again to try out the parathas and lassi! Cheers!!!"
3.0,"For North Indians this can actually be the place where you can get a feel of a dhaba type Punjabi. Even the ambience gives a feel of it. The taste overall was pretty good. Bhenghan ka bharta was yum. Truly delighted till the last lick of the finger. As my friends will put it. But the rest of the veggies, specially paneer ones tasted sweet rather than bit spicy. Parathas were also good and can be tried upon. But we had a bad experience with the starters. Tasted dull. Yea we missed upon the lassi thing as we overate the food. Not because it tasted good.. Naaahh.. But the quantity was pretty good."
4.5,"Food is good. but, it is bit crowdy on week-end and it might take even upto an hour for turn to come. There is no waiting area. However, service is fast once ordered"
3.5,This place is very overhyped i feel. I went there after reading a lot of reviews but i left out unsatisfied. I don't know whether is only our group or some other people also feel the same way. I lived in punjab for 4 years and i can tell you this was nothing compared to what i had in 4 years.   We ordered: Buttermilk: First batch was awesome but i don't know why the second one was not that good.  Paneer pakoda: Very very average Triple cheese paratha: none of us in our group liked Kadi: average Rajma masala: very good Paneer: good  Deserts are good.  This place deserve 3.5 at max according to me.
5.0,Commendable authentic food for northies although for Punjabi's it will be the best I am damn sure :)Cheez parantha along with lassi is a must eat item here which in its own holds the goodness for every possible reason.
4.5,"Got to know about Kapoor's cafe yesterday evening from a friendly neighbour who tried some authentic punju khanna a few days ago with his family.... upon their reviews decided to have Sunday lunch @Kapoor's...The place looks like a pucca dhaba ishtyle...it was jam packed when I went in at 1 pm...Anyways I had to take parcel so no worries...Coming to the food...Ordered Paneer butter masala...Taste 5/5 Mushroom masala - Taste 5/5 Shahi pulav - 4/5...(rice a little tough, less salt) Dry fruits lassi - 5/5 ....Overall food was tasty n yummy.. Just loved it !! If I say in Mumbai ka language...its JHAKAS !!  waiting to taste the other dishes...."
4.0,"We went here after many recommendations and reading rave reviews of this place.  It was a bit difficult to locate this inconspicuous place tucked into a sports academy premise. But you ask around for it and everyone knows where it is. So that way, easy-peasy.  We went in a few minutes early into the rush hour and got a table immediately. The Sr.Mr. Kapoor sits at the desk and greeted us with his really friendly smile. The captains, the Jr. Kapoors, I assume took just anyone's orders and explained well what the dishes were. Apparently all the dishes are the recipes of the mother. They were extremely courteous and polite not just to the customers but to the staff as well. (Having had a recent tiff-off with the owner/manager of another restaurant, this was such a welcome.) The place is really really simple in decor. Food is cooked here with a lot of love. It's very evident.  We ordered: Chaas: 5/5 awesome-st.  Kalmi sticks: first steamed and then fried multi-grain goodies which were surprisingly not very oily. 4/5 Chilly khasta parantha: 3.5/5. I personally don't favour ajwain.  Kadai paneer: 4.5/5 extremely tasty.  Fruit cream: 10/5 super duper awesome dessert. Heavy on the tummy.   While we sat waiting for our food, a look into the food in the neighbouring tables were so much so appealing, making us want to drive again 40kms for a visit next time.  Must must have: the amazing fruit cream.   Billing: you pay the Sr. Kapoor at the entrance table. It's a very primitive practice, but quaintly warming to be around him who probably rubs off his warmth into the staff."
4.0,"Pure Punjabi dhaba types, which is rare to find in Bangalore. Parathas are really good. I had 3 lassy there. Been there three times. Loved it :D"
4.5,"WENT HERE after seeing a whooping rating and awesome reviews. Well if I keep aside ambience, the place deserves 5/5. THe service is good. Paranthas's are awesome. The owner is so soft spoken and asking for feedback that is something I liked personally. There kulhad chaas and lassi is worth a try. Best PArt : i got white makhan here..."
4.0,"This place is a food heaven for every North Indian who's missing good punjabi food in South India. We ordered Chhola Bhatura, Gobhi Parantha & lassi. The chhola bhatura was quite disappointing, especially chhola. The gobhi parantha was huge, stuffed well, loaded with butter & just out of this world. The lassi was quite nice but a little too sweet & heavy. All in all would recommend everyone to stick to paranthas here, their speciality."
4.0,"First impressions !!! Donno why they have called it a cafe !!! Looks like a perfect dhaba setting !!! Beehive parking of cars and bikes instead of the usual trucks, an off beat stereo trying to play the Punjabi hits , an old kinda of cooler keeping the temperatures in check a decent and relatively clean toilet yet has the shady look!!! Some good food !!!   We had heard a lot of rave reviews of this place! We never made the trek to this place since we live on the other part of Bangalore . however on a Saturday afternoon we were in this part of town and we instantly decided to explore this plan. Finding this place is a bit of a challenge thanks to Google and some huge sign boards we managed to find this hidden gem.   Pros: Food food and more lip smacking food, quick good service, ample parking space. Cons: dusty surroundings , not a fine dining place so don't get ur girlfriend here on the first date unless she is missing home food :-D   The food here is the main character of this place and that's the only reason its running house full for a long time!! They have tried to make it as authentic as possible, the paratas here are simply amazing and the butter they give with them can make u feel guilty just by looking at it :-D I was hoping for some made butter but they provide amul butter though it's good but its simply not close to home made ! This is a must have here !! We also ordered some dal makhani and phulka which was pretty good but I was a bit disappointed since it was not sinful enuf to justify its name of makhani !!! I would suggest trying something else if u want the makhani sinful enuf like me !! The highlight though I didnt have but was vouched by every single member on the table was the chaas and lassi their expressions were enuf for me to believe that they were enjoying it to the core !!!  Hole in the pocket ? Not a big one its priced really well and justifies the pricing Visit again? Definitely when I am in this part of town !!"
5.0,This place is Veg Paradise. It's not Bangalore's top restaurant only because it doesn't serve Non-Veg. Never the less... It's Punjabi... It's awesome!
4.0,"This is a nice place for all the veggies once atleast. Food is good, cheap and best, lassi 1 shld must have there. No need of reservations  as they serve in good speed so one can have to wait nly few minutes if needed and rest about ambience there is nothing catchy, its a place where u can go evey 2 weeks."
5.0,"Has always been a great dining experience in Kapoor's Cafe. Any one planning to experience true Punjabi style food, please taste their best parantas and veg curries. Do not miss to order lassi, it is the true delight. A pure veg restaurant and a must visit with family, who love Punjabi food."
4.5,"Awesome authentic Punjabi food....must try the chole kulcha & masala chaas in a kullad combination for breakfast, reasonably priced. Place has a very rustic dhaba feel; adding to the surrounding. Will visit again for lunch very soon."
4.0,This place is packed with so much good energy. Really cheap and good punjabi food. Great service with people attending you in regular intervals even in a full house. They also let you carry earthen pots back home after drinking Lassi from it.  Could increase the space. Takes a lot of time for seats to be available. Also they don't take reservations.
3.5,"After a strenuous one hour badminton session,  this place seems like heaven.  Located in the campus of Gurukul sports academy,  this place is always busy.  There is wide variety of Punjabi food on the menu.  To quench our thirst we ordered a round of butter milk and Lassi which are served in nice little matki.   Moving on to the main course,  we chose Dal makhani,  paneer lababdar and mix veg along with ghee dripping chapatis which were also huge. Overall experience was quite good. Would suggest to reach this place before 12.30pm for lunch to avoid waiting, especially during weekends."
5.0,Really nice north Indian food. Dhaba like ambience and presentation of the food is probably one of the best things about this place. I loved the light phulkas. The parathas and curries are amazing. Also one of the best vegetarian restaurants in the area.
3.0,I heard about this restaurant from my colleagues . They told me its a must visit place for a foodie like me. Also i checked there rating on Zomato it was 4.0. According to me this place is waste of money. Service was very poor. Food items are overpriced. They sell themselves as the best lassi in town but it was more like an ice cream than lassi.
4.5,"Being a Punjabi, I can say the food they serve is full of punjabiness. You won't find many places where you can get a good dish made with paneer. But here the paneer is super soft what I get in Delhi. And the sweet kesar lassi is super awesome. Must go place if you want to try a real Punjabi food."
4.0,"VALUE FOR THE MONEY I never knew a quality dhaba is available so near to my house. Its in thubrahalli hardly 250mtrs from kundanahalli gate. We went at around 9:30 on Sunday evening assuming dhaba will be almost empty but to our surprise we got the waiting list 67. It seems this one in the fav list of many people.  We ordered few veg gravy which was ok but the main attraction was Parathas, Parathas tasted awesome and the quantity of butter over it reminded me of Punjab. And these parathas are economical too RS 40/RS 60. Staffs were well behaved and the owner at the counter made sure to get your feedback about the food. MUST TRY : Gobi Paratha,, Allu Paratha. Khasta Roti was also good.  Will definitely visit this place regularly for the parathas."
4.0,"This was on my wishlist since a year actually. for whatever reason, landed after a year on Saturday night and was great. Between my hubby and me, ordered kulcha, paneer Labrador, mushroom Masala, Dal makhni, parathas, Matar pulao and Shahi Tukda. Loved everything except the paratha and found Shahi Tukda average. But the rest was yum yum yum. The service was friendly too. Especially loved the smile of the uncle at the cash counter."
4.5,"If you are looking for north Indian taste then your search will end here. Relish your tongue with mouth watering chhole bhature and parathas. They serve lassi in ""kulhad"" (earthen handle-less cup) and its very good in taste and thickness."
4.5,"Kapoors caf is the quintessential rustic Punjabi dhaba hidden in Thubarahalli village. Keep an eye for the turn to Kapoors caf, I missed it once, and had to take a U turn. Dont go here for the ambiance, dont go here for the service, dont go here expecting class. Go here for some good Punjabi Dhaba food. Excellent food. I cant stop comparing this place to the Bobby Dhaba (next to Gurduwara) in its hay days. Its as good or may be better.  I like the setup of the place- can get pretty hot though as it is roofed by ACC sheets. Also the parking space is good, fear not to search for a place to park. Now, to the food. We ordered Chaas, Assorted Pakoras, Paneer Paratha, Paneer Labbadar, and missi Roti. I loved the Chaas- couldnt resist with a single portion. The pakoras were an assortment of onion and paneer. For me the Onion stood out, I thought the Paneer pakoras could be of smaller chunks-personal opinion.  The Paneer Paratha was my pick of the day. It went well with the salted home made butter. Kapoors are generous with the butter. Keep set to hit the thread mill for the rest of the week.   Paneer Labbadar was good  nothing high/low about it. All in all, a wonderful dhaba experience right in Bengalurus concrete jungle. For the quality of the food, joy on the taste buds, and, quick service this place is very humbling on the wallet. I would go back again and again."
5.0,"Absolute deliciousness. That's all this place is about. If you want to eat REAL homemade Punjabi food, this is the place to go. It is a no-fuss, quick service, dhaba style place with finger-licking vegetarian food. All the stuffed parathas are filling, dals & subjis like made by mom, chole bature is decadent and baingan bharta is simply divine. They are generous in their servings and also with their ""makkhan"" :) So vegans will have to specify no butter. In any case, it serves food as comforting as a mom's hug."
4.0,Small place full dhaba like feeling in delhi ishtyle. Had heard lots about the food here and yes its fab! If you stay near whitefield this is a mustgo place for all the foodies craving for aloo da paratha. They give awesome kullad chai with aloo paratha makkhan maarke. Infact you can try the lassi they give even in the kullad. People can also try the kachori aloo which is fab again. The only issue here is they charge a lot for the kind of food they serve but its still worth a visit. Ambiance: 3 Food:4.5 Price: Expensive
3.5,"If you are punjabi and not tasted Kapoor's cafe then a visit or stay in Bangalore is bekaar..  From Lassi to Parathas to Aloo Poori..evey item gives you a touch of punjab.  Conceptually it is not too costly..ambience is desi but very nice,all necessarily factors for a foodie is taken care from cleanliness to hospitality purpose..  Service gets delayed sometimes during peak hours..but the food kills the frustation of waiting time.."
4.5,"Taste of the food is influenced by what you see,  hear and feel.  Kapoor's Cafe is one of those unique places which were pleasant to all my senses. The staff is extremely courteous and we'll mannered.  Very well maintained place, every part of it is clean and hygienic.  And last but not the least sumptuous food with Punjabi songs made my experience of a Punjabi dhaba complete!  Thick kulhad Lassi,  chaas and finger licking dhaba di daal are must try foods here . Also this  place is known for its extremely full filling and utterly butterly delicious paranthas!"
4.5,"Its a very small place, few minutes away from thubarhallli bus-stop,didnt expect such amazing tasty food and quality from this place, jus loved it. Worth the amount, quantity is more than enough and the service is very quick.chaas is sooo good, boondi raitha too,oh no everything is soo good here :p,it will not disappoint u, Should try this place!! :D"
4.5,"I don't really do vegetarian food but Kapoor's cafe changed my perspective on it. The food is hearty, rich and finger licking good. The price is reasonable and the owners are very welcoming. It never feels like one is dining out in a restaurant while you're there. The owners make it a point to make sure it feels like an extension of your personal dining room while you're there. Keep going team :)"
3.0,Feeling homesick?? This place reminds me of 'ghar ka khana' flavour. Very reasonable and for paratha lovers this is the perfect place Punjabi khasta paratha being my fav.
4.5,An amazing place to find some mouthwatering north Indian delicacies. Ambience wise it gives a descent feel but the food is awesome here. Have been struggling to find quite descent place with some tasty north Indian recipes...Definitely there's a next time...
5.0,One of the best places for Punjabi food. The service is good. But the time taken to get a place for dining is too much despite the huge number of tables and efficient waiters. The food here is really good. Classic Punjabi style food. I loved this place and I have visited this place a lot of times. This is one of the places that is hidden but really worth visiting.
4.0,Don't judge book by its cover just enter and enjoy authentic Punjabi food. People searching for awesome paranthas this is must try place. And the music ..oye hoye..u will definitely enjoy your food.
4.0,"Kapoor's Cafe is a real treat for all the people who love punjabi food. Their overly sized paranthas are the best treat one can have with a dollop of butter to top it up.  We also ordered lassi, paneer pakoras, paneer butter masala and daal makhani along with some rotis and naans. The food here is as good as any dhaba in Punjab. The only disappointment was Lassi. Having tasted the real punjabi lassi, this was nowhere close to it but still you can have one to accompany the food.  Would definitely visit this place again for there Jumbo Paranthas...just loved them.  P.S. Please open another branch in Indiranagar or Koramangala so that all the Punjabi food lovers in these area can enjoy your food more frequently. :D"
4.0,Dhabha + Paratha + Bangalore weather is pure bliss. The place lives up to more than my expectations. Food is amazing and service is fast once you get past the initial hurdle of getting a table. Would definitely go back again for many more of those mouth watering parathas.
4.0,Heard about this hotel through a friend and decided to go for dinner.. Initial verdict was not a fancy looking restaurant with hardly any interiors.. But owner has concentrated more on food than looks.. And food is damn good.. Everything was so rich in butter :-) paratha had so much butter on top that I could bathe in it.. But still gooooood.. Best part of meal was chaas and lassi. Too good.
4.0,"The moment I entered the cafe, I was greeted with a warm welcome and I got the whole Punjab vibe because of the ambiance and the crowd.I ordered the lassi first which was absolutely delicious. One must try the lassi here. Then I had the assorted pakoras from which I liked the paneer pakora more than the alu pyaaz pakora. For main course, I had shahi pulao, mushroom masala and Punjabi dal tadka. Everything was delicious and filling. I wanted to try the desserts but I was full with the main course. Next time I'm definitely looking forward to try the desserts. A must visit place :)"
4.5,"It took me to my Punjab days in every bite. I was waiting for long for this taste, finally I landed in Kapoor's Cafe, after trying multiple north Indian restaurants in Bangalore. My search ends here. I am sure, in a month or 2, I would taste all the dishes they serve. Simply loved Paneer lababdar and dhaba style daal. Lassi I didn't like, it was not close to Punjab. Aloo Paratha stuffing was different than authentic Punjab ones, but liked the taste. Overall, I am going to come back at least twice every week. Thanks...."
5.0,"Very good food , double good hospitality... I was amaze they take care for u ... Too good food totally fresh and yummy ... It was perfect place with value for money"
4.0,"Been to this place with my friends for lunch.The place was crowded..by knowing about this we have already reserved the table..We started our order by ordering lassi which is the served in the pot. Service was fast,and taste wise also the food was good.A good place to have north Indian veg food.."
4.5,Decent place with good food at very nominal price but service is slow. It takes them about 20 minutes to get the order to the table. Do expect waiting time as well because of the show service.
5.0,"Coming from the city of nawabs, you crave good north indian food. Well look no more, this is the place. I just cant get enough of their paranthas, lassi, chaas and paneer pakodas. This is still far fetched delicacies in Bangalore. But even there basic dal, qloo ki sabji thali is to die for. The first day i went there i was tempted by the food on the neighbors table. It is that mouth watering."
4.5,"Oye paaji,pet bhar gaya si..ample amount of sabji..nice soft phulke..cold thick curd..aur oye hoye shahi tukda..maza aa gaya..one thing I wanba say, water jugs was oily..other than that everything awesome..nd not to forget fab hospitality...no one should a dhaba like this in Bangalore...loved it.."
4.5,"Oye Paaji, Tussi mujhe pehle kyun nahi mile :)  You dont go back to a place on two consecutive days to have a meal unless you like it so much that you just cant resist it. This was the case with me with this place. Authentic Punjabi Food is a rarity anywhere, and when you lay your hands on it you just want to have more of it.  So on Day 1 I had the Dal Combo here. The Aloo Jeera was just cooked perfectly. The Potatoes were perfectly cooked and the Jeera part was just heavenly. The Dal was tasty and went very well with the rice. The salad along with it just made it a complete meal. Also getting good buttermilk in Bangalore is a big issue. And what we had here was just amazing  Day 2: Having had a meal, on day 2 i was craving for some buttery thing. So ordered Aloo Paratha and Aloo Pyaaz Paratha. My God. They were just what you want to be. A big paratha with great potato stuffing with a load full of butter on top of it. Generally in lot of places the aloo is missing in the parathas or let me say hardly present. But here it was just beautiful. The paneer pakodas were also just extremely tasty. To finish it of a well balanced Lassi. What more can you ask for.  The staff is so friendly. You get all the love like they are your own family. It has a very modern dhaba type look. And the music which is being played in the background. By God just makes the atmosphere so amazing. A must visit place if you love punjab food.  P.S.: Be early or else you will have to wait, not too long though"
5.0,"Loved food over here,dont forget to take lassi......aaloo paratha with makkahan is awesome.......................... truely authentic !!!!!!"
4.5,Desi north indian food.Loved it. I loved the parathas. I must say haven't yet ate such tasty and delicious parathas anywhere else in Bangalore. A Must place to dine.:) . Yes don't miss out the dry fruit lassi. Don't go over there for sabzis. Try some dry stuff. :P
4.0,"I was told about Kapoor's cafe by a lot of friends but never had the chance to to go until today... We went as a group of 5  friends. We had paneer pakora, assorted pakora for starters. Pakoras were good but not great..  The portion sizes though are very generous. Then for the main course we had missi rotis, cheese paratha, chilly onion khastha paratha, kulcha and aloo paratha.. The sizes are enormous and taste wise- lip smackingly good. The subjis we had were veg tadka, which was OK, and paneer degchi delhiwale- this was gorgeous. The matka lassj was just great... The appearance of the caf is very  simplistic. But the food makes up for the deficiency in the ambiance. Overall it was an enjoyable experience. Would definitely recommend it to friends.   Note: Calorie conscious people please be warned that food is very rich."
4.5,"I have been to the place thrice . One of the favorite place where you can find pure authentic Punjabi food. On the cash counter the Uncle is too good , We being girls for the first we went were taken care of to be delivering order in time as it was night time.  I being a Punjabi can assure you guys that if you are missing homely food, This is the right place that can be your Mother's kitchen.  A wow experience it is when you see pudina dhaniya chutney on the table and Kulad wali Chaach (Butter Milk) . Yummy - is the word."
4.0,Paratha n lassi dat to in banglr...kapoor's d best...lov d way dey use to giv lassi in khulahr...pocket friendly...a perfect place to have differnt verities of paratha..panner fired pockets are supb...liked it soo much...
4.0,nice food.. very fast service for a friday service.. food is tasty and makes u dig in as soon as u get. only thing that i saw was that the waiter who took the order did.not tell.us we were ordering more than wat we can eat. but rest is very good
5.0,"The place my friends and I bumped into while searching for a casual dining place. Though the ambience is no delight, the food completely compensates for it. Everything in the menu proves to be drooling. Service earns even extra points. Need not care about your pocket while visiting the place. You can eat till you drop but do leave some place for the amazing lassi to complete the meal. Undoubtedly one of the best places to serve north indian food. :)"
4.0,"Woow..!! Amazing place for north Indian food. There are so many varieties. The best item to try are dry fruit lassi, paranthas, kheer and chole bhature. You can go for any of the combos. Just one downside is the place itself which gives you the feel of a dhaba but gets really crowdy and uncomfortable."
1.0,"My first review at Zomato and am not happy it being a negative. Heard a lot about this place & been waiting to try their breakfast.First thing which is not Delhi\Punjabi style is starting breakfast at 10 AM. This was the biggest reason for me to take many months before I could try this place. Went there for a take-away. Ordered their Chole bhature, puri aloo, puri chole & kachore aloo. Nothing was a delight. Chole bhature were average. Puri were too thick. Lastly Kachori's were a DISASTER. That's the word. They were nothing like a kachori but a THICK half done puri of some kind. I can bet if that thing is served without a name then anyone will pass it for a some novice cooking puris. On top of it there was something seriously wrong with the food... may be oil or what but my whole family has been having a very uncomfortable feeling since morning.  May be lunch\dinner is better but now I don't have a courage to try this place again."
4.5,"This place has authentic Punjabi cuisine and ambience. If you want to transport yourself to your favourite street side joint in Delhi, Chandigarh or Ludhiana while physically remaining in Bangalore, this is a good bet. Menu includes various tasty stuffed paranthas, grilled sandwiches, punjabi meal combos and also full fledged vegetarian dishes and curries along with delectable rice preparations. Lassi and chaach served in earthen vessels, white butter, steel utensils and a very courteous service add to the experience. Decor is based on theme of a typical mid scale Punjabi restaurant with focus on enjoying good food without much of distracting sophistication. Place is usually rather happily noisy but I have always found good well mannered crowd at this place. Families, bachelor gangs, students you can see all of them here. Cost side its not very pricey with around rs. 300 per head for a filling lunch/dinner.  Locating it can be dicey as there's no board on the main road by the name Kapoor cafe. You need to look for board of gurukul academy and enter the same."
4.5,"Recently been there with friends on a saturday night. It was 10 to 7 and was not open. But the manager was kind enough to let us in and wait until it was officially open.  We ordered the parathas as I've heard they are famous here and i was not disappointed. Aloo paratha, gobi paratha, cheese paratha were all really yummy. Their mint chutney adds to the taste. The quantity is not too much not too less.  The sandwiches were not very good. They seemed a little dry.  The service was pretty good. The waiters were courteous and were also patient to note specifics for the order.  The highlight of the place is their name board that attracted us from the main road. Their ambience is very simple but nice.  Pricing was also very nominal. I saw a lot of families coming in after 8 which indicates their popularity.  Overall a good experience!"
4.0,"Excellent Punjabi food, reasonably priced. Try Specialty dishes and Frensh fries in punjabi style. You'll fall in love for its Lassi. Paneer pakoda seems to be very delicious and famous here. Usually crowded any day of the week, ambiance is kind of dhaba type with iron shed. It was lil bit hot inside but since food tastes awesome you'll ignore all other things.."
4.5,"Finally writing the review after my second visit, was dubious after my first visit about this place. My earlier visit was when it was raining cats and dogs, everything was mismanaged, the roof was leaking and many were waiting outside to get a place to sit,but yes the FOOD was authentic Punjabi and was great, so gave a second visit. So here comes the review of these visits... Food:4.5/5 Tried panner butter masala,dal tadka,khasta parantha, pudina khasta partha, missi roti,aloo pyaaj parantha paneer parantha,and oh yes Cheese parantha and Lassi. Each and everything tasted great but yaa somethings were a bit more spicy to my liking. But overall the FOOD was great. Ambiance: 3.5/5 No specific complaints here but this joint is so popular and many a times you have to stand to just get a seat is problematic plus the seating could have been made more comfortable. Service 4/5 The service was prompt and OK.  Overall if you want to try good Punjabi food this place is surely to be in the top of your bucket list...  EDIT 2: I have been to this place for around a dozen times so I think I can summarize the dining experience.The food is GREAT.. No complaint in this department ever.But from all these visits I would like to suggest few things to the management: ->I felt the service is quite slow.I know good food takes time to cook and no time to eat, still if you guys could just speed up the service time, it would be great.->The billing procedure: The counter system is acceptable provided we don't have to provide the table number we sat on.->I basically took my friends this time to try the new rolls section but they wanted to sit inside and eat, it would be great if you could serve the rolls inside as when I inquired i was told it is only to be ordered outside.Overall you guys are serving great food and hope this continues."
3.0,"I had heard so much about this place but i guess i walked in on a bad day. We were a bunch of girls and we went there for lunch.  I ordered rajama combo, my friend ordered Chole bhatoore combo. Other one ordered Paneer combo(if i remember correctly) and baigan bharta.  The Rajama was horrible and guess what had the same taste like the chole on the other plate. The bhatoora was not upto par and i have had better . Though the Aloo fry in the combo was good. Our friend told that she have had better rajma chole experience here, we concluded may be today was just bad day. But we ended our meal with dryfruit malai thing(i don't remember the name) , but that was heavenly.  While paying the bill , Kapoor uncle lovingly asked about the food and we gave our feedback which he gracefully accepted.  I will visit again for sure to get the authentic punjabi taste i heard so much about."
3.5,Had heard a lot abt the place...ordered kadhai paneer.dhabe ki daal and phulka...paneer was decent...dal was pretty awsm n tasted like a good dhaba daal is.. Phulka was disappointing.. It was hard n stiff...wil try other dishes...a good optn...
4.5,"Practically everything they serve is super tasty ! Authentic Punjabi cuisine and proper dhaba interiors spiced up with Punjabi music. We visited them twice last week.  Parathe served with butter and green chatni are must try here. My favorite are 'Aloo pyaaz paratha', they also have awesome and fulling combos.  For vegetarians this place is a paradise.  Food- 4.8/5 Ambiance- 3.7/5 Service- 4/5 VFM- 4.8/5"
4.5,"In this IT city exploring the food outlets from last 4 years, I did not get anything near to authentic Punjabi cuisine. But, that's my luck you can say got an invitation on their 1st anniversary the Kapoor's cafe. I thought it's a casual dhaba before step in. After I occupied a table I got to know about the hospitality level they are maintaining. Mr. senior Kapoor or Kapoor uncle as we all calling them with immense love have more experience than a senior level manager of a 5-star property in handling hospitality outlets. So, he trained his sons to take care of the guest like a family member. You can't feel you are in a restaurant at any point of time apart from the bill payment (on a lighter note). I am talking about the hospitality standard and guest handling technology. But sorry guys you will not get any type of nonveg dishes here after a hardcore Punjabi restaurant not serving nonveg which is the heart of Punjabi cuisine. But their veg delicacies are so yummy you will forget nonveg I can assure you that.   I went with my cousin. We started our meal from dry fruit lassi so amazing with roasted dry fruits really crunchy while chewing.   Then the kalmi Punjabi sticks. So crunchy and yummy while writing also I have to wipe off my face.  In the main we got some Dhabe di dal. All recipes are from Aunty (Mrs. Kapoor) I can say just one thing as a chef I made so many types of dal and as a critic I have tasted so many. But this dal just out of the world. I can open challenge the pro chefs to compete with this standard. I forgot to tell about Paneer lababdar, Khasta paratha which came with 4 layers and some shahi pulao.   We ended up our meal with Chawal di kheer and Fruit cream (Kapoor's special). You will doubt me why I am saying about fruit cream in a Punjabi restaurant. Because the cream was homemade yes, guys the cream was not bought from outside market. You have to taste it for sure.  Bon Appetite @ Chef BB                                             chefbb.in"
4.0,Well you can see the popularity of this restaurant by the number of people waiting outside at anytime! Amazing prathas and lassi! Do try out cheese pratha for sure! And quite a cheap place for a proper North Indian lunch!  Ps: one of the best vegetarian north Indian restaurant!
4.5,"Awesome food joint for authentic punjabi cuisine. I mostly prefer pure veg restaurants and hence I landed at this place after going through its ratings and reviews on Zomato. Ambiance is very simple like that of any road side Dhabas. I never bothered abt the same as far as my supper is awesome. Little improvement is required in terms of cleanliness. Or else for quality of food, Taste, and owners of the restaurant I would give 5 + ratings."
4.5,The punjabi taste here is devine... Tried just the parathas... lots of makkhan oozing. The buttermilk is also great. The owners and waiters are good..  welcome with a smile.  Surely worth visiting again and again.
4.5,Had been on a Saturday evening. Got a table in around 15-20 minutes. Food was very delicious and the price is very pocket friendly. The staff and owner were very cordial. I was also surprised with the quick preparation of the dishes inspite of the packed restaurant. Highly recommended.
2.0,After reading lots of +ve reviews decided to try this place. First on arrival realized parking is a huge issue and nobody to navigate or assist. Managed to get a decent parking and was happy to see large crowds waiting which denoted food is good. After a good ten mins waiting we were shown to a corner table next to which a group of friends were celebrating a birthday. Let me explain the ambience ... Its an asbestos sheet huge hall with basic wooden tables and metal chairs. Tables so close to each other that you can practically hear every ones conversations etc etc. We ordered one combo which had everything and parathas with veg kholapuri. We asked for tandoori roti and we were shocked to learn that in this so called punjabi restaurant they had no tandoor this was a huge disappointment. We had to settle with pulka since at 8:40 kulcha was also over. The main reason for this low rating is the hygiene- the guy preparing the fruit lassi was very dirty and their were lizards crawling around the chopped onions. The sink was stinking and food was also not tasty in fact it was the hygiene that was a big put off. The bill is directly at the counter and I reminded the waiter twice for my shahi tukda and no response. After getting fed up waiting and  mosquitos biting gave up and paid the bill. It was 600 which was definitely not worth it. A definite no no if u r looking for s cleaner hygienic decent calm place to eat.
4.5,The best part about this place is you can go anytime for breakfast or lunch or dinner. The ambience is too good and gives u a touch of proper DHABA. Cheese paratha is a must try with dry fruit lassi. And shahi tukda is awesome too. In short you can hit this place multiple times with your friends.
5.0,The best Punjabi food I had in Bangalore. I would recommend the parathas. ALU pyaz and paneer are the must haves. Do try the butter milk. Thts amazing. Overall an awesome experience and a treat to the taste buds.. Will definitely visit again.
4.0,"Few places in Bangalore serve pure veg north Indian cuisine; this is one of them and still is extremely popular among people - Zomato rating signifies the same! Coming down to business, this place serves pretty good Punjabi food - taste of the food served is altered slightly to make it better suited for Bangloreans (read health conscious) i.e. it's not a whole lot spicy, not a whole lot of ghee/oil is used as compared with food served in Punjab. I personally am more inclined towards the latter one - a bit more spicy (can compromise on healthy stuff once in a while - after all who goes to a restaurant everyday?). So, I think the place is just a tad hyped. Ambience - it isn't great. One wouldn't really visit this place again for it's ambience for sure. It's a kind of shed and probably would've been called ""Kapoor's dhabha"" if it were in Punjab. As I earlier pointed out, there is a thoughtful effort to make it better suited for Bangloreans and probably that's why Kapoor's Cafe! Finally, it's not too heavy on the pocket - I'd categorize this more towards most pocket friendly than towards the opposite side of the range. To sum things up, one can visit this place more than once, especially north Indians."
4.0,"Great food. We tried Veg Kadhai, plain fulka and paratha. All were good. Veg kadhai was little on the spicy side, however taste was great. Lassi was ok. Shahi tukda and fruit cream were very good. Service was good. Would love to visit again."
4.5,This place has received a lot of appreciation from food lovers for the last year or so. They serve a special sweet lassi in a medium sized Kulhad and it tastes really good. The parathas are soaked with butter and you feel complete after having 1 paratha. All items taste homely. Try some spicy main course here with missi roti or butter fulka. I bet you can't stop even after you eat your daily dose of dinner. You can try the kheer among desserts. My personal ratings - Value for money - 4 Ambiance - 3.5 Service - 4.5 Food - 4.5 Overall - 4.5
4.5,"One such place, which is somewhere around the busiest circuits of the city (Kundanahalli) and actually designed to be Dhaba style (Seems like an old building just designed for this, Coolers surrounding the window, something way too different - You are probably not in Bangalore). But, then I must say, ""What a Parantha place!! These people make one of the best paranthas and lassi in the city. Triple thick and mouth watering from the very first look. Like true punjabis, their parathas are awesomely filled with no place left. They keep up to their words ""No Kanjoosi"" in Butter and filling! Couldn't have more than two (Some just had one). Lassi is amazing and thick. If I had to rate only for food, it would be 5/5.Finally one place which is vegetarian but does attract a lot of non-veg crowd too, and end up saying ""Am coming back here soon"" !"
5.0,"One thing comes in mind - ""Authentic delicious Punjabi food"".   One lazy Thursday we decided to have dinner at this place. To my surprise we saw a big queue. I waited for about 30 mint. Well I could only try few dishes   1. Plain paratha   2. Dal Makhni  3. Paneer burji  4. Fresh Fries (Punjabi style) - Fusion  5. Baigon bharta   6. Lassi  Well after testing the food I realized that why it's crowded even on a Thursday. Food is delicious. Though it's a pure veg restaurant, I would say if you like punjabi food give it a try.   Service : 3/5 - Need improvement, there is always rush, so service is a bit slow  Food : 5/5 - The best Punjabi dhaba style food, foods are made with love  Hygiene : 4/5 - Need a better washroom and hand-wash place Staff : 5/5  Ambiance : 4/5 - Kind of dhaba style.  Location : You could easily miss the sign board. It's in Gurukul academy campus on the left side.   Parking : Small entrance, kind of enough place for parking.  Quantity : More than enough.  Over the couple of weekends whenever I would think of having outside food, I would like to try all of the dishes in their menu.  Don't just read this review, Try this place and give it a high five.. (5 Star)"
4.5,Glad to see they can manage crowd very smoothly.smoothly. Lassi is a must have. What a Parantha experience!! These people make one of the best paranthas in the city. Cheese Parantha is triple layered and mouth watering from the very first look Ambience is ok. Must visit place !! :)
5.0,"One of the best food joint for vegetarians. Fast service , good management and above all excellent food. Ambience too is decent and lively. Great experience :)"
5.0,"Rightly awarded taste of India by Zomato! Kapoor's Cafe has a superb Punjabi taste and is one of those very few restaurants in bangalore where you get a combo of taste + affordability!  Food is authentic ""Ghar ka khaana"" and served hot. Service is excellent. Polite staff and always smiling even with fussy customers. Although the place is small but the food and service make up for it.  Paraathas with slab of butter, lassi/chaas, baigan ka bharta and all paneer stuff is really lipsmacking! Delicious food :)"
4.5,"Great service, good food...an authentic punjabi place which I had read about and went with family for a lazy sunday lunch today. The chaanch in the kulhad is unique. Parathas are well stuffed...tasty combinations...we had cheese, aloo onion, mixed. My 9 yr old was drooling over the paneer butter.  The place was crowded being a weekend but it has a lot of covers, so hopefully you wont be waiting for long.   Being true non vegs, must say its One of the few veggie places we liked!!!"
4.5,"One of the highly recommended place for north indian cuisine!.   Best place to have chole bature in Bangalore so far..... Other items also good.... Quantity is sufficient rather i would say its more than sufficient..... Must try: Cheese Paranthas, Chole Bature Sahi Tukda, Lassi"
4.5,"So this is what we call authentic north indian / punjabi food. I have been to this place twice and both the times the experience has been great. We ate paranthas (which were very delicious desi style with lot of butter), Dal makhani is as awesome as possible and rest everything was also good. special mention: Do try Lassi and Butter Milk in kulhad.  Service is good and fast. Although it is a small place but always crowded with queue.  must visit."
4.0,This cafe is in the same complex as is the Gurukul Sports academy in Thurabarahalli. As you enter it may not be too appealing but the food is amazing!!! We tried the chole bhature - they served it with alu sabzi and hari chutney which was amazing!!! One of the few places that serves great north Indian food at very good prices.
4.0,"This is just like any of those perfect Punjabi highway dhabas . We ordered lassis, missi and plain paranthas, kulche, shahi paneer, dal tadka and paneer lababdar as it was 6 of us. Each n every dish was delicious n filling. It came out to be roughly 200 per head and we were all full ! This place proves that veg food isn't as bad as we (hardcore non vegetarians) think it is. Also, the place will always be busy so be patient you'll get a table in 15 mins ."
5.0,Awesome place with great hospitality.Authentic Punjabi food in bangalore.Went 4times but still want to go.Though mostly I prefer nonveg but I can compromise wid dat for Kapoor's Cafe.
4.0,The food was good. Have had better Punjabi food and somehow without non veg Punjabi food feels incomplete. But the staff is super friendly and efficient. And the person on the billing desk is so courteous and always gets you with a smile. Good experience overall. Medium costly. And of course awesome lassi
4.0,Been here a few times with friends. The owner is a humble guy who along with his father runs this place. Food is just Punjab-istic. Very close to the authentic punjabi food. Do try sweet lassi and chole bhatura. The place has a setup of a dhabha which goes really well with the food they serve.
5.0,"I've visited Kapoor's cafe just twice in the past one year due to it's location,but those two time have left an indelible impression on me.This is a place for authentic Punjabi food and gives a Dhaba like feel.I think it is a restaurant build in a warehouse so don't expect much in terms of fancy china or furniture but the place is very neat and tidy. The food is really really really good and worth every penny.The Shahi tukda and Paneer Degchi is a must try.Paneer Parantha has always been my favourite here.But the Sweet Lassi takes the cake. It is hands down the best thing I've ever tasted anywhere. The ambience is good and service is sublime. Looking forward to have ""makki di roti"" and ""sarson da saag"" in the winters or whenever it will be available. P.S..We were too busy stuffing ourselves so I don't have any photos.!!!"
5.0,"It is Tuesday night 9:45 PM and we had to wait for fifteen minutes before we could get a table. The food is very delicious. If you are anywhere near Whitefield, you have to visit without fail. If you are anywhere else, it really depends on how much you crave for tasty north Indian food. Lassi is the best I ever had. Rich and tasty! Definite recommend! Cheers!"
4.0,"We visited this place after being recommended by a Facebook Page and i must say it is over our expectations. It's a tiny place and you might have to wait for at least 15 mins on weekends but what comes next is worth the wait. We really loved the aloo pyaz parantha here and the added bonus is that they serve it with white butter, something not usually seen. It reminds us of a place near delhi famous for its paranthas (Murthal). Apart from this, their panner dishes are full of flavours, they serve it with tawa roti as the tandoor oven is currently not installed. But the taste remains same. Desserts are pretty decent too.  We never missed north indian food after visiting this place. I would recommend to try their pranthas for sure no matter at what time you visit this place. They can work a little towards the ambience, but the price you pay for such delicious meal overcomes everything."
4.5,Had just heard from my friends about the actual Punjabi food.. how they serve Lassy and paratha..had a glimpse of it.. try cheesy paratha too.. triple layer cheese..a must try dish.. never thought I can like a veg restaurant.
5.0,"Super parathas, outstanding!!! There are many good things about this place, you must come and experience. Truly fulfilling meal.. The best part is to see the hosts smiling throughout.. This place's got a very positive vibe. A must try! And no taxes :) what you see is what you pay for.."
3.5,"When you go here, stick to basic, order simple paratha, bagaan bharta, lassi...that's it...lovely food...fast service...I found it's costly compared to the ambiance...but quality of the veg food is very good"
4.5,"If u want to have prpoer North Indian food, there are very few places in Bangalore better than this. Aaloo & Gobhi paranthas are a must try. Very authentic, very tasty.."
2.0,"Just like many others even I was searching for some real good parantha point in Bangalore (as I am from Haryana so I just love them) and came across Kapoor's. And I was so amazed by such nice comments and rating of the restaurant that I couldn't resist myself BUT I guess all those comments are either paid or fake....!!!  I just can't understand on what basis people rate and comment about restaurants.  So here's my experience ::  PROS ==>  1. Butter lovers just go for it. (enough quantity of butter is served with each parantha).  2. Size and stuffing of parantha was good.  3. Way of dealing the customers was nice.  CONS ===> (quite a long list)  1. Stuffing used was just tasteless, it felt like they just boiled the potato's and used them without any salt, masala, or any kind of preparation..  2. No complementary salad,  curd, pickle was provided. Only green chutney was served that too in limited quantity.  3. We were made to ask 3 - 4 times for extra chutney bowl.  4. Table was not proper, it was shaking.  5. There was just Boondi & Curd in Boondi raita, NOT even Salt was mixed, leave about other toppings. And moreover salt was Not kept on table. Again we need to ask them. Believe me, far better raita you can prepare at your home.  6. After seeing all this we couldn't gather enough courage to order Lassi or Chaach.  7. No arrangement for people who were waiting outside, i saw many people leaving just because of this reason.  8. Very Very Over Priced.  Suggestions for Kapoor's Kafe ::  1. Please taste food before serving.  2. At least keep salt on every table.  3. Either reduce your price or raise quality standard.  4. Provide some salad with your over priced items."
4.0,"The search for authentic paranthas takes me places. Kapoor's cafe was one such discovery. And a great one. I would definitely go here again to try their other paranthas.  Their paranthas are delicious, to say the least. The chola bhatura is not that great. The lassi is heavenly! The Shahi Tukra is also great. The service is fast too. And I am sorry but I don't see the ambiance when the paranthas are so great! And for those like me going there for the first time, it's inside Gurukul sports academy and is not easily found from google maps or main road."
4.5,A nice place... Sry nice food I should say...cause only thing they provide good is food. Don't expect in nice ambience cozy sofa seat or so..its a dhaba..but whatever I tasted It was good. Service.. U have to wait wait n wait first wait fr seat ..den for food but wen it comes u wouldn't be disappointed. Try avoiding on weekend night.. Or be prepared for long queue
3.5,"Went here on a Sunday. Since it's close to the gurukul sports complex, I guess it would always be crowded with hungry athletes. They don't have air conditioners, so it was quite hot around 11.30 am.  Food - we ordered a bunch of breakfast items like paneer bread pakoras, chhole bhature, buttermilk, lassi and almost all of the dishes were good. Chhole masala wasn't watery, had the right taste. Service - They took more than 20 min to serve poori chhole, so we canceled it. Btw, the staff is friendly.  Items aren't overpriced here, but for a place with no air conditioning and no special ambiance, some of them items on the menu could have been cheaper. However, there's a dearth of good north indian eateries in Marathahalli. So, this is a must-try."
4.0,Everything is good is here. They are very generous when it comes to the butter.  Wish it had non veg food. Parathas are awesome. Lassi ek dum jhakaas. Combos are damn good as well.
4.0,"A no frills place. I would say a functional dhaba with good food. The owners, who also run the place, are very professional and warm. You visit this place when you want a quick nice meal without having to dent your wallet"
4.0,"Come here for just food, authentic dilli-food. We loved the buttermilk served in kulhad. Aloo and gobhi parathans were nicely stuffed and large. I was so enjoying the food, that I ordered a chhole-bhature also. However, that came as a disappointment. Though the chhole were delicious, bhature on the contrary were oily, very oily. Please avoid it. Tea in kulhads was great again. Prices are very very nominal. Such great food at such pocket-friendly prices is unbelievable in Bengaluru. And yes, don't come looking for an ambience here. It is a little hard to locate with an unclear signboard on the main road. And when you find it also, you may still not be sure if you have reached the right place. It is a simple dhaba-setup. I would have rated it 5, had I not tried the bhature. But yes, it's a must visit!"
5.0,"If you are a person who cares JUST about the good food, this issssss the place! Amazing food! So much like home at extremely decent prices!  Must haves:  Panneer burji Corn masala Panneer paratha Aloo paratha Sweet lassi"
5.0,"Indeed the best place for North Indian Food. Pls try their lassi... Its out of the world.. Though veg, it attracted my attention and I royally belted those delicious Paneer pakoda. Chole bhature was too good with two bhaturas. Amazing. Coming soon !!! :D"
4.0,One of the best punjabi food i have eaten in bengalore. Very good value for money food & courteous staff too. Concept of lassi in a small earthen pot is new & refreshing.
5.0,The feel of the hotel is good!!! The food was awesome with lots of butter on the aloo pyaz parathas!!! Surely recommend to a veggie friend as the best Punjabi veg arguably in Bangalore!! #homelyfood.
4.0,"We had gone there on Friday evening.  Unfortunately the electricity was absent in the area. It was difficult to spot the place. The restaurant was located a bit inside. Finally, got there and found a ware house converted to restaurant. The inside of the restaurant is very different from vicinity. The moment you enter you will hear popular Punjabi songs, see bright lights and a lot of crowd. We took the table at centre. For first round we ordered chaas and lassi. They both were heavenly. Then we ordered parathas- paneer, aaloo, gobhi. The parathas came loaded with butter. The size was sumptuous. I think 1 paratha filled up our hunger. But we still  ordered 1/2 for each of us. The Parantha were good, filling was well distributed and nicely complemented with achaar. The best part was the bill- 800 for 5people or 160 per person was very pocket friendly. Would come back to try other dishes."
5.0,"Well well my first 5 rating.. N of course they deserve it. Just had lunch there..  I'm a punjabi n vry particular about my food but they nailed it  yumm lassi, pakoras, paranthas n poori sabzi.. Glad to see that they can manage weekend crowd also so smoothly.. We kept on ordering in between and they kept on serving without any delay.. Yummy yummy in my tummy"
4.0,Visit this place for authentic north Indian Punjabi food. The chola bhature and kachori are really nice. Lassi is a must have. Ambience is ok.
5.0,Awesome restaurant for vegies people.... Must go if you want to have typical north Indian + panjabi taste..... Must try butter milk and lassi..... Try parantha in place of roti....
4.0,"I'm writing this review after 3 visits to this place. No doubt this comes in the high rated places. Each time, the dishes we ordered were all very tasty...OMG!!! how could I forget to mention the butter served with each paratha...the butter served with one would be sufficient with 2 or 3 parathas...the only thing I missed here is options for starters...I really wish the management thinks of adding few more options to the starters..."
1.0,"First and last visit to this place. Saw all the great reviews and visited this place. The place was packed and I was happy expecting to have some amazing food. Waited about 10 minutes and then was given a table. Started off with a masala papad and Punjabi Kalmi sticks. The masala papad was decent but the kalmi sticks were a disaster. Disliked it completely. Then ordered a palak paneer and kulcha. It looked to me like the palak paneer was laced with lot of artificial color as the paneer had also turned green on the outside. The taste was also nothing noteworthy. The kulcha was pretty ordinary. Still hoping for something better we made the next mistake of ordering a gobi parantha each. Again it was totally disappointing. Did not even eat half of it. Have made much better parantha at several other places. Finished it off with Lassi which was too sweet. All in all, disappointed and frustrated and the last visit here. Not a very hygenic place as well. The guys cleaned the tables and then probably served food without washing their hands."
4.5,"True Punjabi-style, north Indian dhaba-type food - LOVED it. Yes there was lots of ghee and 'makhkhan' but what's Punjabi food without that. Ordered in on a rainy evening when we had vegetarian friends over for dinner and decided to try something new - so Kapoor's cafe came up.  I called them to order a delivery but was informed that they deliver via Swiggy. Tried Swiggy - they were closed possibly because of the rain. After a couple of more calls we decided we'd just pick up the food. My hubby tells me there were people waiting to dine, even on a rainy evening, at 9:30pm! Clearly, Kapoor's have got something right :)  They were kind enough to also customize Alu-parathas for the kids (no spices). We ordered mushrooms, Dhabe-di-daal, gobhi-masala!, malai kofta and rotis.  6-happy tummies! Definitely ordering again - hopefully Swiggy will be up and running this time."
4.0,"Visited the place twice, never disappointed. Ordered the following items: Lassi : Best lassi in a long time. Love the matka style of serving. Paneer Degchi Delhiwale : There signature dish, amazing combo of sweet and spicy Dal Makhani : Good, but would be nice if the gravy is made thicker and creamier Ghee Phulka : With ghee dripping from the roti, its a must order. Kulcha : Size too small, feels more like Arabic bread Khasta/Pudina Khasta Paratha : Filling and well made Overall, the food is worth every penny and even better. However, they can do something about the heat (there are only fans) during rush hours."
4.0,"A small cozy place that serves good, homely food made with love. I have always enjoyed their Puri Aloo and Chole Batura. The Pooris are fluffy while the aloo sabzi is a medley of spices which kick starts your taste buds into action. They also serve a little sukkha Aloo Sabzi on the side, which is a slightly sour, spicy aloo to complete your meal. The Chole Batura is another favorite. The Cheese Parathas are ideal for a weekend indulgence and the amount of cheese inside along with the dollop of butter on the outside makes you fall in love with calories. :) Their Shahi paneer is also very good and their thalis are very very filling. I also enjoy their Shahi Tukda and never forget to pack one for home. Their Lassis and Chaas always leave you craving for more and this is the perfect place for the late weekend brunch."
4.5,"Visited Kapoor's cafe on Sunday evening probably around 8ish. First thing to note they have open ground parking with no lights and taking SUV's gets handy due to the bike parked in corners by the members of Gurukul Sports guys(which is adjacent to Cafe). Once we entered we had to wait for around 15 minutes with a paper token of 13 provided by the person inside yes they have a token system so go inside and ask if you are a first timer. We waited outside in the chairs provided & exactly in 15 minutes they called us. We ordered assorted pakoras(panner/onion) as starter snacks, 1 chilly khasta parantha, 1 allu onion paratha, 1 missi roti, 1 dhabe di dal(6 types of dal),2 chas and 1 lassi. Food was good and tasty if you like Punjabi style. Paratha came with one good portion of makkan, chas and lassi were worth it in matkas. Total cash burn was 480 for 2 persons.. Give a try if you just like to enjoy food at an affordable cost and if you are not particular for Air Conditioned restaurant with valet parking and a star hotel ambience..."
4.0,"What a Parantha experience!! These people make one of the best paranthas in the city. Cheese Parantha is triple layered and mouth watering from the very first look. Couldn't have more than one but having one felt like heaven. Lassi is amazing and thick. If I had to rate only for food, it would be 5/5. But the sad part is the ambience. They have to work on it a lot. I personally hated it."
4.5,"Being a vegetarian, i always love to go places where i can find Lassi ( :) ), but let me tell you here i had best lassi experience i ever had, that too in kulhad, best quality tea, fluffy parathas dipped into butter, nice staffs and best cashier (you can always have small talk with him), modest price.  Must go place."
4.0,"By far the best lassi you will get in Bangalore. Baigam ka bharta and paneer lababdar are a must eat here. Although, veg kolhapuri could have been better.  Ambiance is proper Punjabi Dhaba style."
4.5,"To be a hard core non vegeterian and repeated visit to this place is a point to make by itself that how good this place's food can be. And its value for money place. Food is very good. Aloo paratha, lassi and chhola batura are just awesome among the long list of favourites. Must visit and repeated visits can be made."
3.5,"They say dhaba's always have the best food! It's absolutely true when it comes to Kapoor's Cafe. We were here on a Wednesday for brunch. I was very impressed with how well they had kept the entrnace area with a small fencing and a garden. Inside was exactly what I expected from a dhaba!  We ordered Channa bhatura and aloo parathas. Channa bhatura was really yummy! The flavors incorporated in the channa was lip smacking!  Then came the paratha, which was served with a big chunk of butter on it. My heart was pounding just by looking at it melt on my parathas! They looked really scary! In spite of the butter, the paratha was a failure. It was hard and dry and tasted under cooked. Really put our enthusiasm down. But I guess it was just not a good day for parathas, because I read multiple good reviews of how yummy they are! I'll definitely try it again next time just to get my hands on the right one! :)  Then came the showstopper, the Lassi. Served in a tiny earthen pot, this is not the kind you sip with a straw but eat with a spoon. The flavors in it was to the point. It was brilliant!  This is an economical place and the staff here are courteous. We went around 10-1030 in the morning.. As they had just opened, there was no one else.. But by the time we were leaving, people had started coming in.  For people planning to go here, it really is a dhaba as the name suggests. Do not expect great ambience..expect good authentic Punjabi food!"
5.0,Absolutely amazing food.Their lassi is the perfect way to start a meal. The parathas are brilliant and the butter makes it even better. The service is impeccable and you never need to ask for anything twice.Will definitely be visiting again.
4.5,A nice and awsum place to visit and hangout with friends and family. Do try Paneer Paratha and French Fries Punjabi Style ...these are too awsum to taste.
3.5,"Been there with my family, I would say this is an awesome place. Disappointing was they did not had my favorite Sarson Ka Saag combo. Otherwise loved it, place is jam packed.  Paratha's are good, sometimes you may end up getting half cooked pulka's so watch out for it also service is bit slow."
4.5,"This place is little deceiving, you would never expect such a place can deliver such tasty food. I went there after being highly recommended by a friend. Everything I tried there was just yum. On Weekends it can be really really crowded so I ended up ordering for to go...  Still it took them a while. But it was worth the wait for me. Worth every penny and the wait. This is another gem I found recently. Staff are really polite, calm and warm. Seriously you have to give it to them for the way they handle the crowd!!!"
4.5,"Totally like ur favourite uncle's home. Why? Nobody in the world will load u dollops of butter , make u fluffy paranthas that only a giant can consume, deceive u with a thali that looks pretty and yet wud take two hungry girls to finish off !!! Such nominal rate for the best out f the world food !! If u know me u can pretty well guess how brave I was to finally step into a veg only place and waoooooooooooo !! What lassi man... What lassi.. And exactly the stuffed parantha I like. Mostly all other places give u such flattened parantha its like someone after stuffing probably ironed it too.. This was fluffy overloaded and so loadsa love !! I liked the crowd here too ... Fresh full of energy ..and u can't help notice how efficient that one guy manages everyone's order- jam packed, probably everyone reordering and there is this one guy who attends everybody obediently and not a single goof up of bill. Atleast while I was der. It gets houseful pretty too soon. I still have one question though..how do they manage with such low rates.. I tell you even the butter they serve with everything wud cost more . Uncle asked how the food was and he was so delighted to hear we were happy with the food . see him in the pic attached :) Heres my review, Food -4.8/5 Ambience -3.5/5 (pretty neat) Service- 3.5/5 (nothing to rave about nothing to complain ) Next time I'm coming with a big gang so I can sample more :-D"
4.0,was there yesterday for dinner. Place has good ambience similar to dhaba. We ordered some parathas and lassi. Taste was awesum. Cheese Paratha was delicious. Service is friendly. Place is always jam packed but its expected with quality of food served here.
4.0,"Oh well I'm sure all my rating goes to fast service, tasty food and ol' dhaba like feeling :-) Conveniently located on marathahalli bridge to varthur road this place is like no other on this street.  What I liked the most is the fact that you get authentic Punjabi food, you can feel it on your taste buds, and man oh man the amount of butter that gets served with paratha is scary :-D I use that word because I remember back in Btm we used to ask for extra butter with parathas but over here you would happily share ur piece of butter with ur friends :-) Didn't try much food except paneer pakoras, veg kadai, degchi dehliwale, kulcha, missi roti, phulka and lassi. Recommended menu:1.lassi is a must 2. Don't miss veg kadai, its one of the tastiest I had in blore 3. Kulcha (tawa kulcha) this  actually tastes and feels like a normal bread, never had this version of kulcha in the past :-) RESERVATIONS ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF VISITING ON A WEEKEND!  will definitely go back yo this place soon!!"
4.0,"What do you look for in a restaurant? Food. Service. Reasonable Price. Everything is power packed here. Paradise for veg people. If you love punjabi food, this is a must-go. A little warning : There's gonna be huge rush, so be prepared."
5.0,"Pure authentic punjabi food. Tried dry fruit and plan lassi.. You will say ""paji ek glass hor"" About food had dal makhni, paneer lababdar and more. Mouth watering food Waiting to hop in again for my next foodie break."
4.0,"Thanks to my flatmate Siddharth, who always amuses me with his choice of eating joints, especially on some of the Sunday afternoons when we happen to eat together. This time the surprise he uncovered was Kapoor's Cafe - definitely one of the best places to eat Punjabi food in Bangalore..  I fall short of words to describe the amazing Parathas I had today, with that floating butter and Lassi (Not to forget - In the Earthen pot) and the amazing Paneer Lababdar and Rajma..The feeling of being immensely satiated after eating so much, that puts you to sleep the moment you reach home, PRICELESS !!!  I am sure I am going to take so many of my Punjabi friends to the place, it has been the find of the day...  A must visit place for Pure Punjabi's :) :)"
4.0,"Food is really great. Very hard to find authentic north indian food in Marathahalli :P Unfortunately, this leads to too much rush, especiallly on weekends.  I have been here once and once ordered online (its on swiggy). Both times had to wait for a lot of time. Seating arrangements are not good and i would say prices are a bit high given the service/ambience But then again, i loved the food. So, overall i would give it 4/5"
3.0,Authentic dhaba feel! Courteous staff and good food.  The lassi is just amazing. *_*  The paranthas are drenched in butter. Thalis are pretty good too.
4.0,Food is really good.. Staff and owner are highly courteous and friendly. Only problem is staggering wait time..but it's compensated by lip smacking food..
4.0,"Very nice , super authentic punjabi food. The owners are super courteous to attend every table personally. Must visit specially for a pure veg."
4.5,"Paradise for those who are craving for Punjabi Food in bengaluru.. Probably one of the finest Punjabi food joint... I will not say it's a luxury fine dining, but if you enjoy parathas, rajma, chole then it's worth a visit... The lassi in kullad is icing on cake..."
4.5,"We went to this place yesterday night for dinner with family. Nice warm place with a dhaba like feel to it. We ordered the aloo pyaaz and paneer pakodas with Chaas and lassi. It was amazing. For the maincourse,  we called for various paranthas and panner and dal. The parathas were spicy and loaded with butter.(say hello to calories!) But the food was really good. The portions were good too. The staff was really cordial and the service was prompt too! Great option when you're craving ghar ka khana. Big thumbs up!"
4.0,"Only marks I would deduct are for slow service, but that's seems a bit fair given the high density of people who crowd over to enjoy this authentic north indian delight. Everything on the menu is worth having. Living away from home made a bit easier. Thanks Kapoor's !!"
2.5,Overhyped and expensive for the food and ambience.Heard so much about the place and went there on a weekend noon and yes the place was bustling with people.Finally after a very long wait got hold of places only to find quite average food and v slow service.Only good part was the lassi
5.0,"Amazing food and cordial behavior fills your heart as much as your stomach. We were searching for home made North Indian food in the vicinity and we finally found it.Kali daal, fulka, parathas with home made white butter and lassi are a must try! Will visit this place again."
2.0,"So after hearing lot of positive reviews and being a punjabi I had to try this. Given the distance I decided to order food through swiggy and I was utterly disappointed when the food arrived.  I had ordered puri sabji along with the paneer pakora. Paneer pakora was like a swollen tumor, too much masala stuffing and dint taste good and puri sabji was just average.  Packaging was pathetic, they packed the puris and pakoras in a brown paper bag which must have given up as soon as it was out in given the high oil content. I think they should have the basic common sense on how to pack food. Given this disaster I dint expect that they would have kept a tissue paper or a spoon.   Feels like the place is overrated, or it was an off day for them but anyway I am gonna stay away."
2.0,"Been there late at night, it was so crowded. We managed to find place and ordered food. Waiter or some guy that looked like owners son or something told 15-20 mins and food will be served. We waited for 30 mins then asked again about order and he said 2 mins, again we waited for 10 mins. We walked off because we didnt had time to wait. One advise dont take in people if u can't provide food, else provide reasonably accurate time. No one waits for food for 45 mins that too when we have ordered pretty basic stuff."
5.0,"We had the pleasure of experiencing the royal hospitality last Saturday evening. The service is impeccable and the warm smile of the caf owner(Arpit) while welcoming you and serving, makes the day. The experience was exquisite and the richness is not only in the place but also in the food served. So if someone asks you for the best Punjabi style food in the city, undoubtedly its Kapoor's cafe. I totally loved it and will visit it again and again."
2.5,"This was my second visit today. Staff of this place is courteous. But I guess main purpose of going to any eatery is food. Taste of the food is average..and I am saying this because being a north Indian , I am aware of the taste of North Indian food. Desserts are good ...A must try is fruit cream. Worst thing about this place is they don't take card though food is not cheap here. Also cleanliness is the issue...mosquitoes can trouble u even in day time."
4.0,"True punjabi food, and clearly justifies it's name. We had parathas, baigan bharta and punjabi dal. Parathas were absolutely delicious, quite big, and had generous stuffing. Baigan bharta had that smokey flavor which made it stand out. Overall: Ambience: 3/5 Food: 5/5 Hospitality: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5"
4.5,"First of all thanks to CHEF BBwho took me this place for eating some amazing Punjabi food.  If you really want authentic Punjabi food then this place is very good for you.I got a chance to test food of this place on their first anniversary.  At first they give us Dry Fruit Lassie with desi style(i.e in kulad) which is really awesome.  Then we ordered parathas(their specialty, which was really special), Dabba ki dal(felt like delicious home made dal), Mushroom masala(good with paratha), panner butter masala(very delicious).All the items are very good in taste and quality also.  One specialty thing of Kapoor's cafe is that their entire family is in the restaurant to serve food.They don't give you felt like you are eating in a restaurant.They behave u like a one family member.  If you are staying in Marathahalli or Whitefield location then definitely go to this place for taste some Punjabi stuffs.  Eat healthy live wellBorn Foodie"
4.5,"I had the besttttt paneer paratha of my lifetime here in Kapoor's Cafe!! We just walked in to have authentic punjabi food...and I must say I didn't regret coming here at all. I actually haven't had this good authentic vegetarian punjabi food in Bangalore! This place is a must must visit for good food lovers. Ambiance - nice, mostly young crowd present Staff - 5 stars to them! they always had a sweet smile on their faces Food - simply delicious, specially parathas. Their shaahi tukda is also very famous. Price - value for money!! Will definitely visit the place again to try out some more delicacies.  Cheers to the entire team!"
4.5,Visited the place with my colleagues. The best Veg Restaurant in Bangalore. Here the specialty is Paratha and Dry Fruit Lassi. Yummy Lassi and Paratha's you will find here. And the taste of vegetables dishes are yummy.  Best place for Vegetarian.
4.5,"This place is proper Dhaba style serves very good authentic punjabi food in reasonable price with awesome service. When they saw we have an infant along with my grandmother, they gave us preference over others without our request and ensured that we get food on priority. Baingan bharta, khasta roti and fruit cream are must try."
4.5,Visited this place with colleagues after hearing a lot of good reviews about it.Whatever is on the menu is just awesome starting from Parathas to Lassi!!..Kali daal was just to die for.  A pocket friendly place :) Hospitality of the staff and owner a very big plus..a worth visiting place.
2.0,"Most over rated restaurant. They charge much higher when compared to food quality. I had paneer butter masala combo thali there for rs.160. Paneer was so spicy that all the time we had to drink water only. On the name of rice they had given 2 teaspoon of rice. But , lassi was superb there."
4.5,"Visited this place on a Thursday evening, primarily because we knew that getting a table on weekends is an extremely difficult feat to achieve. I am a hardcore punjabi and trust me this place does not disappoint 1 bit as far as being true to punjabi tastes is concerned. The place is not huge but has amazing ambience as you get to hear punjabi songs in the background (rare thing to experience in bangalore). We ordered paneer pakodas and sweet lassi to start with. The paneer pakodas were freshly prepared and were super tasty and the sweet lassi was served in a kulhad (just if you are wondering, kulhad is a small earthen pot in which desserts are served to keep them chilled). For main course, we all ordered gobi paranthas and we were more than glad to see that it was smothered by butter. To finish it off, we ordered chaas, better known as buttermilk in bangalore which could have been a bit better, still no complaints. It is a bit expensive but still worth it if u r looking for a true punjabi food experience   Food : 5/5 Ambience : 5/5 Service : 5/5 Value for money : 4/5"
4.5,"A dhaba like ambience, great parathaas. We had aalu pyaaz parathaas and lassi.The parathas were simply amazing. Typical punjabi taste with a chunk of butter melting over them. Went there by car and didn't have the problem of parking as they have a reasonable space for parking as well. Overall a nice experience"
4.5,"This place is heaven for paratha, lassi lovers.  You get amazing parathas with lots of butter on it. You would enjoy the complete experience of having a pure veg Punjabi food at this place.  Be it for breakfast,lunch, dinner everything they serve is totally amazing.  I have tried their puri-sabji, alu onion paratha, lassi, tea, kachori sabji, paneer pakoda and till date i have always returned satisfied with the food, taste, courtesy of the staff and the owners.  Today I happen to barge in there returning from a movie and the place was all decorated & Punjabi songs were playing. They completed their 1year of service and as a small gesture they were giving 10% discount to all customers.  This really felt amazing !  Food is just not about eating quantity, it is about quality and peace it brings to you ! This is the place which I bang on for this ....  Cheers to Kapoor's cafe !"
2.0,"We went for dinner on Sunday at 8:15. We had to wait for 1.5 hours to get a table. I was excited as I had suggested this place to all my friends. But it turned out to be disaster since it started with long wait and then the food which was exactly opposite as got in reviews here.   Food - Food was extra heavy in the sense that the rotis were dipped into butter. Aloo pyaz pakoda were too oily. As all of the food was made into extreme hurry because of people waiting and moreover these people were serving the waiting Swiggy guys on first priority which enhanced the wait and increased the mess and massively might have reduced the quality. Kalmi Punjabi Sticks were good though.  Ambience - Okay. It was like just another dhaba full of rush, not that clean and calm. No pre-bookings allowed. So in such case one would be surely wasting a lot of valuable time.  Service - Service I would say was okay. The manager was managing quite well in spite of having this much of crowd.  So I would suggest people to go only on weekdays if at all you may want to try out after reading other reviews(which were good) or else rush up when they are just open."
3.0,"Food here is totally punjabi. Food is good but the i was waiting for about 45 mins for the table and then 30 mins for food. Waiting area for guests is worst, it was raining and no perfect place for guest."
5.0,If u like north indian food then its a must visit place.. One of the most authentic north indian food i have had in bangalore. The usp of the place is there personal attention towards each customer. From first day it is open the taste still remains the same. Must try. U cannot afford to miss out on there deserts.
4.5,"I have visited this place with a usual quest for good food. Simplicity of this place might put a question , as there are many places that claims to serve authentic north indian food, but fails to do so.But this place is surely different, one is the best place to taste real punjabi food.Food is mouth watering, behaviour and zeal to serve quality is very nice. I would definitely recommend this place. Parathas are must try."
4.0,"Good food, nice behaviour authentic North Indian veg restaurant, I loved it.  I along with two of my veggie friend went to the restaurant to have some paratha.  We ordered aloo paratha onion paratha raita masala papad.  Paratha were served hot with lot of butter on it. It was yummy and I felt like I am eating paratha in Delhi. It was authentic North Indian paratha with good stuffing and lot of butter on it. The green chautney was like icing on the cake. The masala papad was awesome heavy onion tomato topping made it spacial. Raita was good but price was on a higher side.   The sardarji was very nice well behaved and the hospitality was superb. If you are staying near to the place you must try this place.  On pricing : it could be better, I feel it is slightly on a higher side but it worth it.  All veggies must try this outlet   Ambiance : 4/5 Food : 5/5 Cleanliness : 5/5 Price: 3.5/5 Behaviour : 5/5"
5.0,"I love this place and visit often and I must say it is a sure sure place to dine.They serve a variety of veg dish, curry is very rich and creamy,out of all my favourite butter paneer and Daal tadka and a yummy sweet Lassie compliments the meal perfectly.This place is very crowded on weekends but I must say the owner himself makes sure that everybody is accommodated with minimal waiting time.  Paneer pakoda deserves a special mention :)"
4.5,"It took nearly 1 hr for me to reach to the place as it was far from my home. Suggested by friends, decided to be there. It was raining heavily and still this place was full. Being a first timer, I was in dillemma about the quality of the food. But after the first bite, I had to admit that the place was worth the travel. The behavior of owner (Kapoor Uncle) was exceptional and I felt amazed even after a small conversation. Overall, I had a wonderful evening and a great  experience."
4.0,"Another Punjabi outlet among many near whitefield area. But this one stands apart among many near by restaurants. Located very near to Kundanahalli gate bus stop where you can take a walk on varthur road about 200mts and there you can see a big Gurukal sports Academy and on the left side with colorful small building is the Kapoors cafe. The staff is very nice who knows how to handle the customers very well. Weekends will be rush but during normal days you can grab a seat easily. Punjabi foods  always taste good for any kind of foodie. Parathas are extremely stuffed with rich in paneer, Gobi, pyaazz etc. Big chunk of butter always floats on the parathas. Pickles and green chutney with curd always served along with the parathas. Subzis are manageable with not as expected quantity. You can have starter one or two like pakoda which tastes good. But paratha meal is the must. Don't forget to ask a flavoured lassi served in mud pot. Make a place for always Cool and delicious lassi at the end.  Ambience wise better compared to other nearby restaurants. I think the price is slightly high . Not for very pocket friendly kind of restaurants but once in a while is worth visiting."
3.5,Been here for friends send off dinner party... Starters and lassi were good... Dissapointed with main course... Need to improve the taste...
4.0,"One of the best places for your out of the blue Punjabi food craving. Fantastic food, quick service and courteous staff. An eye for structure and hygiene would make it a perfect place for hungry bellies."
4.0,Great food. Decent ambience. Reasonable price. Be sure to try the Lassi -both the plain and dry fruit one!  They are an absolute delight! Food cooked well and tastes good! Try this out for some good north Indian food!
4.0,"A great place to visit. The taste is awesome. Had been to this place with friends. Had paneer pakoda, paratha, and puri chole. The place is bit crowded, so just adjust time."
4.0,"This place is located to the other part of the city from my stay. Friend suggested to give a try once. Been to this place with my friends for lunch.. Although at first, it didn't look appealing, but once I savoured the dish, the feeling was different. The place is always crowded."
4.5,"Sheer simplicity of the place might abruptly put a question in your mind.. ""Can this place offer me the Punjabi food or is it just a bogus like others?"" Trust me guys, I have visited Punjabi homes and this place is just as warm welcoming as the houses i have been to. It is just that you order for food and be rest assured to go out with a happy stomach"
4.5,"Went there for a team lunch. Mouthwatering food! Pocket friendly too! Highly recommend the lassi (also the dry fruit lassi - yummmmmm), aloo paratha, cheese paratha and spicy French fries. Not for the waistline conscious, but delicious food. Also loved the service. Very polite, patient ( we were a noisy bunch) and helpful. This review is making me hungry! Off to Kapoors cafe!"
4.5,"We decided to come here after reading rave reviews on Zomato and Facebook, and were not disappointed to say the least. The place was bustling with people and had a positive vibe about it. The food we ordered was delicious (Parathas,Lassi,Masala Papad,Shahi Tukda). Icing on the cake was behaviour of staff and owners, the man had a smile on his face all through. Way to go guys!!!"
4.0,Visited this place on a Sunday eve. It was very crowdy. It took nearly 40 mins to get a table but after having the first bite I realised those 40 mins were worth the wait. The owner of the restaurant was really polite and they have managed the place in a very cost efficient way.  I like the menu presentation.  The Buttermilk and Dry Fruit Lassi were served in desi style( in kulhad) and were really good.  I ordered Paneer Do Pyaza and Dal Makhani with Chilly Onion Khasta Parantha. The food was mouth-watering. Proper dhabewala feel. The service was really quick.  A place Light on Pocket and Heavy on Stomach. Worth visiting again n again.  Most appropriate restaurant to satisfy your quench for desi food in vicinity.
4.0,Already heard a lot about this place and had a chance to visit.  Cheese paratha : you can expect it to be stuffed with cheese and topped with makkhan Paneer pakoda was average. Not much flavors to it.  Shahi paneer was pretty good with the fulkas and the boondi raita. Finished it off with jeera rice and dal makhni.  Must try : dry fruit lassi  Looking forward for the next visit to try other things.  Edit :  Visited again :D  Bliss....
3.5,We go there whenever we goto Gurukul to play. It is a reasonably affordable place with very good service. The family owns this restrau for a year now and both the brothers are very humble. I like their dal makhni and all items of paneer. Lassi is a must try
5.0,"What a great find this has been. Had it bookmarked for a while and finally got the chance to visit it.  Ambiance - It is a small Dhaba like setup, but very hygienic and clean. The best part is the music, they played some really classic punjabi songs. With such feet tapping music, for a moment I felt like I was in Punjab.  Food - I never tasted such authentic and tasty North Indian food anywhere in the whole bangalore. The food is just mouth watering and make you feel like eating it even when you are full. We ordered Kalmi punjabi sticks (would be a good tea time snack), Paneer degchi delhiwale (their specialty, which was really special), rajma (felt like delicious home made rajmas) and Kheer (served in pot and absolutely delicious).   Service - Restaurant is maintained by a family with Father taking care of the billing and sons take care of the orders. Everyone was very courteous and friendly and the service was also very quick.  Absolutely recommended if you want to have authentic tasting north Indian food. Will be visiting it again and again and again."
4.0,"Amazing place to have veg food. Kapoors are bringing taste of north india to bangalore. Those aalo, gobhi and onion parathas with all that butter on the top are mouth watering. The taste and quantity of dal and paneer dishes makes me wanna have more and more.   If you wanna have authentic north indian veg food prepared by a proper punjabi family with punjabi hospitality, this is the place to be.... burrrrrahhh...."
4.0,"Have been to this place twice in last 5 days... And that says it all... First time we ordered Dhabe ki dal and Spcl Paneer.. The quantity was amazing and so was the taste. We had khasta paratha and normal paratha too... Both were quite soft. The fried green chillies that they serve alongside the meal are also yummy. Lassi was tasty but I wish the quantity was more... It was more like having sweet curd.  The second time we tried dal makhni with regular paratha and onion paratha. Dal was delicious... Makhan in the dal was well balanced and its flavor wasn't too overpowering. The onion paratha was loaded with butter and was yum. The mugular paratha wasn't as soft as the first time.. But was tasty nonetheless.  All in all, had a very fulfilling meal each time. Will visit again soon!"
4.5,"This place was bookmarked for close to an year, but since Whitefield is reasonably far from my place, didnt get a chance to visit.  On a trip to Phoenix MarketCity, this came back on radar and since it was on the way back, it made sense to pay a visit here.  It was around 8pm on a Sunday when we reached. Place was jam packed, tons of people waiting, our number was 13, currently 7 was seated.  In another 10-15 mins we got the table as service is quite fast.  Place is managed by a Punjabi family. Father manages the cash counter.  One son manages the kitchen, another manages the floor (taking orders and also informing his father who has ordered what to add to the bill).  What we ordered -  1 Mix Veg Paratha 1 Khasta Paratha 1 Daal Makhni 1 Malai Kofta 1 Curd 1 Chaas  Total bill came around Rs. 800 or so.  This place is one of the best for North-Indian I had in Bangalore. It reminded me of my Amritsar-Chandigarh trip. Parathas are king size and finishing one is also a task.  Unfortunately kulchas had run out. we had gone specifically for this. Next time hopefully.  What works - 1. The food. 2. The father and the son managing the floor are very friendly considering the hordes of people waiting and seated. Usually when the places are doing very well a certain level of arrogance sets in. Not here. 3. Prices are ok, Dishes are priced around 200 rs. Though they also have combos which are more VFM and in demand.  What should improved - 1. The service - took a good 15-20 mins to get the order. 2. As crowd increased, people had surrounded all over (waiting) is which didn't make a good experience. We had tough time even asking for anything as we couldnt see the waiters or they couldnt see us or simply because there was a wall of people around us.  Thing to note - 4 wheeler parking can be a problem as not much of space inside. Outside parking not sure whether its there or even advisable, as the entrance is from the main road only.  Type of crowd - mostly students/bachelors, few families and couples.  Go with an empty stomach and eat away the rich food. Lunch on a holiday is advisable to enjoy siesta after this! :-)"
4.5,"Amazing food... classic place for food... must try place in this locatity..come after 9pm,u ll get good crowd..You must have lassi in your bill"
4.0,"When you served a generous dollop of butter on your parantha, how can you possibly go wrong?:) Amazing paranthas! Affordable pricing. Friendly service.  Try their 4 cheese / 6 cheese parathas.... Delicious melting cheese, onions, tomatoes wedged between two thin layers of paratha with a fistful of desi ghee on top.....drooool! You can thank me later;)  However, service can be faster....it took 20 min for our order to arrive:P"
4.0,"It is fine even if bad restaurant is not reviewed but a good one needs to be reviewed ..a honest foodie!  I have been thinking of going to this place from quite some after reading the reviews.It might be too early to come conclusion on their cuisine but here is my first impression.  This place is very well decorated and ambience is pleasant enough for quick meal.It is a typical dhaba with a bit of trendy looks.The staff was courteous,helpful and very pleasant.At the end of meal you would just feel that you are in relatives house :) (in a good way ).we order a couple of special dishes in the restaurant.The food served was hot and there was absolutely no delay in delivering the food.The panner tasted good,parathas were excellent,lassi was tasty on a overall it was very good experience.I will try more items and will update the review.  Must try --------- Panner gravy Parathas  What didn't tasted good ----------------------- Boondi raitha-The boondi was not crispy ,it was pre made.   Pricing:5/5  Quantity:4/5 Taste:4/5 Ambiance:3.5/5 Crew:5/5  Bottom line:A must try if you are a veggie and loves punjabi food."
3.0,"Hospitality - good Prices - good  Food - ... Not so impressed.  Why?  Let me elaborate.  I've lived in Lucknow for the major part of my life, I am quite familiar with North cuisine. From the greats to the streets.  So the Lassi, which may impress many, was EXACTLY like the curd I got at one of the famous local chat stalls. Not say to it isn't good. It was my favorite at home! But that left me underwhelmed here.  I'm not a fan of parathas in general, but still, I have had better than that triple cheese.  Punjabi fries were good! But so are peri peri from McD.   I'm not criticizing. Just saying, the hype was SO HUGE for this place. My expectations sky rocketed. Like the food will be extraordinary.   Still a decent place. N really good if u want a casual meal for less bucks.  Will return to try other stuff but my expectations of 5/5 got reduced.  Maybe those who haven't experienced this kind of food living in the north, they may be blown away. Might change my rating after trying more things"
4.5,A real welcome change from the usual line up of restaurants in the Whitefield area. This little cafe offers some lip smacking Punjabi food. Do try paneer lababdar with some crisp roti and end the meal with dry fruit lassi. Good food couple that with value for money will leave you coming back for more.
1.0,"I don't know how this place got 4 rating.. Food is pathetic , don't judge me.. I've been to this place twice and both the time food was really bad.. Question is why?... Well first, they use tons of oil in curry's , secondly quantity and quality was not par with prices.. P.s: My order was : Your Swiggy order #1040695735 has been delivered."
4.0,"Unexpectedly landed here with a few friends and wow! The name got me thinking how the place and food would be. Kapoor's cafe is a cute place with amazing punjabi cuisine. The lassi is served in the traditional kulad and it is thick and yummy (just do not have it before the main course, fills you up a lot). The khasta paratha, baingan ka bharta and rajma is authentic and mouth watering. Service was pretty quick and overall a nice experience."
3.0,"Its a bit classy place with just enough space to serve your taste buds. I had heard about this place a lot of time for their authentic Punjabi veg items, so Decided to give a try.  The food was above average, and ambiance and other aspects are just ok. Though it gathers a lot of crowd everyday, but I found this place too hyped. Apart from rajma chawal, I didn't like anything especially lassi, which was too sour.  Its a place to go just once."
5.0,"Delicious food, fast service and punjabi songs, just like a place in Delhi. Finally a place where you get awesome and tasty-est North Indian food in affordable price. Service was fast and the food was hot and had nice ghee smell. Just waiting for the season to come and will surely try sarson ka saag and Makke di roti.  Must Try- Kheer (never had better in bangalore) and Khasta paratha (same as you get in Delhi) Try Combos, enough for 2 people. Definitely recommend. Will surely be going again. Go n njoy the taste of North.."
4.0,"Located in the same area as that of Gurukul, Kapoor's cafe is what anyone would call as a perfect Punjabi dhaba. We has seen this cafe everytime we go to play badminton, but one day since we had some time we decided to try this place. The ambiance is rustic and would remind anyone of a dhabha on the highway. The staff is friendly and cheerful. Some of the owners themselves are the waiters and they are more than happy to cater to the customers. Their menu is quirky and funny and has quite a lot of items.  We asked for aloo parathas and chaas. The chaas was perfectly spiced and very refreshing. The parathas was served with an interesting chutney made out of radish, chilly and garlic. The stuffing on the parathas was generous and delicious and the dollop of butter added to it made all the difference to its taste. One of the best parathas that I have had in Bangalore so far.  Do visit if you are craving for some authentic Punjabi food and are low on the budget.  Staff and Service: 4/5  Ambiance: 3.5/5  Taste: 4/5  Value for money: 4/5  Price for two: Rs 300 approx."
1.0,"Very Poor Quality Food with High Price. They are basically Cheaters, I ordered 20 Phulka,3 plate Shai Tukara and 2 Raita, Costs me 710. They parceled only 6 pc Shai Tukara instead 12. Phulka's of Worst quality. Spoiled Raita. Very unhealthy and unhygienic food. By seeing good rating excited me to order from these Cheaters and Will never ever visit them. Please check the hygiene, It is not at all good."
4.5,"Sunday lunch at this place. Although it appeared very crowded, it didn't take long to be allowed with a table for 5. The staff are quite attentive. Service is reasonably quick for a busy Sunday noon. The food, I give a 5/5. We had the aloo parantha which was exceptional with a load of butter to give the true Punjabi feel. The baigan bharta was exceptional with the tinge of d charcoal- cooked odour.. The rotis were soft. The kadai paneer had the right amount of spices and tender paneer pieces. The lassi again gets 5/5 and out beats all the lassi places I tried in Bangalore. Ambience was reasonable. Value for money gets 4.5/5 I can say! All in all I recommend this place to people on that side of the city and would love to visit often!"
4.5,A pocket friendly restaurant with good service and good food. Don't miss the lassi :) I have been here twice with my friends and every time its the same good feeling.
4.0,Went to this place for Sunday morning breakfast with Pakoras in my mind. First thing that I liked about this place is it's setup. This place feels like some dhaba on a highway. They've lots of coolers in place which keeps the place cool. I ordered Aalo Pyaz pakora and Paneer pakora. I wasn't completely satisfied with them. Aalo Pyaz pakora were quite oily. But quantity was soo good that I couldn't try any other thing this time. I saw lots of other things being served to people around me for which I'll surely visit this place again to try them one by one.
4.0,"If you want to have a nice simple punjabi meal this place is a must try.. Punjabi style fries( different but realllly amazing) , paneer bread pakora, butter milk, aloo dhaniya raita are few items which I can vouch for..it brings in a touch of homely food.. Nice ambience with really good service... If you are low on cash you can visit this place and have a really yummy meal. :)"
3.5,"Nice cafe,  after entering in you get a North Indian dhaba feel.  The staff is very friendly and the food quantity is good.  Pretty reasonable and home like food."
4.0,Authentic punjabi vegetarian food. The best place around marathalli.   one thing goes in cons is the waiting time there.otherwise the food is good.                                                                 mrinaljain.com
5.0,"You name 'Authentic Punjabi veg food' and this place just serves it right infront of you. Defines authenticity to its utmost limit. Being a non-vegetarian myself, I was quite hesitant in going to this place in the beginning but if I wouldn't have gone, I surely would have regretted. Ambience: It has a typical dhaba-ish atmosphere with lots of chirpy people around enjoying their food. Had to wait for about half an hour to get a seat coz people just keeping pouring in. Food: One word DELICIOUS...Starting from the aloo parathas...to the dal makhani...pulao rice..mushroom curry and paneer masala... A person like me who generally has 4-5 parathas easily was finding it difficult to even finish 2....such were their sizes and the stuffing. And the main catch was the DRY FRUIT LASSI. Shall leave a tinge in your tongue even after ur done with your food.. Excellent place to have a vegetarian lunch or dinner if you are in or around Whitefield... And most importantly, the waiters were very courteous.. :)"
4.5,"One of the best places to eat veg food in Bangalore. It's a small place near kundalahalli gate, and the food is simply amazing.  We had some butter milk for the start and some French fries which was completely different from the normal kind you get. For the main course, we had phulkas with paneer do pyaaz and jeera rice with rajma. It was delicious. In the end we had some lassi which was awesome.  The ambience is nice, gives a very North Indian feel to the place. It's clean and the best part is the service. They are quick and helpful. Although the food is full of butter and oil, it's ok to spoil yourself once in a while. I will definitely recommend you guys to try it out."
4.5,Complete VFM and lip smacking punjabi food this part of town! Crowded but service is prompt and patrons well attended. The food is RRRIIICH but I did not mind that :).
4.0,lovely Outlet!  tasty food a lot of waiting hAppens after 8pm..  but a perfect desi tadka to your half-videsi-half-indian soul Chaaaaas lovers ko jannat!   carry a mosquito bat when you plan to wait outside the restaurant!   Nothing else..  Just go and eat
4.0,Good north Indian punjabi food. A must go place atleast once. The fruit cream is amazingly good. Its a bit harsh on the pocket though.A Must go for a weekend lunch.
5.0,"Food is delicious. Hospitality is unmatched. Kudos to Kapoor uncle and saade dono praas. Keep it up guys. Best thing about it is being PURE-VEG in an alien land. Aaloo, aaloo pyaaz and gobhi parathas are best amongst stuffed parathas. Lassi is awesome."
5.0,"Food is just toooo good. Pocket friendly restaurant.  Do try their Lassi, its yummm...overall good service. Ambience is not thaat great but it doesn't matter if the service n food is good and if u r wit frnds. They have a huge parking area (+point in Blr)"
4.0,"mouth watering finger licking god made punjabi food with lotzz of butter and ghee spread on the food.....d sentence says it all....tis amazing food joint is located in the campus of Gurukul academy......I have been goin derr to play badminton after office hours but never thght great bout dis place .....only after seeing the reviews in zomato i visited for a morning brunch on one saturaday with my roomies.....and as always the people's verdict in zomato wins again ...we had lassi chass along with alu poori, alu pyaaz paratha, mix paratha, matar kulcha and chole bhature.......the lassi in the kulhad was a delight but the quantity is less as compared to other outlets...it was undoubtedly the best breakfast i had in recent times...the ambience is quite dull but the food wins your heart ...and the best part was they will pour the butter in ur plates with open heart .....a real taste of punjab in the streets of bangalore....must recommended for anyone who likes north indian vegetarian food.Minus 1.0 for the interiors...they can improve upon dat                                             fudvoyage.wordpress.com"
3.5,"A small innovatively decorated place near Kundanhalli gate which serves amazing Punjabi food. You can drop by here for a simple thali or hot hot parathas or just a glass of lassi. Everything you order will be rich and tasty, with a big chunk of butter or makkhan on top. My personal favourite is their Sarso da saaj and Makke di roti, but they only serve that in the winter months. Lassi is always a part of my order and I simply love the way they serve in those small earthen pots. This is the place if you are looking for authentic Punjabi food in the area."
4.5,"Lovely food, lovely service! The parathas are exquisite and entices the taste buds to the core. The combos are also very delectable. I wouldn't say the price is too high or too low but worth going several times to have those oozing makhan parathas and heavenly lassis in clay pots. Bon appetite!"
4.5,"north indians, tasty food, nice ambiance, sexy feel!"
5.0,For all the parantha lovers it is a heaven. The lassi is just amazing. The service is superb. This places deserves 5. The food is worth the price.
4.0,"This is one such place, that had a modest start, but picked up banking solely on their quality. A small place, almost makeshift, near Kundanhalli gate, that serves lip-smacking parathas. The Punjabi flavour is authentic and the food is very rich. Do not go here looking for salads. Taste is the priority here. The service is slow, but friendly. The owner is a smiling plump guy who asks genuinely, ""Beta, khana theekh tha?"" So much warmth! Do try lassi here. It is served in earthen 'kullhad' and is very tasty!"
4.5,"Amazing place for parantha lovers. I visited this place for a brunch with my friends. We ordered Cheese parantha, chole bhature , bread paneer pakora lassi and buttermilk. Enjoyed every bit of my meal. Cheese parantha just melts in your mouth and is their must have. Loved it.. will definitely visit again!!! :)"
4.5,Visited Kapoor's Cafe on a ltd afternoon for a short eat. Ordered Masala Papad and Lassi which were not only tasty but also refreshing. The servers were very friendly and had a constant smile on their face that made the place homely. Perfect for all the hungry and tired players who step out of Gurukul sports academy.
3.5,"Visited this place with my team for an Team Lunch. Anyone can miss this restaurant very easily as the restaurant has been tucked into a short passage from the main road.  The place is very simple, if people are expecting a grand ambiance will get disappointed. But the food which are served are good and tasty since they use the spices and others prepared in their house itself.  The cost is reasonable for the quality food that they serve and the people who serve are very friendly."
5.0,Heaven for Parantha lovers!! Really Nice ambience..Reminded me of our very own Punjab :) If you are visiting on weekend consider buffer time because you will probably have to wait for a while..but it's really worth it !
4.0,"If you want to meet as many North Indian people at a single place this is the place!   The place looks quite simple. But you wouldn't believe your eyes when you go on Sat/Sun evening. There will be hordes of people waiting to get a table. We went at around 10pm and got a table only at 10:45pm. Such is the crowd there. And then you wonder what's the fuss all about.   Food is proper North Indian veg food, mainly Punjabi. Dal makhni and their paneer items are a must try. And lassi.   You will enjoy not only the food but the ambience as well. Most people are youngsters working around Whitefield in IT firms.   A fantastic place for food. Heard their breakfast items are also good. Will pay a visit"
3.0,"Well the food is very much like home made food, fresh and tasty. However seeing people going gaga over the taste is a bit of a disappointment. This is not a special place, if you are able to eat good homemade food on weekdays then you won't enjoy the weekend here. The ambience is very basic and seating little bit on uncomfortable side, pricing is very average and I would say I have eaten cheaper and better than this in Bangalore. Feels like this place is popular just because there is lack of good north indian restaurants in and around Marathahalli.  We ordered onion paratha and gobi paratha along with dal makhani and lassi, as aloo paratha was not available. Dal makhani was very average and not at all thick the way it is in Up North. Onion paratha was better than the two however I did not like gobi paratha at all. Lassi was awesome and was the only saving grace. Service is good, however that comes only secondary to food. I will think twice before going in again."
4.0,"Great food , well priced . You can trust the menu card and can order anything .avoid going during weekday at lunch time . Waiting period is high."
4.5,"Best north Indian restaurant I have ever been to. Decent ambience, lovely food, good price. Serving wont take long. If you love butter with your food, then this is the restaurant for u. Never miss the Lassi."
4.0,"Simply superb. Its really hard to find a good north Indian restaurants in white field. But Kapoors cafe is nice Panjabi dhaba style restaurant with decent food, staff & ambience. And most important thing it is budgeted as well."
4.5,"Best north indian food in Bangalore.  I have been here with many of my friends and colleagues. This place is awsome and the food is super awsome.   I have tried many dishes and all were delicious.  like Baigan bharta, Chole, Matar Paneer, Paneer ButterMasala, Paneer do pyaza, paneer bhurji, Shahi paneer, etc..etc...  I would suggest not just read the review but come here..the food is worth a try..."
4.5,"I have been to this place many times. Firstly because it is very near to my home. Secondly because they offer fresh food that tastes like home made food :) I have tried a lot of food items here. Palak paneer is my personal favourite. It's a must try. The gravy is smooth and there are so many paneercubes in it that you can have one in every bite! Desi ghee fulkas are too good. And yes of course they offer delicious chaas! I always have atleast 2-3 of it everytime I go there. There is just one thing that I don't like about the food is that they add a little too much of garam masala in their dry veggies. Although all the gravy dishes will make u want have them more and more. Do visit Kapoor's cafe for their yummy stuffed parathas, paneer dishes,chaas and fulkas!"
4.5,Great place for Punjabi and north Indian food.Has a really dhaba like ambience and food. The paranthas are very good and really authentic punjabi paranthas with a lot of butter added on top ( which can be removed if you want ). The staff is really nice and the owners sit at the shop and personally look at the service.  in all its a wonderful place for nice vegetarian punjabi food with great ambience and service. Would definitely visit again.  Food 4/5 Service 5/5 Ambience 4/5
4.0,"Having lived in Punjab for a few years, I had developed the taste for thick lassi which is sweet to the right level. After trying lassi at some places in bangalore I had given up the search for the perfect lassi until i had it here. Infact, not just the lassi, whatever item we ordered was exactly like that you would find in Punjab. Be it the big fat aloo ka paratha with butter on top or the perfect Rajma chawal, everything was top notch. Once i had a thali there. Boasting a big appetite, I found the quantity to be perfect. The ambience is average but definitely the most authentic North Indian food around."
1.0,"Worst food ever. Not at all recommended. Not at all Punjabi. The dishes served lack in both - taste and preparation. I went here seeing the Zomato rating. I had ordered Shahi Paneer, Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta. There was nothing Shahi about Shahi Paneer. There was one and only one ingredient in it. SUGAR!!! loads and loads of it. Also Malai Kofta tasted more like Gulab Jamun. Crazy restaurant. I think they wanted to kill us with Diabetes. Lassi was again sweet + curd. It lacked the original meaning of Lassi. Highly disappointed!"
4.5,Generously stuffed Parathas and spicy starters topped off with lassi!!. Great place for Punjabi and north Indian food. Reminds me of hotels in Mumbai. Hotel has a nice ambiance with Punjabi/hindi music playing in the background. Quality and taste of food is excellent. car parking is available. I eat here quite often and breeder get bored of the taste
4.5,"If you are a true Northie you should try this place out, authentic north indian taste with hint of homemade food. But go in weekdays otherwise just to get a table you'll need to wait for atleast 30-35 minutes."
5.0,"Very Delicious and Mouth watering Punjabi food. Rotis are very soft and Having Lassi here is must. Staff people are very friendly. Ambience of the place is like Dabha, So don't expect it to be quite classy."
3.5,"This place is in the the gurukul sports complex and that is the only way you will be able to find this place. It is a small shack with a temporary setup. But the food served is wayy better than what you might think when you enter this place.  This place was jam packed on a weekday afternoon and rightly so. The lassi and the butter milk was served on a claypot cup and was absolutely delicious. Only the buttermilk served in Rajdhani matches the quality of the butter milk served here. For 30/- bucks? It is definitely worth the price. The panner lababdar and dal tadka was decent too, the paneer was really soft and the masala i felt was a bit sweet, when we were told it will be spicy. The dal felt soggy, but the flavouring was definitely there. No tandoor, so we ordered plain rotis. Couple of them got really chewy and hard by the time we got around to eat it, but we had no choice since the quantity of butter they serve with parathas is crazzy. Service is slow, so order how much ever you want at once; waiting for rotis with sabzi on your plate is pissing off.  300 bucks for a simple lunch? Maybe once in a while, but i don't see myself coming here often. P.S. Excuse the empty plate, but the food was really delicious."
5.0,"This is it. The search for authentic Punjabi food ends here. From Parathas topped with dollop of butter to ghee fulkas, from awesome creamy lassi to shahi tukda and kheer, its really Finger Lickin Good. Literally every things tastes so good that one can keep licking the bowls. Service is quick given the kind of crowd they see on weekends. Definitely a must visit and definitely a must repeat visit."
4.0,"I know Whitefield has less option for food than various place in Bangalore. This is one of the good places in Whitefield, which is nice and cheap at the same time. Located in front of Gurukul on Varthur Road.   The place is always crowded, we were there on Saturday evening, a guy gave us a token to wait and clearly mentioned it will take 30 minutes, but we had to wait for 45 minutes. Indeed, a popular place.  It was worth waiting. We had a great cheese paratha, which had a load of cheese stuffed into it. Mix paratha was also good, nicely stuffed vegetables and a free butter with this, made it delicious. The best was Aalu pyaaz paratha, you will love it. We also ordered kadai paneer, thinking if paratha was small. But paratha was of large size. A paratha is enough for one person. Lassi was good too. Kadai Paneer was nice.  The only problem was the service, too slow. May be due to rush hour, but they should increase the area, its just like a small den with sheets as ceiling.   Price was decent but management lacked a lot. I will definitely visit this place again for good food."
3.5,A hot place in marathalli. I saw the review on zomato and decided to go to this place. It serves Authentic North Indian food. The food here is just perfect. The service here is also pretty good. A pocket friendly place. You MUST MUST have lassi here.
3.5,"Though i am a south indian, i really liked the food here.   Mushroom tikka was awesome.  Must Visit!   Value for money!  Will go and explore the punjabi food again!"
4.5,"My only visit so far to this quaint little eatery had been for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Built in a shack kind of place with a tin roof, this place doesn't offer much in terms of ambience. However, what bring people here is the food and we decided to test this claim.  We ordered chole bhature, kachori aloo, kulcha aloo and aloo Pyanz paratha. Also in beverages , lassi and chai. Everything we ordered was so tasty that we devoured those in no time. The parantha stuffing was soft and tasty, helped with a dollop of white butter on top. The lassi was one of the best I have had. Sweet, rich and yummy. We finished it off with kheer and shahi Tukda. Both the desserts were finished off in seconds. In the end it was a very satisfying breakfast and I am curious to find out how the main meals taste.  I have heard these are family recipes which is why the taste of the food is so good."
4.5,Arguably the best paratha i have EVER had. With generous portions they did not compromise on taste. Would definitely come back to explore the menu with an elevated expectation and appetite.
4.5,"Kapoor's has become a place of pilgrimage for me ever since I've moved to Whitefield. I visited it the first time because of a recommendation from some north Indian friends and was blown away! The ambiance isn't fancy at all, the place is located in a tiny shack like area but it certainly gives it a homely touch. And the owners are extremely attentive and courteous.  Coming to food, everything on their menu is top notch. Starting from lassi to parathe to desserts, I've tried it all and loved it. My personal recommendations would be lassi, cheese paratha, pudina khasta paratha, chilly onion paratha and fruit cream. They serve all parathas with a generous amount of butter. You can also ask for some extra white makhan! I also like the paneer lababdar with ghee fulke. I never tried the combos here but i'm sure i will on one of my regular visits. All in all, I love to visit this place atleast once a month like a ritual, especially because of the hospitality and the deliciousness. The price is reasonable for the taste they are offering. I would have given them a 5 if they did home deliveries and also there's a bit of scope of improvement with the paneer gravy preparations.  Sorry for not posting any pictures, once the food arrives here it is impossible to think of anything other than stuffing your mouth with the awesomeness.  Keep up the good work!"
4.5,Ossum food!  Real tasty and economical.  If you're ordering a combo.  It's good enuf for 2 ppl..cudnt finish it alone:) make sure you either make reservations or reach by 730 pm for dinner. . We waited for about 25 mins. .but worth it! !
4.5,This place is good except ambience.. This ia sort of dhaba with great lassi and paranthas with white butter...amazing place for paranthas and authentic Punjabi food...
3.5,I have been to Kapoor's cafe thrice now and it has been good so far. Paratha's are good with very good filling and good masala levels (although Panner paratha was dull-my favorite is aloo pyaaz). Best it to try it with white butter. Gravies are good. My main disappointment was Poori Cholle. Cholle were not the delhi flavour as advertised and Poori had lot of oil in it. I had to use 2-3 napkins per poori to make it edible. Lassi and Chaaz both are very good. Pakora platter is also very nice and it tastes even better in rainy season :)
4.0,The place to go in whitefield area if u wish to have good punjabi food. It's a small place and normally quite packed on weekends. I love their various paranthas.
5.0,"Today as discussed with you , we ordered for lunch through Swiggy, order number :- Order: #7759425 Complete order was messed up as it was incomplete. However we did check with Swiggy team , and they admitted that the order which we placed was a mismatch with what we got. Can you crosscheck and please make sure they are delivering the things right. Regards"
4.5,"Superb lassi.. Stuffed, hot and tasty parathe with a lot of butter on top which is how I like them.. Along with quality food, the hospitality of waiters is quite commendable. Must visit for Punjabi and North Indian food lovers though you would have to wait a bit if you go for weekend dinner."
4.0,"Good food. People there welcome you, help you select from the menu and serve with the smile. It's has different options than what you see in a Punjabi restaurant."
4.0,Two stuffed paranthas and one lassi!!! This is it... If u have this on ur table at Kapoor's then u need nothing else. Period 10 on 10 for the hospitality with which they serve...
4.5,"Very good place , nice food purely north Indian , loved the parathas, lassi and the began ka bhartha was amazing , nice small place for family and friends"
4.5,"Had lunch here today, and to be frank I wasn't expecting much - I was wrong! This is a must try place. The ambiance isn't top notch but that really doesn't matter, because the food is. Service is good, and the staff is courteous. Simple back to basics chairs and tables, nothing fancy here. Ordered a couple of fulkas, kulchas and paneer butter masala. All of them tasted good and were well prepared , the paneer butter masala had just the right balance of flavour. Monetary damage isn't bad at all. I've seen a lot of people recommend trying the lassi here, and I missed out on it. Will be back again."

4.0,"This place literally grew up in front of my eyes. Going for swimming in an adjacent sports club, I saw this place being built (around Feb-2014) and even had enquired once about the menu.  Cut to June-2015, and my-oh-my, has this place gathered a name for itself. It is now one of the top rated places in Whitefield. I decided it was definitely time to pay a visit - and so I did last Sunday. And was I surprised.  The place was teeming with diners - and we were asked to wait for a few mins. They give these quaint chits of paper with a number written on it - to let you know your turn. When our number came, we were ushered inside with instructions to the matre d'hotel that 'inlogo ko fit Kara do'  (we laughed at the choice of words) :)  Anyway, as I said - the pace was bustling with people and activity - but our order was taken quite promptly. It being a vegetarian restaurant, we ordered Masala Papad to start with, then had aloo-pyaaz paratha, missi paratha and Paneer Do Pyaaza along with Dry Fruit Lassi. Each and every item was perfectly crafted and fabulous, except the Lassi - which was not as cold as I would have liked it to be (I like my Lassi ice-cold).  Overall, a good experience - and quite mouth-watering food (apart from the Lassi, that is) - I would definitely go back and try the other dishes again. Oh - and did I mention the huge (and I mean HUGE) blob of butter that came with the Aaloo-Paratha :)  Here is my overall verdict:   Service - 4.5 (Extra points for the smiling waiter) Food - 4 (subtracting 0.5 for the Lassi) Ambience - 3 (not really a place you go for the ambience) Value for Money - 4"
3.5,"A decent place to enjoy a good Punjabi meal after a long hard day's work. Friendly staff, value for money, delecious food. What else does one need at the the end of the month when pockets are getting lighter."
4.5,Went to this place on recommendation of a friend. The place lived to its expectation. One can get proper Punjabi cuisine here. We ordered parathas with lassi. Lassi is something which one must give a try. Mix paratha and aloo paratha reminds of the taste that one get at dhabas in north. The makkhan that we get here is the home-made one ( white ) which further makes it a treat. Cheese paratha wasnt that great as the bar was set too high by mix paratha and aloo paratha. We ordered veg kolhapuri which was delicious. We didn't order any starters or dessert though. The place is not for the people who are looking for ambiance but the food is something which scores high enough to make up for that. It's totally value for money as well. Have been there thrice till now. Highly recommended for people looking for punjabi food. You won't be disappointed.
4.5,"The wait on a Sunday night, for your turn is totally worth the food and hospitality that you get at your table... By far the best vegetarian food you will have in Bengaluru... If you want to have a Sunday dinner at this place, better leave early and don't have a heavy lunch because you would want to experience the food here... Well all I have to say at the end is... Burrrrah!!!"
4.0,"I'd rate this place 4.3/5.0.Kapoor's Cafe has become one of our favorite places for some good Punjabi khana. Here's why:  Ambience Reminds me of a Dhaba. Simple, a bit rustic. No fancy decor, just good old tables and plastic chairs. Typically full, people having conversations, laughing, orders being placed with enthusiasm, Punjabi songs playing in the background, so on and so forth. Not a fine dining place but then again, one usually measures the quality of Punjabi food against Dhabas and not fine dining places.  It is a vegetarian restaurant so (being vegetarian ourselves), it makes out lives easier because we can order anything from the menu.  Food There are two things that describe Punjabi food experience. a. taste, b. generosity. Kapoor's cafe scores well on both counts. Try their paranthas and you'll know why. It comes piping hot, with a huge dollop of makhkhan. We have tried their aaloo, gobhi, and the infamously heavy cheese parantha (which also comes with the same dollop of butter on top). Their chaas is absolutely delightful. Served in a kulhad (which they are happy to part with when you pack food from Kapoor's), it's cold, seasoned with jeera, coriander leaves and is truly refreshing. Their bread pakora with paneer is quite good too. Once you dig into the potato filling, the flavors take you straight to a typical samosewaala up north. Now to their main course. Their signature, in my opinion are their baingan bharta and aaloo gobhi (dry). These are seemingly simple dishes but they have simply aced these two dishes. Time after time, regardless of the demand or rush, the quality hasn't dropped one bit. The paneer butter masala is not the best out there but it makes the cut as a reasonable one. Their seasonal special makke di roti and sarson da saag is quite sublime. The best part is that their food comes very very hot and the first bite typically fills your soul, after which the tummy is automatically happy. The makke di roti comes with a dollop of white butter. What more can you ask for? :)  Desserts at Kapoor's don't offer much in terms of variety. Their shahi tukda is something I wouldn't recommend but theit chawal di kheer (again, servecold in a kulhad) is thick, creamy, flavorful and has the perfect amount of sweetness (at least for me). Brilliant stuff!  We;ve tried their breakfast special poori aaloo and they were outstanding as well.  Other (important) stuff: Their service is quite prompt too. One of the things I noticed was on one occasion, a server accidentally broke a bottle of cold drink. One of the owners was nearby and he didn't yell or shout at the server. A mere pat on the head and a smile and said something to the effect of ""it's ok but don't make a habit out of it"". That was very nice to see.  Price: a couple could eat their hearts out (2 starters, 2 main courses, 2 chaas, rotis/paranthas etc., 2 desserts) for about 800 bucks. I'd say terrific value for money.  In summary, Kapoor's cafe is an excellent choice if you're craving for a dhaba type experience. There are two things to keep in mind: a. pure vegetarian. b. Enter with a large appetite :) You will not be disappointed.  One suggestion for improvement would be to include a couple of more dessert options. Jalebi with rabdi and gulab jamuns would be nice :) Another would be to get a tandoor :) But quite frankly, I don't miss it one bit because their phulkas, paranthas and kulchas more than make up for it. And did I mention their generosity with their hospitality...reflected in the makhkhan that comes with them? :) You have to see it to believe it....it's just that once you see it, you won't stop eating here."
4.5,"This place does justice to its Zomato rating. The place is small with not too much fuzz . The ambiance could be better , but then who cares about the ambiance if the food is top class . I do not know where to start . All the food items that we ordered were exceptionally good.  The Lassi here is a must try (hardcore foodies will have only one complaint that the lassi glass should be bigger). Kapoors Cafe is the best example for good food in Bangalore . The price is reasonable . The quantity and quality of food is great . Paratha's are served with a chunk of butter on top .Not recommended for health freaks!!   This place is a must visit if you live anywhere is Bengaluru . Kudos to them !!"
4.5,"I've got 2 words for you. Must try!!  This place was recommended by a friend and I was thinking how good can a veg place really be.  But this Punjabi restaurant manages to kick some serious butt as far as food goes.  Located near marathalli, this place has ample parking and quite a bit of seating though if you come later than 8 on a weekend you'll probably have to wait a bit. They do home delivery as well which is awesome.  I tried their Gobi paratas , dal makhani , baigan bharta, and kheer. They have lovely phulkas and their lassi is superb. They also have different combos which are real value for money. Must tries are the paratas, lassi, dal makhani, kheer, baigan bharta and aloo Gobi subzi. The food is quite rich and heavy( as Punjabi food should be) so you can't eat there too often. I give this place a 4.5 only coz of the price. It's not cheap but it's totally worth it. Service - 4.5 Price - 4 Food - 5 Ambience - 4.5"
4.0,"Awesome food. We went all the way from Hennur, worth the drive n money. We ordered Aloo paratha and 3 different combos. The paratha was half inch thick with loads of filling and topped with butter. Never had aloo paratha like this earlier. Too gud. Keep it up."
4.0,An authentic dhaba experience with absolutely warm service and finger licking food! Its great value for money. One of the best places for veg north Indian food!
4.0,I am not a big fan of punjabi cuisine. But decided to try this place as it was very close to where we stay. We were here on a sunday night . The place was pretty crowded even at 10 pm and we had to wait for 30 min to get a table. Initially we were given one table but then the staffs asked us to shift to another one. This repeated again and finally we placed an order. We ordered assorted pakoras and stuffed parathas. The pakoras was not very great but the parathas were too good. Extremely friendly staff. Nice food overall. Service time is typically 30 min after you place the order. So better if ordered at once.  I wanted to give this place a 4.5 but giving a 4 for their very late service.
4.0,"Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambience: 2.5/5 VFM: 4/5 Great Indian Veg Punjabi style food. Parathas, daal makhani, paneer butter masala and palak. If someday you get up and have a craving for the Indian veg food, try this place. A little uncomfortable during afternoon cos of the heat."
4.0,When you are here.. there is no point in missing the lassi. And obviously butter covered paratha is heaven. So overall a very nice place. And awesome food.
4.0,"Went for dinner to this quaint out-of-sight Punjabi Caf this evening. Its about 1 km from Kundalahalli Gate towards Kadugodi on the left. Had heard a lot from people so despite being a non-veg food lover decided to try this place with 2 other staunch vegetarians. I led them to it so I was praying the food be good and it did not disappoint at all. :)  We ordered Cheese Paratha and Aloo Pyaaz Paratha and one Matar Paneer. And then finished off with lassis served in earthern kulhars.   Those who watch and eat, I suggest, should not expect to do so here. Like quintessential Punjabi hospitality,the luscious parathaas are served with dollops of butter which you can have the pleasure of spreading across your crisp golden parathas. Both the parathas were some of the best any of us had had.  Lassi was a delight in itself being cooling and soothing and just the right consistency.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Extra points for clean washrooms and hand wash areas.  A must go for vegetarians and fully deserving the ratings.."
5.0,"Best place to be with friends and have a nice meal with cheezy, crispy, mouthwatering and delicious food. The place is for the people who want to make their friends hefty and unwalkable after having the food here. Loved the place from heart."
3.5,"Frankly, this place could not live up to the hype. Had i gone there with zero expectations, i would have come out happier but i went in with a lot of expectations and it couldn't really live up to them. The food was, no doubt, good but unfortunately it wasn't as amazing as people had said it would be. The lassi, though, was exceptionally good! The aloo parathas and dal were not up to the mark though. You can't really fool a North Indian, more so a Punjabi, when it comes to Punjabi food. The paneer was nowhere close to how it's made in a Punjabi household or a dhaba. It could pass off as decent Punjabi food in Bangalore but certainly not anywhere in the north or for any Punjabi!"
4.0,"Kapoor's cafe authentic Punjabi style restaurant , located solely on the Varthur Road. Place is almost packed , talking about food it's purely veg but great taste and complete value for money , their lassi with smiley on the top is awesome . We tried their snacks Punjabi style French fries , pyaz aloo pakodas and lassi . Must try . Highly recommend for veg and non veg people both ."
5.0,Excellent restaurant. Those working in and around whitefield should go here. The quality of food is up to the mark and taste wise it's superb. Their lassis are a must try. Very different from what you get outside. Even though the prices are same as any big restaurant it's completely worth it. Getting tables on weekends is a challenge here and even on Friday afternoons it's filled. The menu is so tempting that you feel like ordering all but I would suggest you should visit multiple times in order to taste all the dishes. Just forget your diet for that one day when you are visiting. Overall the food they serve is yum and it's worth the penny. The staff and the owners are very friendly and they help you order if in case you are confused at to what to try.
5.0,"Everything is up to the mark and food exceeds expectations.. Coolers on windows reminded me of a typical Delhi eatery.. Loved it.. :) If possible, we would love to see Firni and Ras Malai in your desserts list. :)"
3.5,Finally after a long time i had the taste of real north indian parathas....its been after a long time that my stomach got full in one paratha....though went there unknowingly but the food is really awesome....try out the cheese paratha....real heavy stuff with a matka of lassi...#northindiantaste #stomachfull
4.5,Layout and ambience of the cafe is typical delhi style. Food was really delicious. I actually felt that I had real punjabi food. Quantity and quality are upto the mark. Worth every penny. Must visit place. I would definitely be a regular customer of this cafe.
4.5,"So went for quick lunch on Friday and oh my god I couldnt work after that.   Ordered  1.  Paneer pakora very nice 4/5 paisa vasul 2. Lassi in kullad.  Awesome 4.5/5 3. Paneer and alu Paratha with lots of butter 4.5/5 paisa vasul 4. Dal makhani,  I have had better but it was very nice 4/5 5. Butter Milk was good but was fika after having lassi 3.5/5  Please do not expect big from ambience as it is like college canteen :)  but who cares if food is awesome over all 4.5/5"
3.5,"Should definitely check out this place. The food here is punjabi in real sense. We ordered paneer do pyaza, Punjabi tadka,  boondi raita,  aalu pyaaz paratha n fulka. To our surprise the quantity was good enough for 3 to split. Lassi is really great which they give in kulhad. I went there on Sunday afternoon which could be the reason for so much crowd n slow service. But the staffs are very nice to you."
4.5,"Its USP is authentic north indian dilli style tasty food. More of the types I will find in outer city dhabas of delhi, with parathas and lots of butter. Though seating is not dhaba style with cots, but food would taste similar. Their cooks are probably from north india so you will not feel any south indian touch.  Try parathas and lassi or phulkas. Its not a fine dine, infact towards a little uncomfortable seating. No AC, you will find dilli style water cooler, but effective. Honestly the place looks cheap but not the people visiting it.  Its the place you go for food and not for ambience but still do go for food. As per standards of bangalore its prices are low. Dinner in Rs 300 for two in high rated restaurant, not easy in bangalore. I got a nostalgic feeling of restaurant I used to frequent in college days with friends, and shared the Rs 300 bill.  I didn't give rating 5 because they are short of staff and service is not good. Its better if you order as much as you want in one go, instead of multiple rounds of starters or main course. If they don't get you something shout and ask for it. Don't keep waiting and getting irritated. Its run by a family, father was at billing and sons were serving, probably ladies managing kitchen. The owners were very welcoming and accepted issues in the service and also said they are working on it, so no complaints."
4.5,"We went to Kapoor's cafe last night after reading and hearing some rave reviews about this place. Reached at around 9:15 pm and it was super crowded. We were asked to wait for 30 minutes and given a waiting number which was being called out as tables were getting free. And I must say that the person who was managing the crowd was doing a very good job, he was polite and efficient and we got a table at around 10pm. We ordered the Rajma combo and Chandigarh special along with masala papad. The food was yum and totally worth the wait! The Chandigarh special had a dry fruit lassi that was full of cashews and tasted divine. It also had 2 aloo parathas which were huge and soft and topped with the most generous helping of butter iv seen in Bangalore! The Rajma combo had rice, fulkas, aloo jeera and Rajma masala. The aloo jeera was less in quantity but we didn't mind because the rajma made up with its taste. It was soft and slightly tangy and very very flavorful. The meal costed us only 300 bucks and was complete value for money. I'm surely coming back here!"
2.0,We went for dinner on weekend and faced mix of experience. Good: 1. Very Economical (INR400 for 2) 2. Good taste  Not so good: 1. Place was over crowded due to weekend. 2. Extra oily dishes 3. Fulka were enough thick 4. Very late serving 5. Very limited sweet options; in that kheer had gone foul taste (confirmed with manager)
3.5,"Yummy lassi! That's what comes to my mind when I hear kapoors cafe. Friendly people, good north Indian parathas and overall a nice experience. Its a pure veg restaurant located near kundanahalli gate on the way to Whitefield. It's difficult to spot it though. I now go frequently for their lassi. It's a must try."
4.0,"Nice little place with good food, really liked sarso da saag , and price is reasonable too. Try out dry fruit lassi , it goes well after intense session of badminton @Gurukul . Points of improvement would be ambience and space ."
3.5,"Nice place and nice food. Specially lassi. We had ordered stuffed parata and dal makhni,it was average. Please let me know the mist delicious dish of Kapoor's cafe."
4.0,"After a month of moving into Bangalore & in whitefield, the biggest challenge was to find a Pure Vegetarian restaurant which served good Punjabi / North Indian food, Finally got this place listed on Zomato with a good feedback.  It wasn't a bad choice of having food. I went at 8.15 ish & then the crowd started coming in. Peppy Punjabi music being played created a mood. I was attracted by the kulhad lassi, thick & tasty. A dhaba style restaurant. Very friendly & courteous people  Panner Makhanwala a different taste altogether ... used to have a Orangish Red gravy, this was red, just like Tikka Masala gravy. Was this authentic? dont know ... but liked it.  After a month of rotis made with maida, maida & maida finally got this Whole Wheat paratha, enjoyed every bite of it.  A good place to go to, if you are ok with a not so good ambiance like a proper restaurant (this place isn't bad). Don't be surprised to find 'Lizards' on the walls ... probably pets to keep the mosquitoes away ;) ... complements the dhaba style  I will go there again, of'course without my wife, who is afraid of the ...."
3.5,Good food...good service...if anybody plans to visit this place...try only lassi n paranthas.......we tried Punjabi French fries as well they were average...hospitality was good...even though it was full house ... Everything was well managed...
4.5,Visited this place on a Friday night with a few friends.Its a tiny little place but the food here is mouth watering!Absolutely loved the punjabi daal.This place is a must go for anyone living around Whitefield.
5.0,"In one line, absolute delight... Menu, taste, service and last not the list, the way they welcome you and make comfortable.  Paranthas are best in town."
4.0,"After hearing good reviews about the food here we decided to visit this place on a weekend, and as expected waited for 40-45 mins to get a small table in this cozily crowded restaurant. To begin with, the paneer pakodas here combined with their kulhadd lassi was surely a lip smacking combination. We also tried the Gobi paratha and Cheese paratha, which were both prepared very nicely. They also have planner gravy meal combos which are not as good as other items on the menu but at the same time are not at all disappointing.  After our first visit, we have surely become a regular to this place (also, they have expanded the seating area and can now accommodate more people)  All in all the place is good for authentic Punjabi food; the only worry (for me) is they serve only veg food. Definitely worth trying!"
4.0,"If you love authentic Punjabi food and have been drawing blanks throughout the city in search for the same,here is what you are looking for. Located in the dusty suburbs of Whitefield,in a compound that welcomes you under the name of a local sports academy,Kapoors Cafe is a place you shouldn't miss. I was there on a weekday evening with my sister after zomato convinced about this place with its high ratings and lovely reviews.The place was almost full even for a lousy monday evening. We had parathas,dal makhni,kadai paneer and lassi each and every one of which was of top quality and authentic. Dal was slow cooked and with a traditional smoked flavor while the parathas were topped off with a generous helping of butter sticking to the tradition of the land from where it comes from. The lassi was thick and sweet served in traditional matka glasses at the perfect temperature. With the kind of food they serve one tends to ignore the minor lapses in ambiance and service but with the kind of traffic they get they can surely employ more than the current 3 people who do the serving,thereby improving the service time as well. All said,great place not to be missed."
4.5,I found this place on zomato and suggested it to my friends.already everyone has visited this place twice atleast.location is inside gurukul sports academy complex and the restaurant is not that big but they manage it really well.the staff are friendly and owners are very good.the seating may be small but there are air coolers to cool u down.nothing will matter when the food is served because the food is just the best.true punjabi food is hard to find in bangalore.ghee fulkas and tasty butter parathas and lassis and paneer lababdar and many more dishes.you can try anything because everything is tasty.the thali is huge and can be eaten by two people.the parathas are filled with veggies and topped with big handful of butter.the puri chole are super tasty too.lassi is great but it was a little warm.overall best place to try vegetarian punjabi food.
4.0,"This place was suggested by a friend. Reached here on a hot Sunday afternoon. The first impression was not good as ambiance was of dhabha type and it was overcrowded and people waiting. Luckily for us we got a seat early. We ordered lassi and chaach, masala papad, daal tadka. Paneer do pyaza, aloo paratha, white makhhan, plain paratha, pudhina paratha and chilli paratha. The chaach and lassi were served in kulhhad which gave authentic field. Rest of the food was very tasty. Left me craving for more. All that for a bill of just Rs 650. Will definitely visit the place again, good food, reasonable prices and courteous staff."
4.5,Seems very tiny hotel..but when it comes to  food..its just mind blowing...awesome taste..pocket friendly...if u r visiting here...go for a LASSI for sure..it's heavenly awesome.....                                                                 chetanchauhan.in
4.5,"Craving for Punjabi Cuisine in Whitefield? Don't think much, start your trip towards Varthur Road and Stop near Tubarahalli bus stop and get into Kapoor's Cafe which is in Gurukul Sports Compound. Well, one of my friends invited me to this beautiful place for lunch. I happened to reach around 2.30pm and the restaurant was almost occupied with corporate geeks. As soon as I entered, I could smell, the taste of butter which was heavenly feeling. I started my lunch with Aloo Onion Paratha which is served with Dahi, Pickle and Green Chutney. I don't say whether it's authentic or traditional, but excellent stuffing of Aloo & onions with chunks of green chillies in Paratha. It was upright with decent spice level. A dollop of butter added on paratha made it bright :) I was not in a position to order any other dishes honestly, but ended up with pherni, tasty Lassi and fruit cream. Lassi was much needed to beat the summer heat and it was authentic! Fruit Cream was something unique to me and never heard before about this dessert, it is heavily one in Kapoor's Cafe and must try without fail. The restaurant has got a beautiful interiors and exteriors! The place is equipped with powerful desert coolers to give a pleasant feel in dining area. Service was very quick during my visit and folks who owns this place are very polite and takes feedback from every table without miss! Price is slightly higher, but excellent food and Service! Highly recommended place for Punjabi Cuisine :) Quality: 4.5/5 Taste: 4.75/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5                                             bangaloreepicure.com"
4.5,"Visited this place for the first time this Saturday with a couple of friends.   Staff was super friendly and attentive. All of them interacted with a smile on their face. We ordered all the paranthas listed in the menu except cheese and alu. Paranthas were served with a tablespoon of butter on top of them with green chutney amd achar.  And believe me the Paranthas were so tasty that one wouldn't require to use chutney or achar with them, atleast I ate it all with just butter on top of it.   Lassi is also quite good here (served in a kulladh).  I had ordered Chole bhature too, but didn't find them up to the mark (as compared to their parantha).   All in one sentence, I really liked this place and would definitely be going again to try other items for the menu."
4.5,Great food. Excellent service. Hospitable staff. Kudos to the team. Definitely recommended. Everything from starter  to main course to desserts is gooood. I liked the lassi specifically. Their combos are also value for money.
4.5,"Kapoor's Cafe serves wholesome Punjabi veggie food at a reasonable price. We ordered assorted pakoras, chole bature, gobi paratha and a few combos. Everything we ate tasted very good and fresh which is why I'm assuming they don't use any synthetically produced additives like ajinomoto or baking soda. Just the right amount of salt and spices. I specially liked their lassi which is thick and just perfect (not too sugary). The staff are really courteous and friendly. Aill in all, this is a place where you can eat everyday and never get bored. At least in my case."
4.5,After a long time of planning finally we reached our destination that's KAPOOR'S CAFE..Typically north Indian style with panjabi flavor...oji maza he aa gaya si....aloo paronthe with butter te thandi lassi/chach....just loved it...will visit soon to try other items too..:-)
3.0,Ambience was simple. Started with lassi- very good but it was very sweet like a dessert. Dal makhani was ok. Paneer lababdar was good enough except that it has quite a lot of spices. Overall ok experience.
4.0,"Being from Delhi, it feels good to come to an outlet which gives you authentic Punjabi dhaba experience. We ordered lassi and chaach which were very very good. We ordered them twice. Then we had masala papad which was also tasty. The Gobi paratha came with a huge amount of butter and was stuffed to the core. It came with green chutney that was a delight to eat. Then we ordered two different paneer combos which were somehow very bland and really disappointing. However overall service was good. The manager and owner were very considerate, they took our feedback too. I would visit this outlet again surely and maybe this time will go for breakfast."
3.5,"I had been here with my friends, had ordered lassi, butter milk, masala papad and paneer combos. Highly recommend you to have lassi, but the combos were a little disappointing.  Service in the restaurant was very good, friendly people. The owner who was sitting in the cash counter made sure he inquired about the experience."
4.5,Read the reviews and went with a lot of expectations. This place really lived up. Very tasty food. Excellent and prompt crew. Had a great dinner!
4.0,The crowded place with great punjabi food .i had visited this place two times.both the time service was slow but food was delicious and nice. we had lot of varities here.the snacks included paneer pakodas.the lassi is must to have here.the parantas serverd here is different and good.the main course was also good paneer and daal.Thefood is pretty reasonable  Service 3/5 food 4.5/5 quality 4.5/5
5.0,Let me start by saying I eat non-veg everyday for lunch but my frnd forced me to eat veg at Kapoor's cafe. But it turned out to be the best Punjabi food I have ever eaten other than dhaba next to gurdwara. Their food is deliciously delicious. I enjoyed every bite of food. Ambiance isn't that good but must for food lover. I am a foodie and loves to try new flavour and this is one of the top...go for it and experience it yourself
4.5,"Two visits in three days to Kapoors Cafe. Really enjoyed the food. The assorted pakoras were done great. The paratha - great filling and topped of with more than generous amounts of butter. Loved the panner do pyaza and the aloo zeera, the shahi paneer was tad disappointing (was a little too sweet). The buttermilk and boondi raitha was good. Missed the desert , so will definitely go back for Shahi Tukra. Last but not the least, quick service and personal attention from the owners."
4.5,"This place is famous for all the right reasons. The food is delicious, staff behaviour and service at its best, restaurant is easy to locate, pocket friendly and ambience is fine.  And, the gentleman at the billing counter will greet you will a big smile asking ""Beta, khana accha laga?"" :)  Must try: Aloo Paratha and Lassi  If the owners maintain the quality and taste of food as it is, they have a long way to go.  I surely recommend this place to all my friends and colleagues."
4.5,"The best place to have vegetarian food. Great taste, quality and hospitality. Initially the service was too late, now it has been improved.  PS: Must visit!!"
4.5,"Authentic punjabi cuisine , Great hospitality and such cool ambience and it completes it .. Been here a lot . have tried almost every veg dish From Assorted pakodas to kullad lassi to shahi paneer and not to forget their own Cheese parantha . and all this with effective price and such fast service. Just go there once and you will go there again .   Food : 4.5/5  Price Worth : 4.5/5  Cleanliness : 4/5"
4.5,I saw a lot of good reviews on Zomato and decided to visit this place with a friend. the place is decent (not great ambiance but the food tasted brilliant. Regretting that I was missing out on such a good place in my neighborhood. We ordered a cheese paratha which was loaded with cheese and butter and it was just yummmm..... We also ordered a chole bhatura combo which was good and the lassi was just too good. If you go to this place you should surely have lassi here.... Planning to have a lot more meals from this place in future. I am also keen on trying their food delivery option which is recently started.
3.5,"Having heard alot about the place and seen a lot of good reviews on Zomato, I visited the place today . The ambience of the place is cool just like a cute dhaaba . There were lot many tables which were all full so had to wait for 10 min to get a table.  They serve veg food only so that's a plus for pure vegetarians who are strict in their diet ! We ordered kadai paneer, Dhaabe di daal , khasta parantha , fulkas and lassi. The food was good in taste as well as presentation . Lassi was yumm !  I have only one recommendation for the owners to probably look out for tandoori items as well since they are currently serving only tawa items in breads and maybe they'll be able to increase their menu options as well.  The place is a must visit to try atleast :-) I missed to mention earlier, the behavior of all people working there is super cool towards customers and look forward to serve you with pleasure . Liked that alot !"
4.0,Great ambience.. Loved the treatment..  Great information about food..  Five if more option for food was available   Card and cash payment available
4.5,"Being a punjabi vegetarian..this place comes as a delight for me. The highlight is the Lassi for sure. I have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would suggest the best time to have food here is lunch time as it is not that crowded. The restaurant is j packed on weekends and you might end up waiting for 30 mins. The food is spicy enough and I like the price ranges for combos from 150-450. The preparation is neat and the staff too warm. The breakfast though is something they need to improve on. But an overall great place with some great punjabi music playing in the background. :)"
3.5,"The desi vibe buzzes from this place. The food is great but service was slow, not much cleanliness, and less staff. Dont miss the lassi cuz it is awesome...."
4.5,"My Favorite joint for Punjabi Cuisine. The dishes are so tasty especially the gravies. such as Baingan ka bharta, Panner Makhni are on top of my list followed by shahi pulao, chilli onion fried rice. To top them all, the lassi and chaas served in a matki is pure divine. Quite pricey as the spices being used are all home made. Thumbs up for anyone who want to visit this place"
4.0,"Sizzling hot Rajma Chawal, Butter filled Gobi Paratha & chilled lassi served in a matka, makes your perfect meal. To top it off, lovely warm people around make you feel at home."
3.5,A place with a very very good taste of punjabi food !! U will definitely love the food but the ambience reminds me  of a unmanaged dhabba and on the top of it u can go only for dinner because if opted for lunch can suffer from heatstroke .. Because its too hott inside the restaurant u cant enjoy the food in daytime
5.0,"Rustic charm, lip smacking food, run by good hearted people, what else one needs?!?! The food here is freaking spectacular. Must Try is the kachori-chole, which is basically, stuffed puris (pethe waali puri), parathas are served with generous dollop of amul butter. Lassi is probably the best in Bangalore (but don't compare it to the ones in Delhi and Amritsar). The ambience, is dhAba-like.  Little tricky to get to this place, since there are no directions, its inside gurukul gymkhana, Opposite CCD, they have pinned the location on Google Maps accurately. One word for this place - Nostalgia!"
4.0,"Must try: Assorted pakoda plate We reached the place quite early, nearly 8 pm, hence it wasn't crowded. The ambience was quite nice, fitted with coolers and all. We ordered a plate of assorted pakoda, cheese paratha, peas pulao, Paneer do Pyaza and phulkas to go along. We tried the Lassi that comes in a matka - the presentation of the Lassi was nice - we even got a smiley in it..felt so happy.  The phulkas were soft and warm. Cheese paratha was very cheesy,  and we gobbled it up.  All in all, I liked the place, and the food. I would recommend to all who miss Punjabi food. I was touched when asked by the person sitting at the cash counter (also owner??)  ""Beta, khaana pasand aaya? """
4.0,"May 2015 - We ordered Tea, Pakora Platter and Cheese Paratha. Everything was amazing. The Tea was so good we had to order it again. Pakora Platter had onion pakora and paneer pakora. The Cheese Paratha was absolutely mind blowing. It beats cheese burst pizza in terms of Cheese. And to top it all was the bill. The ambience is dhaba type. A great place!                                                                 thewhatsupguy.in"
4.5,"This was my 3rd visit in 10 days. Found it on zomato and the reviews were so good that I had to try. The first time we went, we were a group of 12 so it took some time to get a table. We ordered the aloo-pyazz pakora, masala papad and lassi to begin with. It was amazing. Paneer lababdaar was next with different rotis for everyone. The curry was yummy with supersoft paneer. The parathas are so soft and filling that one was enough for me.  The second time we tried paneer butter masala and I'm a fan of it now. The French fries with punjabi twist is a very smart dish. The third time I wasn't very hungry so I order a lassi and Gobi paratha. The paratha was served steaming hot and with a big dollop of butter. The owner and staff are very friendly. The service is efficient. In love with this place."
4.0,Great food. Great service. Waiting times have reduced because of the increased space inside. Slightly over priced for the ambience (especially after the extension) and crockery. Some work to do on those aspects!
4.5,Bhai waah!! Shaandar khaana... badhiya paraathe. . Badhiya aur ekdum ghar jaisa khana. Really awesome. The preparations were quick and really tasty... lassi served was heavenly and so was the aaloo pyaaz paratha and cheese paratha  A special mention to the cheese paratha... this was the unique blend of  indian and italian flavours...and the final result was great taste at the best. The place has a decent ambience which is compensated by the great taste. My only qualm and suggestion to them was to make use of Amul butter for the best possible taste and for that i could have given 5 star rating as well  Do try for a casual lunch or dinner .. and you will not be disappointed.
4.0,Nice location for a simple chat or dinner. Everybody should try delicious dry fruit lassi. Pakoras are also superb with Punjabi flavor.  I suggest everyone to have a try
5.0,Cme early and waz waiting for the Restaurant to open in the evening. Restaurant opened and we ordered for Dry fruit Lassi... One of the best lassi I have tasted in my life..
4.5,Went to have dry fruit lassi as they mentioned in zomatoo.. But mistakenly I got normal lassi and then they put dry fruits and gave.. Better to have the normal one that was simply cool .. Didn't tried anything else since I don't have money to pay as their swipe machine was not working ... But with the dry fruit lassi itself I was full.. So didn't went to tale money..  Better next time will try more.. Waiting for the next visit .. Hope it will be soon  So visited again superb fud and service  Cost effective too.. Love to take cousins n friends.. Mouth watering irresistible double cheese paratha..
1.0,As per the reviews was expecting delicious food!!But after long waiting got food with no taste and quantity is also too less so a NO GO from my side
4.0,"Had a hearty meal every time we've been family. Typical, family-run North Indian Bhada bang in the middle of Whitefield. Its Pure Veg - but the food is so tasty, and there's so much variety that one will not miss non-veg. The highlights for me were the Lassi served in a mud cup, and the Onion Paratha!"
4.0,"Heard about this place from a friend sometime back and recently while looking for a restaurant to have dinner its name again popped up so I decided to give it a shot although it was pure veg! :P Quite a small place with a very big waiting queue but they are able to manage the crowd pretty well. We got our table in 20 minutes. Do not care about the ambiance of the place for the food is going to make you forget everything. Authentic north Indian Punjabi food with a very big menu to choose from! We ordered a bread paneer pakoda, kadai paneer combo and one paratha combo which included a cheese and paneer paratha, raita and shahi tukda! The shahi tukda just made my day.  Everything else was simply yummy and quite heavy since they don't hesitate in putting extra butter (Punjabi style) Service is very fast and the staff will make you feel that you are not in Bangalore any more! Cheap on pocket too. PS - don't forget to try their lassi!"
4.0,"First of all this a pure veg food joint! A fantastic place to have North-Indian food. The menu is good and preparation is excellent!! The best part is, food here does NOT taste like a commercial preparation, its homely and refreshing. I have been a regular visitor and there has been nothing to complain about so far. It is always a great and fulfilling experience at Kapoor's cafe.  Service is one area where they have some scope for improvement, but not bad!  Last but not the least the bills are actually pocket-friendly!!"
3.5,"Had Cheese Paratha (Double Cheese - irresistible) and two glasses of lassi here for dinner one evening. The lassi was irresistible indeed but the cheese paratha not so much.  Kapoor's Cafe is one of the most convenient places for those who come to Gurukul often. I'm definitely coming back here for their amazing lassi and since there's so much hype about this place, I hope the other options on their menu are better.  - with Ruchika Sarma"
4.5,Well I had heard a lot about this place from my friends. Though my first experience was not that good as i had ordered a weird combination of missi roti with rajmha.. Still I tried it for the second time. This time it was awesome.. They serve the best food at a very reasonable price. Combos are the best!!
4.0,"If you want to visit very good vegetarian restaurant, this is the place to go to. Very pocket friendly.  Foodwise, this place specializes in Punjabi food and I know many would think how can a Punjabi restaurant be a vegetarian restaurant, but trust me the food is good.  Must try: Dal tadka lassi, chaaz. Also, the thing about these beverages is that they are served in a cool cute looking matkas which adds to the authenticity of the restaurant  Ambience wise is not the best looking restaurant out there but it is not bad looking either. Also accessing this place might be difficult for first timers.  Staff is also courteous and quick. If the quality is maintained in the future, this will be become one of the best in Bangalore."
4.5,"For past two months, we had been planning to visit Kapoor's Cafe, and we finally got the chance to go there for dinner a couple of days ago. The place isn't very difficult to find. The staff there are very friendly. It is a decent place if you go by ambiance but the food makes up for it big time.  We ordered Lassi and French Fries Punjabi Style. Trust me, you will fall in love with the lassi with the first sip itself. Fries were different from what you usually expect and we really enjoyed them. We then ordered Aloo Paratha and their special Triple Cheese Paratha. They are a must try here for sure.  The prices are quite reasonable and the food is awesome. Deserves a 5 for Value for Money.  I am surely coming back here again."
3.0,Used to be frequent visitor here and liked it quite a bit..but visited this recently couple of times and noticed quality has drastically come down in last one year..unable to manage the crowd and maintain the quality of food!
3.0,"Went to this place after reading rave reviews on zomato, I am north Indian and know how the food really tastes. We ordered rajma, rice and makki ki roti with saag. Saag was way below average, makki ki roti had super bad oil being used, rajma could pass off as your average dhaba in north rajma. In all an average place that@ acts like a solace with pocket friendly north Indian food for all staying in that area of Bangalore. Biggest mention is that service that the family which owns the place give, the father son duo are super :)"
3.0,"Very oily, some desserts are frozen, not freshly cut, although they are pricy. Today the onions that came with the chole were stale and spoilt. So I get the feeling they do not serve fresh food."
4.5,"Authentic punjabi food, with lot of scoops of butter on every dish which makes the meal even tastier. To the people who are in diet...it's worth breaking your diet chart... Parathas n Lassi would be a must try out here.."
5.0,"Can't expect better than this at this price or even for more. The food is authentic punjabi and its really awesome. Also owner is very friendly,  had lassi,  paneer butter masala,  paneer lababdar and many more items.  Nothing to complain of,  best place in Kundalahalli."
3.5,"After planning for several weekends, we finally went to Kapoor's cafe.Placed on a sidelane on the road from Kundanhalli to Whitefield, this place isn't very hard to find; thanks to the conspicuous board on the main road.  There was a very nice, welcoming gentleman sitting on the porch as we entered.The sitting is simple and neat. The food was decent. The dal and parathas were quite nice and the lassi in kullhar was a refreshing change. But the butter on the parathas, I don't think it's Amul butter. I judge a paratha by the butter on it :P Maybe, if they could provide the white butter made at home (even if on a special rate), it would just enhance the flavour. The chola bhatura combo could be improved. All in all, it's a decent North Indian place and it's value for money."
4.0,This place???the food reminds me of delhi..finger licking good food....every dish you name is so yum...i just wish it had a pretty big space...
5.0,"This place provide you food with the exact taste you want! Being an North Indian, it truly matches with my taste buds. Breakfast tea is one of the best to start your weekend with, Aloo-puri is one of my favourite. This place is heaven for paratha lovers, Aloo & gobhi paratha is awesome. recently, they have installed coolers also to get rid of hotness of weather, which creates sort of ""desi feel"" in that place! :)"
3.5,"Nice place to have good food which feels like homemade food. I had heard alot about this place so had went there.  Frankly I found it over rated, I felt it is just like any other place with decent food, but on Zomato ratings are highly over done, atleast according to me.  Ordered Daal Sabzi combo. I found daal decent enough. But breads here are not upto the mark. Parathas were little under cooked and had to specify that to the chef. Chaas was good, quite freezing. Rest everything was OK."
4.0,"You don't miss non-veg food when you are eating at this veg restaurant!!  Flavour is truly ""maa ke haath ka khaana"" types!! Love going there, very homely feeling!! :)"
3.5,"Hmmmm...  since,its damn difficult to find some good north Indian food in Banglore, this is not a bad place to dine in.  All those who dig for good ambience, sorry folks this place is not for you.  Prices won't burn a hole through your pocket .  But, what kills the mood is the service it's terrible . since, the cafe lacks in staff big time thus, there maybe a chance when you have to beg for an empty glass to pour some water into and quench your thirst but the silver lining is the staff is friendly.  So, on the whole if you crave for some good North Indian food especially, fulka(i.e tawaa roti, 10 bucks a piece) then do visit this place."
4.0,"Very good place and food with simplicity. Paratha's are the best and especially the cheese one. Interiors need a improvement but food is good. Lassi was very nice - authentic one, remembered Chandigarh. Value for money."
3.5,"I came here on a Saturday night with my husband and brother in law. The place is like a pakka tent and ambience pretty much dhaba type. Definitely needs some insect repellents. We had to wait for 15 min since they do not take reservations on weekends.  Finally we got seated and ordered lassi, paneer butter masala, dal makhani, phulka and paranthas.  Lassi came in first and was very good so we ordered in some more. The food took almost an age to come. The taste was that of a good home cooked food, nothing jaw dropping and hence a rating of 3.  Overall its a nice place to have home like food if you are around in the locality. Recommended for students and professionals from North India staying away from home.  P. S. - an extra 0.5 for being pure vegetarian."
4.5,Parathas... Parathas... Especially cheese paratha. You will really forget domino's or Any other pizzas. Buttermilk is great. Desserts are ok. They need to set up their wash basin and wash room.  Services are excellent. Ambience is ok
3.5,"If you want to taste good punjabi food and bored of visiting other north indian/punjabi restaurants, then you can visit this place. Everything is good. Table reservation is recommended else you may find a big waiting queue Everything is great as such here & you can enjoy the punajbi Cuisine. Food is good and prices are affordable and worth. Also its inside gurukul sports complex you may miss it if you are high on speed."
3.5,"I had been to this sports complex once to swim .. I noticed kapoor's then , it seemed a busy restaurants ... After quite a few efforts i finally landed there with a friend as we were on a hunt for mekke ki roti and sarso da saag .. The perpetration was good ... We had ordered some bread pakoras which were over fried .. They give lassi in khullar... It was a nice experience overall .."
4.0,"This place had been on my bucket list for a long time. We happened to come here on a hot Friday afternoon during lunch time at work. As I could see, this place is not much for ambiance. It's a small cosy place where emphasis is put on food rather than the seating. We ordered lassi, Punjabi French fries, paneer lababdar, vegetable kolhapuri, dal makhani, ghee phulka, and butter milk.  Lassi came first, it was served in mud kulhad. Which didn't just give it an authentic feel, but a cool one as well. It helped us relax since we had come by bus in the heat. It was very tasty. Then the French fries arrived. They very normal French garnished with fried mint leaves and chilli powder. Served with mint chutney and ketchup. It disappeared as it came, it was that yummy. Then mains were served. Ghee roti was topped with a lot of ghee. And so were the vegetables. It added to the taste. Made it yummier!! The vegetables were very aptly spiced. Not more not less. The butter milk was also great. Again served cool in kulhad. All this added to an amount of 1185! Which is a perfectly reasonable amount for the amount of food we ordered.  Well, while everything was great, I and I'm sure many others would be really grateful if tandoori roti and naans could be added to the menu. I usually don't it phulkas outside of home but had to make an exception to try this place out."
4.0,"Unless someone read's about Kapoor's cafe in Zomato, noone would be able to find it easily. I go there almost once a month, and I have tasted all the parathas and we are a big fan of the Aloo-Pyaaz and Double Cheese Paratha. We have tried the Combo 6 (Paneer Lababdar is the highlight of this Combo) which is about 400 and sufficient for 2 people. Complete paisa vasool as they say and at the same time, I would definitely not say it is inexpensive. There are very few places where you get good parathas (usually you need a microscope to find pieces of aloo or maybe it is powdered aloo) and this is definitely one among them. The dahi should be even thicker as in Punjab, that is where I found it a bit disappointing. Saturdays / Sundays are full and the last time I checked , the place is growing."
4.0,"Finally after hearing so much about this gem, I visited this cafe last week, my Punjabi spirit geared up and ready to gorge. As we entered and seated ourselves near the cooler, I liked the homely dhaba atmosphere, with the yummy aromas taking over me as I quickly ordered chaas, paneer butter masala and phulkas. The second the buttery chaas touched my lips and went in my tummy, I knew that this was going to be a good experience.  The paneer was creamy and masaledaar, just the way I like it, perfectly paired with hot phulkas. With all this yummy food complemented with a masala papad, onion + lemon on the side, and topped with chilled lassi served in the quintessential Desi Kullad, our tummies were full and smiles all around.  I would have loved the experience more if the lassi & chaas came in supersized servings and the portions of paneer and masala papad were generous (in typical Punjabi style), but hey, great food nonetheless !  Definitely coming back for more :)"
3.0,"I am a north indian living in south from last 11 year, Kapoor Cafe fools people by selling Lassi200ml for 50Rs which can come for 25-30Rs, can u imagine a phulka for 18 bucks..??thats crap..it costs 10 bucks, extra bhatura 30Rs, just opposite to Kapoor Cafe,,u have Dilli Wale &mast kalandar u get similar food for half price..guys come-on..u charge us for your good taste but dont fool us...or else i can sell same food in 40% less price infront of your cafe...however its tasty but overpriced food...but greed is bad sign...be reasonable ??"
1.0,"Overpriced, overrated and really bad ambiance. We decided to go to this place on the very day of Holi. We were told that they were serving Holi special thali, which was hardly a thali worth of money we paid, forget special. The place was burning with heat and bad smell all over the place. I asked the owner to give us a seat right below the fan as it was empty. He refused to give that place to us in a profusely rude manner and saying someone booked it already and they are eight and we were only six.Later, when they actually came , we found out that they were six only. Coming to the food , it was all greasy and apart from the starters, all curries had the same spices. A don't recommend this place at all."
4.0,"If you are looking for some good parathas in Bangalore, give Kapoor's Caf a shot!  It is a vegetarian restaurant ... so, no fancy keema parathasor the likes. What is highly likely to catch your fancy though is the good old fashioned aloo, onion, paneer parathas etc. You have chole bhature, sarson da saag and other subzis as well on the menu, but in the couple of visits I've made to Kapoor's Caf, I've not felt the need to go beyond parathas and lassi.The parathas (and you get two of them in one order) and the lassi are absolutely great. My wife tried sarson da saag ... wasn't that great. I've heard their chole bhature is good as well (and so are a few other dishes). To me though, Kapoor's Caf is a quintessential paratha place. To me, two things define a restaurant - food and service. And that is where Kapoor's Caf scores big! I've not been disappointed so far - by the parathas or the service - in either of my visits.  Let me temper your expectations though.The place is quite non-descript.In fact, unless you are carefully looking out for a inconspicuous signboard, you will most likely miss the place. It is on the Whitefield road, in front of Gurukul. There is enough parking - a few cars/bikes in front of the restaurant, but a lot of parking space behind it. Once you get there, the place will remind you of a college / hostel canteen of yore - functional furniture and a not-so-clean wash areathat may not inspire confidence ingoing for the regular, filtered water. Being a big fan of such pocket-friendly, hole-in-the-wall places, I don't mind that too much. The crowd really picks up on weekends ... and you need to brace yourself up for long wait times. Weekday lunches are usually a breeze.  Last I knew, they had not started home delivery yet, but I wouldn't be so excited about it either.After all, there is a certain charm of stuffing yourself with parathas (topped with a generous dollop of butter) in a commonplace setting!"
4.0,A small Punjabi restaurant which many of us might even not notice unless u have already heard about it....nothing fancy about this either...but it scores where it matters....the food is great with some fancy one liner in menu....on weekends u have to wait for some considerable time to get in but it's worth all that waiting...
4.5,The best Punjabi food you could find in Whitefield. Do not go on the quality or taste by the look of the cafe. My only suggestion to the Kapoor's please open a Non veg outlet too. PS- THE BEST LASSI YOU WILL EVER TASTE IN BANGALORE
3.0,"Little over hyped and over crowded place.. Not so good ambience. Ordered one thali with paneer do pyaza and dal makhani and fulkas with rice and sweets. Food was okay, not as per the rating given on zomato. Sweet dish has only 2 options.  Overall it was a ok ok experience. .."
3.0,"One of the overrated places in bangalore. It's a Punjabi restaurant, I don't know why they have named it like this! I went there on a weekend under the guzzling sun in a hope that all the pain would worth the suffering but only to my agony.  Ambience:The places is located near Whitefield a little bit off the road. there are no trees or shades nearby the restaurant. there is no AC or cooler inside. An experience that will surely give you a khoon 'paseena' ka roti.  Food: I have been to many other good punjabi restaurants in bangalore and this is not even closer to them. We ordered dal makhni, kadhai paneer, kulcha, matar pulav and lessee.  Dal makhni was thin without any taste of ghee in it and was over garnished with corriender leaves. Kadhai paneer was also below average.  The good thing here was the lassi which they served in a little cute matka.  Verdict: As compared to other punjabi restaurants This is little expensive and food is also not good enough."
4.5,"We stumbled upon this place by chance. This has since then been our ""Go To"" place for paratha. The best parathas I have eaten in the Bangalore. The service is decently quick even when it's crowded without affecting the quality of food. The parathas are quite heavy plus they're served with a chunk of butter so 2 of them would fill you up. Must try: Cheese Paratha Gobi Paratha Chaach Fruit Cream"
4.5,"Sunday morning without Paranthas is a cause of concern for any punjabi. So here we land up at a cafe well hidden from plain sight with the help of zomato and Google maps. It's a small cafe like place with minimal decorations. But don't judge the book by its cover they say.  So we sat down and a very polite gentleman(probably the owner) came to take the order. His way of talking with the occasional 'beta - beta' made me feel welcome and at home.  The orders were placed which included a meal with chole bhature with lassi and shahi tukda ordered by my friend whereas a cheese parantha, aloo parantha and a lassi for me.  The lassi served in authentic clay pots was indeed as served in Punjab and the paranthas (loaded with butter ; slurp) were just as delicious. They write cheese parantha as a speciality and it truly lived up to its name for its filled with cheese and vegetables which ensures it is not bland. The chole bhature were also easily the best we have had in bangalore.  And best part was how economical it was.  All the food set back the wallet by a mere Rs. 400 which is less by bangalore standards  This is one place I would recommend every Punjabi to visit for authentic breakfast."
4.5,"Just like with any good eating outlet in Bangalore, waiting for a modest half hour during weekends is inevitable at Kapoor's cafe. But the wait is worth every second, for the place is enormous and rightly lit (evenings), housing an ambience inside its low hung ceilings with a glowing crowd under that will just make your meal one of the best! Orders are processed with decent speed, so you don't have to put up your annoying hungry face for long. The food served is up to the punjabi mark. Full points for that. However, as of the time of penning down this review, the place is getting a facelift that can be a sore sight to the eyes. I reccomend Kapoor's cafe after its facelift."
4.5,The best Authentic punjabi food I found in Bangalore till date.. Being a North Indian I used to miss it and without any doubts they serve the proper punjabi food.. I went there for a team lunch... A small place with not much investment on fancy stuffs with a small menu...their complete focus is on the quality of food... After being there for lunch I liked it so much that I went there the next day with my frnds too... Dal makhani was awesome.. With the lababdar paneer... They serve cold lassi and chach in matka which has an amazing flavour of matka... I also ordered a stuff parantha and it was too heavy that I could not finish it...   The best part is you get all this yummy food at such a low cost...
4.5,"Having heard so much about this place, my boyfriend and I decided to head over for a late breakfast/an early lunch to this cafe. What catches your attention is the Punjabi vibes this place exudes right from the board that welcomes you into the cafe to the menu written Punjabi style. This gives the feel of a Punjabi dhaba, with a very friendly and courteous staff, with pleasant smiling faces and greeting you and attending to you with patience. The ambience is average but the food more than makes up for it. Steaming hot parathas stuffed generously with a rich mixture of spiced aloos and masala and with a thick layer of melting hot cheese with onions and tomatoes and spices, and smeared generously with butter, these are easily the best ones I've had in ages. The chhole bhature with masala aloo sabzi and boondi ka raita was delicious and very filling. The shahi tukda was well made. And full points for the lassi served in matkas. This is a must visit for some decently priced authentic Punjabi food sans the non-veg. Food- 5/5 Services- 5/5 Ambience- 3/5 With Heerak"
4.0,"I went here with colleagues in first week of april 2015. Overall the place is good and I would revisit it again. The place was undergoing renovation as they were expanding the dining area. Ambience : Simple setup - nothing fancy about chairs or tables. The only catch is the place has aluminium sheet roofing and it gets very hot in summers once u start munching the very hot parathas. Be prepared to sweat out during lunch time. The lesser rating is mainly due to that. Food : We had parathas, 3 curries and curd to go with it and lot of chaas, lassi to beat the heat. The parathas were very good especially onion paratha. Mixed paratha was spicy and good while paneer paratha was salty. The curries shahi paneer, channa masala and dal were tasty. Price : The chaas, lassi portions are less for any paratha place. Even the pricing doesnt justify the portions of chaas and lassi. Rest of the items are VFM. Service : The waiter always had a smile in spite of sweating in the heat and made sure orders were brought out to us soon."
3.5,"The menu booklet was funny which raised the bar of my expectations on this place. But, I feel it is a little over rated. Ambiance was average or just above average and I felt the tables were close (may be I went during renovation). The food was the better part of this, tasting above average."
4.0,"When i think of kapoor's cafe , the next thing that crosses my mind is their Yummy Yummy cheese parathas, if u love cheese and parathas , this is the one thing that u must definitely definitely Try !! i might be a hard core non vegeterian and i wont order a single veg dish if the place serves non veg , but this place makes me forget non veg( i am sorry chicken!) . The lassi and the kheer is to die for. The only time i was slightly disappointed was when i had visited this place at around 10 pm, for dinner and the food wasnt up to the mark , the lassi wasn't chilled enough nor was the kheer as good as they make it every time . But still its a must visit place and very pocket friendly"
4.5,"I went in there to have lunch with one of my vegeterian frineds, I didn't believe in pure veg restaurants before as I am a Bong and love Nonveg. But to my surprise the food was just finger licking good... Although at first from outside the place would look like a shady place to have lunch, but as you walk through the doors you will find a very friendly environment. I had seen a very warm and friendly face at the cashiers counter which I am guessing is Mr. Kapoor.Now moving on to the food, I had ordered the most famed cheese paratha and the lassi. The nut lassi was a bit too much nutted for my taste, killing the real flavour of the lassi but the plain lassi was amazing and mind you it is completely different than any other lassi that you have had in this town. They serve you in a clay glass and you will have the feeling of having something so natural and pure, there is an aftertaste in the mouth and it did certainly go and fill up half of my stomach. The Cheese paratha came in with a large & generous spread of butter on top which I very dutifully spread across the huge paratha. I found there was this stuffing given between two layers of paratha which was filled with cheese. The entire thing just melt when you take the fist bite and you will realize why I am writing this long review for. I was blown away and I'd love to visit there once in a while just to have the taste of that paratha & the best part is the pricing, it is as pocket friendly as it gets.My friend had ordered Chole Bature, the alu sabzi was amazing which came along with the chole bature but the batures could have been better but nonetheless the entire package was amazing. The interior design of the place has a touch of creativity which you will really appreciate, but if the entire scene was taken to a better place in terms of the building strucuture and locality it would be one of the best Veg joint in town ;)"
3.5,Basic place.. with decent service... and good good. good for casual dine out. liked chach in kulhade and partha were good crispy.  parking of gurukul Academy is good.
5.0,"Its a place for north indian people missing home cooked food and this place will definitely revive all memories of great food that your mom makes. Just wonderful. Talking about the place and ambience, little small and has punjabi music playing in the background. Looks like a closed ""dhaba"" with kitchen also visible. We were a group of 7 that went there and the most delicious item had to be ""baingan ka bharta"". Apart from that we ordered ""gobi aloo"" and ""kadhai paneer"" which were also very good. But the icing on the cake was ""lassi"" served in a ""kullad"". I had 2 of those after eating so much and still I wanted more. It was absolutely brilliant. And no way it is expensive. Our per head cost was not even 200. So to sum it up, wonderful place, good ambience, excellent food, and hell cheap! I am definitely gonna go here again!"
3.5,"All the above rating on this restaurant is purely based on food, quality and taste. Despite having a limited menu, there food is so amazing that it reminds you of any highway dhaba.  Kapoor Uncle and their sons treat customers really well, but limited tables makes it annoying as you might have to wait long. But as they are expanding, so I feel they should be able to take care of it and become the best punjabi restaurant in bangalore."
4.5,Went at this place twice...Awesome place....great quality of food and moreover it is very fresh must try lassi and aloo paratha. Lassi given in kulhad tastes so good
4.5,Where do i start?  Its sucha happy place. Feels home. The food is Brilliantly amazing. It is Priced moderately which makes it easy on your pockets. Waiters are extremely polite and nice. All you punjabi food lovers. A place worth trying :)
4.0,"I am a non vegetarian, so much so that not a day goes by without meat. Being a regular at Gurukul Sports Academy, this place always gave positive vibes. And so it happened on a Friday, a colleague insisted on having dinner here, and dinner we had there. As always, the order from our table was in insane proportions. From cheese parantha, a must have, to paneer pakoda, and kadai paneer, phulka, paneer bhurji, ghee rice. I don't even remember the count of lassis we kept asking for. It was all very delicious. Especially, the lassi. If nothing else, you can simply stop by for lassi here. It had been a while I had parantha, the Punjabi way, i.e. a huge chunk of butter on top of the parantha. Well, I did miss the butter chicken, but it was worth it. Nice ambience, prompt friendly staff, quick service."
3.5,"This restaurant is really an ideal place for some really tasty food...I loved the simplicity of this place & the food was really tasty...I have been here couple of occasions n I was pretty happy with the food..No complains about it..  However, there are certain things they need to work on... The time they take to serve their parcel orders..I had to really wait for 55minutes to get couple of jeera rice, dal makhani n rajma.... Plus the quantity served for the rice was really less....even my cousin who eats in nibbles..felt the quantity was really less...  Apart from this, I am really happy with the food taste..."
4.0,Let me open just by saying awesome food(Authentic mini Punjabi restra nearby) with very good hospitality. Punjabi Lassi is simply irresistible. Little problem with some heating due to construction going on to expand as per owner word's which will be completed within a week.
4.5,"After the Bengali cuisine the other indian cuisine that I love is Punjabi cuisine. But there are so many cafes, dhabas and restaurants that have sprung up declaring themselves to be Punjabi restaurants that it is really hard to find an authentic one. This place is as it claims an authentic Punjabi cuisine. Staying just a few mints walk away this was in my bucket list for long but I was somehow averting it as it is a pure veg and all Bengalis are hardcore non vegetation. But today a sleepy me wanted to have a tasty Sunday breakfast and as in breakfasts veg is absolutely fine I headed to the place. It is a small cafe from the outside but more of a dhaba from the inside with small wooden tables chairs and some foldable chairs and tin shed roof and blinds on the windows. It is right next to the gurukul sports academy. Within 2 minutes after getting seated a man came to take the order and I ordered 1mixed paratha and 1 lassi. It was getting a bit hot inside and I was feeling the price is a bit more compared to the ambience of the place. But once the food was served I just gave up counting on the cons. The paratha was a very large one with a dullop of butter on top and dhania(coriander) chutney on the side. As I bit into the paratha it tasted heavenly. Just like the man who took the order had told it had very thick layer of aloo Gobi, onion, paneer and even tomato stuffing. It was one of the best parantha I had. I really don't mind paying 70 bucks for this. The lassi was also of a very thick consistency and was super delicious. It was such a satisfying breakfast! They do not start taking orders for lunch before 12: 30 as after the wonderful breakfast I was ready to parcel my lunch from here. It was the best breakfast I had since ages. Now I am ready to splurge on their veg meals now that I know the taste. Hope that will also amaze me. They are a little less on manpower still they are very courteous in attending everyone. A little renovation on the place and I would have given a full 5 rating.  After the wonderful breakfast went there another day for a lunch and took home the pander butter masala combo, nothing special about the roti but the aloo, paneer and rice were really good."
4.5,Nice veg food. Simple ambience and no extra tax. Quantity is also good. Overall it was a good experience being here. I would recommend this to others.
4.0,"What do I tell you about this place.Went there with my friends on saturday afternoon.Crowded place which spoke about itself(though difficult to find..its opposite gurukul academy).So coming onto food,it was one of the best punjabi food I had in bengalore.We ordered combo 2 (chole bhatura,raita,aloo jeera,lassi and kheer) ,combo 1(khachori,chole,aloo jeera,lassi,kheer)..and rajma combo.Everything was just perfect.I gave me a feel as if I am having chole bhature in delhi.:).Punjabi food lovers cant miss this place."
4.0,"I went here after reading the highly applauded reviews and a lot of good hearsay of this place. I happened to go there on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. We had to wait hardly for 5 mins till we got a table. The owner was very particular about the ones waiting to get a table. I had ordered Combo 5 which consisted of dal makhni, Matar pulao, Kadaai Paneer, Kheer, Lassi, Ghee fulka and masala papad. First we were served Lassi. OMG! It was the best Lassi I ever had in my life. It was made of the perfectly chilled curd. Very refreshing. A must try to whoever is going there. Then came the masala papad. It was the same usual which we have topped with veggie salad. The actual thali was served after about 20 mins I guess. It was so annoying to wait for so long. The Ghee fulkas won my heart. It was as if true Punjabi is serving food with no compromising on the amount of ghee served. The Kadaai Paneer , dal makhni and matar pulao were also yumm. The Kheer served in the end was good too. Over all a good eating experience.The place is a bit small judging it by the crowd which goes there. Even in hot summer days they had coolers and fans running.. I hope they expand their restuarant and work a bit on the interiors and increasing their staff. The service was extremely late. Maybe because we happened to be there on the wrong time of the day. The staff was humble enough to apologize for the delay.I found the price a little high according to the number of items they serve in a thali.Overall, good experience. but many points on which they need to work on."
4.0,"A must visit place for any veg foodie. It may not be classified as authentic Punjabi by some.....but  again, you can only get authentic Punjabi in Punjab.  Coming back, we visited the place for a team lunch on Friday. We ordered the lassi and buttermilk to drink. Both were appreciated by all, specially the flavor of the lassi was spot on. Dishes - Kadhai paneer, Rajma, Baigan bharta and Dal Makhni. The stand out feature, all the dishes and gravies had unique flavors, you could taste the difference, literally! The crisp parantha that we ordered was very good. So were the Roti's and the peas pulao. The only improvement area would be the service, we ordered the parantha initially and wanted to order additional Roti's later, as per requirement. But due to an influx of a big team , the service lacked that little extra. We had to wait a while to order the roti and the pulao. Overall - Excellent place, you can visit or recommend this place to anyone wishing to try Punjabi or North Indian food."
4.0,"This place reminds me of authentic North Indian Punjabi food. The food is a bit high priced but the ambience is good and five stars for the service. I visited this place on a Saturday evening, when it was kinda full but we got seats. The order arrived in 15 mins. The combos are perfect and yummy too, but the best items on menu are Lassi and Desserts. A must visit for North Indian Food Lover."
4.0,"I am sure the reviews are pouring and as far as I know all good ones. So is mine.  A lot of buzz about this one so had to try it. Went there on holi for lunch did not get a place,  went again for dinner and chose to wait.  Aloo paratha is delicious with the right amount of stuffing and spices. The lassi and chaas are really good, makes you feel at home( Home = Delhi for all delhites living in bangalore).  Paneer dishes are great  Had the assorted pakodas and they were good did not like the chutney though. The kheer which we got with one of the combos was delicious.  However on my second visit I did not like the parathas much.  Just hope they maintain the taste and consistency!"
3.5,"A famous North Indian joint. It fills up very quickly and they don't allow reservations. We had their aloo paratha, aloo pyaaz paratha and paneer paratha. Paneer paratha was really good. There was nothing very exceptional about the other parathas. I really loved how they served us with chaas and lassi. They are swift and cater very well. Definitely loads you up with surplus amounts in a low budget."
5.0,The lassi here is to Die for and so is everything else. The food is delicious and you can tell it is all freshly made. Please do try their Paneer Bhurji. The food makes the slight wait completely worth it. I would highly recommend this place and am definitely going back... Few times a week maybe ?... Exceptional hospitality... Big Thumbs Up!!
2.0,"Coming directly to food since there is nothing to talk about ambience.Ordered Lassi which was really tasty so my expectations about quality and taste of food increased while waiting for my starter which was panner pakora.it was crisp and hot and since panner is bland the panner didnt have any taste since it is not marinated or any spice added. It will be good if it was marinated in masala. Had thandai which was very tasty.for main course we had veg kadai, dal makhani, phulkas and aloo parata. The phulkas were good, dal makhani was ok not the best i have tasted.Kadai veg was a complete let down.Though the management claims they use fresh ingredients in some of their posts, i can bet the dish was stale.the beans were tasting bad.Aloo parata also was ok. Last was dessert called shahi tukda which was the worst.They had just put rabadi in a piece of bread and served.Normally the bread is shallow fried in butter then soaked in sugar syrup and on top will be rabadi.Over priced for the quality of food, taste and ambience. I seriously doubt zomatos rating system if this kind of food can get 4.2.I guess lot of reviews are fake to keep the rating high or people dont know what real good punjabi food tastes.overall very disappointing experience with both Kapoors cafe and zomato."
4.0,Good home made style food. The only problem is the food takes forever to come coz they cook on order only nothing is pre-cooked. However it's worth the wait. Must try chole bhature and lassi.
4.5,Need good punjabi veg food.. Rush to this place and grab your seat.. If you want to full your stomach it has best veg food near whitefield and kundanahalli.. Forget thali when you get the Punjabi dal tadka nad Shahi tudka which are awesome that I like.. Ambience is really cool.. Parathas with butter and lots of butter yummy.. If you are here think about taste.. Dont see the wallet :)
4.5,One of the best places to have a sunday morning north indian breakfast. Been there quite a few times and sunday starts on a delicious note at kapoor's
1.5,Terrible food ... Service poor .... Nothing like authentic punjabi dish..... Rating only for good lassi which i had.... There are other place in whitefield where u will get mouthwatering punjabi cuisine but seriously not this one...... Only the restaurant looks like a punjabi dhaba but nothing so great about the food....   Will not recommend to friends.....
4.0,Me and my husband visited this place for dinner. This place is dhaba-like! Taste and service was good. But we felt the usage of ghee and butter is high here!   Overall experince was nice and this place is pocket friendly. Will definitely visit there again.
4.0,"This place has a dhaba type ambiance. Chairs were little uncomfortable. We Had Malai kofta and Paneer lababdar with Phulkas ,Missing roti and Podina parantha ,Papad, Shahi tukda. Malai kofta and Paneer had really good gravies. Really loved the taste. Phulkas were also fine. Paudina Parantha had stuffing of lot of mint unlike I have had earlier have just a little bit sprinkled in form of powder, So I didn't like Paudina Parntha. Lassi was medicor. Should visit this place."
3.5,"Overall a good place to go for North Indian food in Whitefield area.  I tried aaloo paratha,  aalo Pyaaz paratha along with lassi which is served in a small pot.  Although 1 paratha is enough for a normal appetite.  Food overall good but not great."
5.0,"There is a Punjab in Bangalore and this is that place. A sophisticated dhaba with a heavy local flavor surrounding it .I have come here more than once and each time the experience has been getting better and better. Lip smacking food that can satiate any level of hunger in a matter of mins. If you are a foodie, do not miss the Double decker cheese paratha at any cost. What makes the experience more memorable is the people running this place .They take the definition of service and hospitality to a whole new level. If you are in Whitefield and you want to enjoy your breakfast or brunch, go to this place.Nowhere else."
4.5,"aloo parathas, authentic ones? this is the place you should crash into, they have got one of the friendliest staff i ever came across...! well i did not try anything else but the aloo parathas were out of the place, over priced yes but worth it.! :D"
3.5,"It was my first weekend in Banglore and I was craving for some good home like food after having rice variants and sambar for a week. One of our colleague suggested us about the cafe, so me and my friend decided to give it a try and to tell you, Kapoor's Cafe has a new patron.  Ambience : Very simple and basic.  Food: To start with we ordered Aloo paratha topped with loads of butter and pudina chutney. Up to the mark but curd was missing as a side.  For the mains, we had Gobi Masala and Phulkas, the gravy was excellent and phulkas straight from the tawa..what else to expect when you are away from home.  And the last but not least, Lassi in kulhad....perfect texture,acidity and sweetness. No malai though (should add it)  Service: Quick,considering the tables waiting for their food.  Pricing: Expensive considering the quantity  Note: If you plan to rush in peak hours, you might have to wait for the table.  Edit : Food quality here is of consistent. Visited many times after. Kudos"
5.0,"Don't, just don't care that it is a veg restaurant. It is a very sophisticated 'dhaba' with amazing people serving you some amazing Vegetarian dishes. Go for anything. And always have a kullad lassi alongside, that is if you like lassi.  Us two had one Cheese Paratha, one Chole Bhature, one Paneer Butter Masala Combo, green salad and lassi and cold-drinks. Yes, yes. You cannot, CANNOT stop eating here. IT'S that tasty. And all for just 500 bucks.  Service is definitely five-stars, but it might happen that you are staring at others' tables and crying inside.. But whatever you have ordered is going to be equally delicious.  It might feel a bit warm inside on a sunny afternoon, but the owners are installing another 3 coolers very soon.  Must-go."
5.0,"superb authentic punjabi food at a very reasonable price, n probably the only place in bangalore where u can eat nicely cooked Makki di rotti n sarso da Saag. Food is too good ?5 star well deserved"
4.5,"An experience delivered beyond expectations.  Tried the Kadia Paneer combo, Aloo Pyaz paratha, Mixed paratha, lassi andthe fruit cream. Each dish was made so well so as to give a homely feeling. Parathas tasty and dripping of butter as its preferred usually in the Punjabi way. Kadai Pander, unlike the common misconception of just another variant of Paneer Butter Masala, was great.  It tasted how it was meant to be. The lassis were so good I could just drink it as a substitute for an entire meal. Almost asked a friend to parcel it when he visited. The Kapoors cafe dessert special Fruit Cream is a must try also.  On the whole I left this place happy, with a full stomach and thinking 'What a Discovery has been made'. Have had simply great food, with great hospitality provided at a price which is still unbelievable. Looking forward for my next meal here.  Taste: 4.5/5 Quality: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 VFM: 5/5"
4.5,"Perfect.  Home away from home. Amidst the South Indian food in Bangalore, this place is like refreshing cool breeze. So much authentic North Indian food, chole rajma dal makhani paratha!!!! All with butter and the white makhan.  I died with happiness when I visited this place, such a nice homely place, authentic Punjabi food, great lassi in traditional kulhads, Punjabi music to add to it is being played in the background.  The food was mind blowing, the paratha was huge and it tasted so good!!  The thali had the lightest phulka ever, with paneer being soft and well seasoned.  The dal makhani was too good to be true.   In all, it's a must visit for everyone who misses that true North Indian food in Bangalore."
2.0,hhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....................................................................................................................
4.0,"The BEST service I have been witness to in a cafe. Run by a father-sun duo, this cafe is not much to look at, but you definitely shouldn't judge this book by it's cover. For north Indians craving makhan laden parathas, this is the place to be. But mind you, order just one piece of the stuffed paratha, because it'll keep you stuffed for the rest of the day. And buttermilk/lassi as an accompaniment always works! If nothing else, go to this place to meet the people who run this place. You'll feel like you're home. Courteous service would be an understatement. Cheers (with a glass of lassi)! :)"
4.0,Awesome hotel I have ever been.. Best for Punjabi sort of food.. I'm ready to die for the Lassi in this restaurant.. Really loved the way they served..
4.0,"Highly recommended , good food , well priced . Never new this place existed close to my house . Like all the other eateries which start of well and then dive down on quality . Hope that not the case here"
4.5,"If u're looking 4 some mouth-watering Punjabi food, there's no better place than Kapoor's cafe. I had been here on a Saturday night with a friend(on his recommendation) and simply loved the food they served. We ordered for punjabi style french fries, paneer pakoda,cheese paratha, ghee fulka, daal makhani, one paneer item and lassi n chaas..Loved d way they serve d lassi in earthen pots or kulhars.. Although it was packed to its capacity with people already waiting outside, still the service was quick enuf. The only suggestion I have is w.r.t to the ventillation.Since its a small place and the kitchen is adjacent, proper ventillation is required, otherwise everything's gr8 !!"
4.5,The wait for the food is worth it. The Khasta paratha with Baingan bharta with a lassi to begin with is all that you need to be on 7th heaven.
5.0,This. Is. Heaven.  FoodGasm at its best. Best Lassi. Best Parathas. Best service. Best people. You won't find anything like this ever. Go NOW !!
4.5,"Really nice, simple Punjabi food. Gives a very pleasant north Indian vibe.. Really friendly and hospitable staff. I enjoy every time I go there."
4.5,"On Saturday night I want to try some veg foods near by my home. So we searched abt this kapoor cafe in zomato and which had good rating. So went there by 9 pm with my roommate. It was full rush and we got waiting list card. We got the table after 15 to 20 mins.  Its medium size shop and it accomodate around 70 people at a time. We have ordered Gobi masala dry, Veg kadai and fulka at first. It took arnd ten mins to get our order. The food was fresh,hot and looks cachy. Gobi masala it was different and taste also good. Fulka is soft,hot and its tasty and its side dish veg kadai made it awesome.   Then we have ordered matar pulao, it came in sometime, it was fresh and hot. It was great dish, taste is awesome, me and my roommate i liked it a lot. I have never tasted matar pulao in this taste in surrounding place. Next we finished our dinner with awesome lassi. Overall we had awesome dinner, we have tried only few dishes now we will visit often to this place to try parathas, combos etc..  Ambience -3/5  Food Taste - 4.5/5  Quality - 4.5/5  Quantity - 4/5   I felt the rates of the food items is bit high since it is a small sized restaurant, but later i felt it was ok due to food quality and taste.   Overall it is very good North Indian Veg restaurant. If you are a lover of north indian dishes. You should visit this place once."
3.0,Veg paradise. Not recommended to dine in during summers n afternoons as the tin roof will cook to perfection just as the naans there. So take away would be best. Food is excellent no doubt about it. Owner n son are cool friendly ppl. Would recommend this place if u have a veg girlfriend.
5.0,One of the best places in Whitefield for North Indian cuisine. Really good service and nice location. Had a great dinner here on a drizzling Saturday. Must visit :)
4.5,"I hardly rate restaurants 4.5 but this one deserved it. The food here is just awesome. I had nothing so like North Indian in Bangalore ever. It has very simple interior and is clean. No parking problem also. The staff is too friendly, they actually take care of their customers. Also the service is pretty fast. This place would be famous for its parathas and lassi in near future for sure. Now coming to the prices, very reasonable and perfect.  The cooler, TV and old fashioned seating add the feeling of home to it. The gentry is also very good, mostly mid-aged IT professionals and friends circle. And above all when I visited here for the first time, I got to know I would be coming here again. Must be visited once for sure."
4.0,"After had a shopping with my friends, we planned to have a dinner when we came across the board ""Kapoor's Cafe"". At first, we were hesitating to get in since it is ""Purely Veg"" restaurant, and one of our friend suggested to try it out. But it was above our expectation, the taste of the food we ordered was so good. They provided a very good service too. It is a must try restaurant.  Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5"
4.5,If you just care about the taste and not the ambience then this is the place to be. Great service and authentic Punjabi taste. Do try the double cheese Paranthe and the lassi.
4.5,"The reason why Bangalore is known for its delicious food is because it has joints like kapoor's Cafe!  Indeed a pleasure it is to visit this place.  Yes, the food is a bang on! Also, the warmth of this Kapoor family makes it a worthwhile experience!"
4.5,"I will define the food here as ""Ghar ka Khana"" away from home. Simply delicious. Atmosphere is also lively. Everything we ordered was super yummy, be it baingan ka bharta or paneer bhurji or dal tadka or cheeeese parantha or even jeera rice. Would definitely love to come here soon."
2.0,If you are a person who has never had Punjabi food then you might call it a Punjabi eatery because they claim to be that.  The lassi and butter milk are overpriced yet lack the consistency and flavour that you would expect. All the food is just made spicy because they think Punjabi = spicy.  I am never going to go to this place again and if you wanna save some time and money I would recommend that you don't either.
4.0,Visited on last Sunday afternoon - it got full house after India batting got over during Indo-Pak WC  Smiling and hard working staff Great service though at times difficult to have immediate attention due to full house Ambience - they have kept it simple and it works Food - Good quantity and value for money. Remember to customize the spiciness else the regular seems bit hot  One suggestion - pls remove those plastic water jugs - doesn't look hygienic with previous customers touching it
1.0,Not maintained well... hygienic wise not good. We ordered Sarosa da saag n makki Di roti... no one from my family liked the taste. Over hyped.
4.5,This is the 1st time I have visited a only veg restaurant more than once . Good food. Friendly service. Adequate amount of butter served with parathas. :p
4.5,"OMG, what a place... Didn't expect this much yummy paranthas n lassi in Bangalore... Reached there just by chance, ambience wasn't looking that great, but was tired to go somewhere else, so sat... N to our surprise, it turned out to be yummiest... Yummiest paranthas n lassi I had so far in Bangalore .. Must try if u r north Indian."
4.5,"If you miss north indian food in Bangalore and is a fan of dhabbas, this is the place you should visit. Their special chandigarh bengan bhartha is to die for!! So is the aloo Gobi dry.  total veggie place. the ambiance is that of a much refined dhaba or cafe.  For the food I d go there again and again."
4.5,Oh my oh my oh my ! What a place ! Donot expect too much of an ambience but yes expect the best and freshest taste. The staff here is extremely friendly and they create a feel like home. I have been coming here since quite a while for my lunch and have tried most of the dishes. Trust me there is no dish that has disappointed me.   Please give it a shot and u'll fall in love with the food.
4.5,"We had dinner on Sunday with my father and college friend. It is a pure veg restaurant. We ordered paneer do payaza, mix daal. Food was very good, pure north india taste. They also serve chapatis, which were very soft. It was very economical and hospitality was superb. We ordered fruit cream in the end, was very tasty. I would recommend others to try food at least once at kapoor's cafe. You will love it."
4.5,"Amazing food!!! Amazing parathas!! The place is lil small so we had to wait for about 15-20mins on Sunday afternoon, but the food was worth the wait. Its a only Veg menu (hope they start NonVeg soon!!!)."
4.0,I had been to kapoor's with friends. Resturant ambience is decent(I liked the way it is).cool service.. As we are first time visitor to the restaurant they really helped to get the best food available there.
5.0,This is the best place for North Indian food in the town. Piping hot parathas with dalloo of butter on it. Khasta paratha is phenomenal. Lassi paneer pakoda saag kachori everything this has the real authentic taste. Not fancy looking place but who cares thing which should be best is food and this place is bang on target. Keep it up guys.
3.0,We visited here looking after zomato rating and we were not satisfied by their food Taste and u have to wait a bit more for ur order to be delivered on table ...
3.5,"Kapoor Cafe is a nice place which gives the feel of dhaba. We heard of this place before, so went to try the food there.  We place following order: 1. Aloo Paratha 2. Aloo Pyaaz Paratha 3. Punjab Dal Combo 4. Veg Kolhapuri  Both the Parathas were out of the world, simple with lots of butter on top. Veg Kolhapuri was also delicious.  But Punjab Dal Combo spoilt the complete mood of having food in Kapoor's Cafe. Aloo jeera was stale and smelling. We informed the concerned authority, he replied to get it checked and didn't come back.  Taste of food was good and service was also fine but unfortunately what happened to us insisted me to rate the dhaba to 3.5 stars."
4.5,"Came to this place after hearing from many that this is the new favorite Punjabi restaurant in Whitefield. And I must say, it is pretty good!  Ambiance first... There is none. If you're coming for a fancy place, this is the last place you should visit. But if you're looking to dig into your meal with both hands, this is the place. That said, I felt the prices were high for the ambiance & location.  Coming to the food, I would definitely recommend starting with a dry fruit lassi (loaded with nuts!). Among the parathas, the cheese paratha is as indulgent as it gets. All parathas are just loaded with butter - definitely not for the faint hearted! From the gravies - Paneer Degchi Delhiwale & Dhabe di dal. You can't go wrong with these. And the flavors of these 2 compliment the inexplicably abundant chillies in the parathas.  Finally, we tried all the 3 desserts they have. I would put them in this order of preference - shahi tukra, fruit cream & chawal di kheer. Actually you can give that last one a miss."
4.0,"For once, a place with so much hype on zomato didn't disappoint. The place is a little too small, and easy to miss, from the outside. But that's about the only negative thing I can think of. The food is good - a little too spicy for my taste buds, but makes it even better, when you wash it down with their lassi ! Assured foodgasms ! 4/5 from me !"
4.5,"This is the first place which comes to my mind when I think of spicy food. The food is delicious, Punjabi style & tastes like home. Best place for north Indians in Whitefield."
4.0,"Gravies are good in Kapoor's cafe but in few items they are folling customers. I did hear from so many friends that Lassi is really good and I would say no doubt it's good but if someone recommends to go for Dry Fruit Lassi then don't . The price they have set for dry fruit lassi is not equivalent of what you will pay. Suggestion would be, never dry fruit lassi except this all is good"
1.5,"I visited this place after a lot of buzz I heard from my friends last week. We were two families with 9 people in total. Kids enjoyed the french fries. First of all its a punjabi hotel without Tandoor was a big surprise. So, no naan or tandoor Roti there. But, strangely the paratha is also not up to the mark for a punjabi hotel. Its very thick. The paneer pakoda is just a fried panner in Besan without anything inside. My wife prepares a lot better than those. Please tasts sarso da saag. You will forget whatever good you ate in your life. It was a horrible dish. Only Dal was above average and veg kadai was better. For the ambience and seating, the less you talk is better. Except the people hailing from Punjab I dint find anything desi there. Still it is crowded everyday as there is no vegetarian hotel nearby. Poor Bangalooreans speciallay whitefieldiers have very less options. This place is really not competetive at all... All in all it was waste of time..."
3.0,"Kapoors cafe has been on my list for long and I finally made it here. We opted for the much recommended chaas, cheese parata , chole kachori and for dessert we went for the fruit cream on the owners recommendation. The chaas was really good and served in the authentic kulhad. The cheese paratha was really something with the right flavors of ghee, dollop of butter on top,cheese and green chilly,carrot,tomato stuffing. The mint chutney served with it was also complimenting. The Kachori was also well executed in terms of texture. This is the 1st time I had kachor in such texture and it felt just right.However, the ajwain in the kachori were a little too much and later gave me an acid reflux I just hope this was an exception and due to human error. Initially I was ok with the flavor but later on I really couldnt finish the kachoris. The chola was also well prepared with a good thick consistency gravy which was made right with no unnecesary garam masala to give you an acid reflux.  For the dessert we were bent towards the shahi tukra but went for the fruit cream on the owners recommendation that we wouldnt regret it. Here we were disappointed. The quantity is really less for 140 bucks and also we expected a thicker creamier version of accompaniment with the fruits. What we got instead was the consistency and flavor of melted icecream with fruits.   I really hope they increase their dessert menu with authentic desserts like carrot halwa, badam halwa which we would love to try. They also have good and affordable combo options.  Service is good.  Ambiance is good."
4.0,"A truly authentic Punjabi food experience.. Had the khasta paratha, phulkas lassi dal fry and paneer do pyaza ...had to wait a while before the food came..but the food was delicious..light on the stomach and light on the pocket.. Excellent choice if you wanna have some awesome Punjabi veg food.."
5.0,"Great place and food. No fuss about air condition or bottled water, cutlery or great ambience. Just good food. Pretty affordable. Wud love to be there again."
4.5,"Run away from any place in Bangalore that has a 'North Indian' tag to it. It should be reserved only for Kapoor's Cafe. All the flavour, taste and feel from those little dhabas dotting the highways in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi are capsuled into this small place, tucked away in a part of a city that people sometimes dread visiting. It's worth every penny and minute to get there and the food doesn't disappoint. It was my first visit and we ordered chai and masala papad at first. The chai, like all other drinks, are served in a kullad. Then we drived into the main course and the paneer do pyaza was one I had to order simply after reading raving reviews about it. It was absolutely delicious. The phulkas were properly pasted with ghee and the pudina khasta paratha was absolutely wonderful. The paneer degchi has become sort of specialty in the place and we were bound to order it. The sweet paneer that just melts away, along with the phulkas were a combination matched in heaven. And in case you are wondering why we just ordered veg food, it's because they only serve veg food. And all those meet lovers who swear not to set foot in an only veg restaurant, will be changing their wills and recommending Kapoor's cafe to fellow carnivores as well. One suggestion. Go empty stomach to this place, because you'll end up eating a lot more than you initially thought you could."
4.0,"Whitefielders behold ! there's an amazing authentic Punjabi cuisine restaurant hidden in the pocket of Whitefield. Now don't start judging the restaurant from the outside and let the food do the talking.  No fancy decor, no attractive location and no fancy smancy ambience ; kapoor cafe gives you a real surprise as soon as you step inside the place. The place is a very simple and humble layout but at the same time very clean and welcoming. We arrived at a good time because soon after we seated we could see people rushing in one after another.  We were attended by the manager (I think so) who was very kind and made our first experience here very special. He recommended the paneer do pyaza and the dal makhni along with phulkas. We also ordered a lassi which was so refreshing and so tasty, Im pretty sure I could of downed ten of those lassi drinks.  Coming to the food it was spectacular. I must say the highlight of the feast was the paneer do pyaza. The gravy was so tasty stirred with the right amount of flavours of Punjab. The paneer was so soft it literally melted in your mouth. I was excited about the dal makhni but sadly it didn't meet my expectation but it was still good. The phulkas are a simple dish but they were cooked perfectly.  Overall this is a place that is worth every penny and it give you an authentic experience accompanied by very friendly staff. Can't wait to tell my friends about it !!cya soon"
4.0,Awesome food:). Must try - Shahi tukra and paneer do pyaza. A bit expensive for certain items. Keep up the taste and your good nature. Should think about home delivery atleast in nearby areas.
5.0,"i am Regular Visitor to Kapoor's Cafe Not because of it's Near to My Apartment but Food Variety and Quality is very Good..!!

4.5,"Pretty good food at very good prices. The place is small and dhaba-like, the people there are nice and make it comfortable. No complaints. The combo meals are great value for money, with dal, paneer, 3 rotis, papad, lassi, raita and kheer, all for 300 rs. The lassi was nice and authentic punjabi. Would love to go again."
5.0,"I read about this place in zomato and went there and it is worth every praise it is getting. Awesome parathas, great hospitality and very affordable place. I have already been there twice in 2 weeks!!!"
4.0,"Kapoor's Cafe is the perfect place to eat out when you want your home-style food. Authentic North Indian is what they claim to serve, and they do indeed serve that.   We went there on a Sunday evening, around 830 pm and could get a table only at 930. That's the rush. They took our order while we waited outside for a table. That was a wise idea! Here's what we ordered: 1. A lot of phulkas. These were perfect. I'm so glad they serve such phulkas. I know this is a  very  basic dish but just the fact that we don't get this well made everywhere is what makes me so happy!  2. Dal Makhani : Super! A little spicy, well blended masala.   3. Paneer Dopyaza: I was so apprehensive about this dish, cause most of the places mess this up. But this place? Nailed it. This was our favourite dish.   4. Paneer Butter Masala: This was good too, just that the other dishes were better!  5. Buttermilk: SO refreshing! We all gulped this down. Cold, refreshing drink to go with our dinner.   We also packed few phulkas and a paneer dopyaza back home.  So, a filling and delicious dinner for five cost us Rs. 1050, which is VFM! I'd definitely recommend this outlet for people in and around this locality. I'm coming back to try the rest of the dishes                                             wordpress.com"
4.0,"Makar Sankranti brought with it a lovely, sunny afternoon and we decided to step out for lunch. My husband refused to go to MTR (Again! So soon?!!), and in a best of three, I pulled more short straws; and all said and done, we drove to Kapoors Caf Whitefield because hubby said Zomato has awesome reviews of it. Something you must know before you begin to read more about the place, because I dont want you thinking at the end of it all Huh! What do you know about saag? I am Punjabi, inside out, genes included. My name does not say it, but lets not go there, because the stuff is not complicated (thank goodness) but sure is a long story, and I save it for job interviews. It will suffice to say that I love my maah-chholiyan di daal as much as I love my tandoori chicken, that I love it when my saag has butter and saag in equal quantities, and that I curse in thet Punjabi. Oh, and I was born and brought up there. Now that that is out of the way, lets get on with the review. I loved the place when I stepped into it. Something about it stays with you; like how the well-mannered gentleman who comes to take your order is the co-owner, and has eyes that smile. How it is a family-run place, and they remember how old the restaurant is like a mom would know her babys age (5 months and 4 days). How little things are taken care of (We can make paranthas with no spice for the kids). How theyve done the interiors with their own hands. I do not expect all of this of a small easy-on-the-pocket place. But perhaps that is why it is a caf, and not a dhabha. It is decent food, inexpensive, served with panache. We loved our food (phulkas, dal, gobi ki sabzi), and our dessert (fruit cream, kheer), binged on the lassi, and left. To return within the next few days, with 13 more people. Suddenly, the caf looked small; but it was just a matter of perception, because they took us all in with open arms, and fed us well. With a smile.  Full marks for the paranthas, the phulkas, the daal, and the standard sabzi. Not so much for the saag and the makki paranthas, or for the bhaturas, which had too much khameer in them, or the shahi tukra. Super special recommendation for the paneer pakoras (take it from me, theyre good), the chutney that goes with them (Awesome!); and then of course, the lassi, cold, served in little earthen pots, and which you can glug down 20 of, on a hot summer day. And then the fruit cream, a house favorite. The place stays busy, and people are constantly in and out, so the food is always fresh, and is served hot. Not oily, not greasy. Not too salty. And the desserts are just the right amount of sweet. Besides, the service is quick, unless you order the saag and makki ke paranthe which usually take ages even when Mums making them. Also, clean, yes. I had thought it would cost over 5, but we paid 3.6K for the entire fauj. Id have liked to say I loved it again, but Ive said it before, so Ill stick to I shall go there again. Worth every penny in my pocket!"
4.5,Most authentic punjabi food in Bangalore. This place looks more like a dhaba than a cafe. Warm atmosphere inside with prompt hosts to take care of their patrons. However i would have loved to taste some non-veg dishes coming out from the same kitchen had there been an option.  Overall a great place....no bullshit...just awsome food!!!
4.5,This place had some great food and it  reminded me of an authentic restaurant from Punjab. Very nice set up. The lassi is a must try for all.
4.0,I and my wife visited this place on a sunday evening. its situated inside the  gurukul sports complex.it says here that its open by 6.30 but we had to wait till 7. the food offered is pretty good.we first had tea with panir pakora which was quite good. then I ordered sarso ka saag combo and my wife ordered kadhai paneer combo. The portion size is pretty good for the price. they assist very well in choosing the food. the ambiance is just ok but it feels cozy. overall its a must visit if you want good punjabi food at a reasonable price.
3.0,"Went to this place after reading rave reviews on zomato.. Not easy to find the place as its not on main road but with some research we were able to find it. It was Filled by IT folks , didnt found diff to find sitting place. They had saag n makki roti combo(seasonal) available, so out of 7 folks...5 opted for that... I think that was the mistake we did.. Saag-- it had more of palak than mustard.. No taste of garlic which adds to saags aroma n taste.. So i would rate saag as 2.5 only as being a delhite i know how saag is made and how it tastes. Makki ki roti--- it was of decent size, but makki ki roti shud hv some salt present it in... Which was missing... But white butter they provided was a great addition n we loved it.. Gur-- it adds to taste of saag/makki roti combination.. Bt it was out of stock ???? Some of the folks ordered paneer lababdaar--- taste was good bt portion size considering the prizing wasnt very great. Khasta parantha--- it was awesome.  So after just an avg experience with saag/makki roti combo.... I am planning to give one more try where in i will try parantha and some veggies.. Till then its just 3/5 rating.. Still Kesar tops my list of veggie food in whitefield area.."

It is a very decent food, tasty and ambiance is good. The only thing which bothers me is the service, we need to wait too long to get our order so certainly not the place you wanna visit when you are really really hungry."
5.0,Very good food. Quick and very courteous service. They should open a chain of restaurants ... Good to find a veg punjabi restaurant ..reasonable pricing....parking space....available ....
3.5,Another pocket friendly restaurant but its food makes it more markable when u talk about kapoor's cafe. Ambience is good but cutlery can be good.unfortunately the day me n my hubby visited KC we saw some dirty glasses and plates which made us little disappointed ????.
4.5,Let me begin by saying that it is really difficult to find a place like this in a city like bangalore. The food is really tasty. We tried the paratha combos and all of them really yummy.  The desserts were great too especially the shahi tukra is a must try. The owners investment in ambiance and cutlery  is basic but the place is really clean and the staff is very friendly.  The must visit for people looking for north indian food.
4.5,"The place might look deceptive by appearance, but excellent food and great value for money. This place is a no frills restaurant but the food is quite authentic.   This place is a must visit.  Ambiance: No Frills Food: 5 Service: 4.5 Value for Money: 5"
4.5,"Looking for a budget place close to office for our Friday lunch, me and my colleague zeroed in on kapoors cafe coz of the good rating and reviews on zomato and also coz of the fact that my colleague knew where this is located(in gurukul academy's compound).  As soon as u enter the compound one might be a little apprehensive about this place but once you get into this small but well maintained place your initial fears get buried. This place is run by Mr. Arpit Kapoor along with his brother( who are on their heels taking good care of the guests)and father! The menu is filled with authentic Punjabi food and they had just then started their winter offering 'sarson da saag' aur 'makki di roti'. We got the following items:  Maharaja Combo 7: This combo for Rs.299 is very good value for money. This combo is seasonal coz u get the sarson da saag, makki di roti. The authentic touch to this dish is added by 1-2 small pieces of gur(jaggery) which is to add a Lil flavor to the sarson da saag! Along with this you get masala papad( slightly spicy), chaas(buttermilk), sweet dish(kheer or shahi tukda). This was the first time I was having shahi tukda and I have fallen in love with this delicacy made out of bread!  Aloo pyaaz ke pakore- nothing very special about this tea time snack. Chaat masala sprinkled on top of the pakore added a tangy twist to this dish. Only problem I had with this dish was the excess oil dripping from the pakore!  Paneer labubdar- meaty, long chunks of paneer in a thick, creamy gravy this dish was on zomato in the must try section which is why we got this. Slightly sweet dish which works well with any kind of bread.  Khasta roti- have had this roti before but dint know it comprises layers and layers of bread! Again the authenticity of this place coming into picture! This is a wheat based bread which fills your stomach with just 1 piece.  Total bill came up to 670 for the 2 of us which can be considered to be budget pricing in today's scenario! Yummy authentic Punjabi food with great service from the owners themselves makes it a 'sone pe suhaga' kind of eating experience!"
4.0,Been to this place on Thursday night on 25th dec - stepped in around 8.30pm and by then the place was al full and crowded. we were welcomed by the staff and they made sure we got the table fro 4 of us on time. Was kinda skeptical about the ambiance - it was simple and rustic but was neat though. For starters we choose paneer ka pakoda - which was nice :) panner was soft and succulent and was fried with batter - :) yummy i would say For main course - We had a quick look at the menu and then ordered - paneer butter masalsa - butter n naan and then phulkas . Once i had the first bite i was like boy - had a chance to taste one of the finest paneer butter masala curry after a long time :D \m/ it s was indeed great . Then we decided to another curry and ordered the malai kofta - once we had it we al digged in and it was indeed another best preparations from the chef :D kudos and three cheers to them. Later we had ordered the paneer pulav which was made of ghee and it was yumm on the whole we were quite happy with the food :D it was indeed tasty :) bill came up to 800 rs for 4 of us which was reasonable :) The one lst good thing i would love to mention about them is the service it is apt and perfect :) they have that smile on their face and indeed they speak very sweetly or politely to their customers :) which is good way for all the restaurants :) Ambiance - 3/5 Food - 4.5 / 5 service - 4.5 /5 VFM - 4/5                                             krantiawelltravelledgourmand.wordpress.com
4.5,The best Punjabi food. Chole bature was the best made of fermented curds n not like poori seen in other places. Gobi n slop paratha was awesome. Be careful if Ur tooooo conscious abt Ur weight girls!!! They use a lot of oil. Masala Papad was really nice. Had in many places but felt this was best. Ambience is a bit of prob here. If u can adjust Thn it's best place for u at reasonable rate Best part r combos which r very comfortable to decide on wit Wat u wanna eat. Staff Ter takes really good care of u It's like being at home wit tat food if Ur a north indian
4.5,The only proper and delicious food we have once in a week is at Kapoor's cafe. They serve Authentic north indian food at affordable rates and freshly started is the seasonal sarso ka saag n makke di rotti is just awesome. Must haves are the sweet lassi and chaas served in kullads over here which are simply soul soothing. Service is very good as the owners themselves interact with customers.
5.0,"Food is super yum! I ate sarso ka sag and makki ki roti and it was divine, also had paneer lababdar which was delicious. Owners are very good to talk to and warm. The service was exceptional. It was their closing time but they still accommodated me and a friend of mine and did whatever they could to delight us. Enough quantity and very well priced."
4.5,"I am a pure non-vegetarian and I never understood ""good veg food"" till the time I visited Kapoor's cafe.  A friend came  to meet me and it was his idea to go there. I was little apprehensive and not very hungry too. But what I discovered was a steal..indeed!  A tiny cefe full of people and that was the first glance I had and I was pretty sure that it was going to be a good experience.  We ordered chaas, sweet lassi, cheez paratha, missi roti and phool gobi masala.  All of them were simply lip-smacking and the not-so-hungry me ended up eating a LOT!  The cafe had a very youthful feel . The uncle at the billing counter was very polite and gentle and he wished everyone for a great new year. The stuff were also cooperative, quick and well aware of what they served! And last but not the least, the prices..it was absolutely pocket friendly for such amazing food that they served!  A great vegetarian joint for all North-Indian food lovers who miss their home-made food.  A must visit :)"
3.5,"Located near the gurukul sports academy on varthur main road. When you enter you will be greeted by a very courteous staff. Keep in mind this place is pure VEG. The ambience is pretty plain and simple. But the due to its proximity to the sports complex.. Its pretty much full all the time.  Coming to the food...  Must order: Lassi (heavenly!), and cheese paratha (you'll forget your cheese burst pizzas after this).  Also worth Mentioning: chole bhature, Rajma combo."
4.5,Delicious parathas and lassi... Love this place.. The food never disappoints you .. Typically generous punjabi khatirdari..do pay a visit...
4.0,"Great place with amazing service, the family trio are really great and gives us a great experience with the food too. Lassi and daal is a must to have with the food."
4.5,"Year 2015 starts with a bang. Sunday breakfast at Kapoor's Cafe with friends. Reached there @ 9:40 but the restaurant was not functional yet. Tried four types of parotha. Onion, paneer, mixed and double cheese. Top one - Double cheese parotha. Must try. Tried Kachori Chole and it was awesome. Lassi in kullad was good. Kullad Coffee is very nice and is a must try for coffee lovers who hate the capuchinos and lattes. Value for money."
4.0,"I am rating a 4 out of 5 because after my visit today, i honestly felt they are capable of great progress and the place is brimming with professionalism and talent. I see a 5/5 rating on the horizon for sure :)  4/5 for taste 3.5/5 for ambiance (Just for the congested space and the small CHAIRS) 4/5 for service 4/5 for value for money  We'd ordered a rajma combo, shahi pulao, assorted pakoras and a cheese paratha with spicy curd.. The rajma combo was fulfilling but my sister thinks that the quantity could be more for the price. My shahi pulao was delicious but oily, and i really hope they serve a side dish along with it considering the 200rs price tag. But the pakoras and the paratha my friend had ordered were just blissful and he relished it until the end.  We loved the masala that was sprinkled on the curd and the pakoras.  I definitely will visit the venue in a week.. ENJOY THE IMAGES :)                                                                 instagram.com"
4.5,If you want to understand how goood this place is ... try getting a table on sunday evening... its full week after week ... Great food ... Great price ... Happy me ...!!!
3.0,"All the reviews and great ratings made me visit this place for breakfast. I was however not very charmed by the food. Paneer pakoda was nice. We ordered aloo paratha and mixed paratha. The stuffing in both of these were quite flat in taste and lacked spices. However, the quality of food was good and the paratha was filling. I would have liked a more tangy taste."
3.5,Hello frnds I visited the place for dinner .. first of all i want to mention abt owner behaviour is superb ..he is taking live feedback and make the changes according to that.. food is serving hot . Ambience 3.5/5 Food 4/5 Service 4/5
5.0,"Excellent food - friendly, prompt service, and low prices. One couldn't ask for much more, really. Except maybe for some slight improvement in the decor. But there's probably not much room for fanciness at these prices."
4.0,"Nice cosy place for vegetarian food.  North Indian is what you get here and yes it's very tasty.  It's a small place and hence you should expect a bit of a waiting here and the service might be slow sometimes but past all that.. the food is delicious.  Recommended for a great, friendly on the wallet dinner."
4.0,If you are vegetarian then this is a nice restaurant for having North Indian Veg food. Dry fruit Lassi is nice... Location is a bit tricky to find for the first timers.. If you know Gurukul then its fine..
4.5,"This review comes after my today's visit to the Kapoor's cafe for a team lunch alongwith my colleagues. Very nice vegetarian punjabi cuisine! Their parathas are very nice.  We ordered aloo paratha, aloo-onion paratha and double cheese paratha. The cheese parantha was just awsummmm.....The lassi and buttermilk were average. We ordered for a couple of masala papads which were hot enough to get smoke blowing out from your ears.  The chola-bhatura's were nice and enough to satisfy a big appetite like mine.  Overall a nice experience, the only issue would be to find this place for the first-timers."
4.0,Me and my friend had dinner here. Food is OSM. Service is also good. They managed very well in a small place. You can go with your friends or family as well. Good place in whitefield.
4.0,"Missing north Indian food... Missing the spice... Missing the sweet lassi and staff paratha. Kapoor's will serve you tasty north indian food... People have already said a lot about this place about it food, service, etc.  Location will be a big challenge for someone who is visiting for the first time.  Go with you friends and family and enjoy the food."
3.5,Being a non vegetarian and going for a pure Punjabi veg hotel and giving it a 4star is really a big thing for me. I loved the richness in the food it fulfill my appetite. Its worth going many more times. Liked the full meals and a simple recipe to taste with greatness.
4.0,"Went to this place for lunch with my wife today. A lone little shack with all the simplicity of a village dhaba that is run by two very pleasant and efficient young men. The food is served piping hot and there is an authenticity and to the taste that only few restaurants offer today.  Their cheese paratha is really yummy, a must try. I haven't seen many places in Bangalore who serve their rotis with dollops of butter or their desserts with generous sprinklings of dry fruit as this one.  A meal for 2 here will cost you approximately Rs. 850-900. This place deserves full marks for taste and quality of food as well as for efficiency of service. Perhaps minor improvements like slightly better chairs or an extra hand wash basin for more convenience? Or maybe some authentic dhaba music playing for some added nativity? Not too much to ask for their price range. :)  And oh yes, please do keep up the same quality and taste of food."
4.5,"This place deserves all stars on food, pricing, service and ambience. The staff are courteous, the gentleman who takes orders (I suspect he's the owner/partner as well) is polite, fast and very courteous. The matka chaas is fab and for a light eater like me a single paratha was generous - with a copious dollop of butter. Honestly, nothing to whine about, if at all one thing I would like that would have given this place a 5/5 would be if they served the food from some non plastic plates staying totally authentic :)"
4.0,A very good startup by the family. among very few places who serve wheat parathas :).. I have been there almost 5 times and loved the food.  Must Try: 1. Double Cheese Paratha 2. Chilly Khasta Paratha  Should try: 1. Makke ki roti and Sarso ka saag 2. Alu paratha 3. Kheer  Can try: 1. Paneer lababdaar 2. Rajma combo  Avoid: 1. Using Toilet 2. Raita  PS: ensure you take some snacks with you as this place is overcrowded and it may take 45 mins of waiting time( on weekend dinner) . :) to just get the table.
4.5,Really good ambience - love the set up and the interiors. Great staff - courteous and diligent. And great food - gives you a warm and happy vibe while eating. Would definitely visit again.
4.0,Food is good and worth the price. Ambience is not very good and the service time is also more. Khasta parathas and various combos is a must try here.
4.0,"This review comes 2 visits later to the Kapoor's  cafe. Very nice vegetarian punjabi  khana! Their parathas  are very nice. In this eat - out we ordered the aloo  paratha  and cheese paratha. Since we had our little daughter with us who was going to eat the paratha, the gentleman who took our ordered suggested that he would get the parathas without chilli. Initially I was wondering how would that be for us to taste  ... but believe me it was truly tasty! I didn't miss the chilli at all. The cheese parathas was awesome and highly recommend but it will just fill you up!! And for cheese lovers like my hubby and me and my daughter we don't complain!! The lassi  is a must have. Thru our meal we ordered some 9 lassis  of which we took some home parcelled for my folks and they loved it!.  Hubby also ordered the veg meal option which had rajma, chawal, aloo jeera  dry veggie and phulkas. Again not all at disappointed. Hubby being a rajma fan was happy and I loved the aloo jeera! We had no room for desserts! Next time I am definitely looking forward to try the sarsoon  da saag! A no fuss ambience but the service we got was so warm and friendly!  Waiting for my next visit!"
4.5,"Had perfect authentic punjabi veg lunch after long time... heard good positive reviews in zomato and was planning from couple of weeks for this place.. able to visit today but definitely will plan to visit again n again whenever i feel to taste good veg punjabi food.  Food, staff & service was simply awesome so don't go with ambiance and delay in reaching food on the table..  We started with Paneer Paratha for kid and we were eager to finish it before kid as it was really yumm :) I have to try their other paratha's in next visit. We ordered Paneer Lababdar, Sarso da saag (seasonal & it is available now) with makke da paratha, khasta paratha and ghee fulka. It was really awesome items to have any time and kind of perfect for us. Subji quantity is too heavy for two people... two veg dishes can fit for 4 people easily. and lassi... uumm.. recommend to start with this and end with this :-P Shahi Tukra could have been little better.. not sure if that's how it is. usually we like deep frying the bread in ghee but this was little different..  In overall, we had memorable Punjabi cuisine and totally worth it.."
4.0,Nice food. Mediocre service. Cozy Place. Will visit again. I wish the food was a bit less spicy. The place is well knit. They should increase the staff to provide better services.
4.0,"Been here for the first time for a breakfast on a Christmas Day .. Having been stayed in Bangalore for more than 6 years n nt finding even a single joint which serves good North Indian breakfast . But nw after visiting kapoor 's cafe , I can proudly say that Bangalore has one awesome place for pure punjabi style breakfast.. Keep it up Arpit n all the very best ????????"
4.5,"After going through lot of good reviews on Facebook as well as zomato , thought of giving it a try today.. We visited this place for breakfast early morning on the day of Christmas.. We reached there sharp at 10 am .. The cafe was just opened. N within no time , our food was served hot n fresh . The owner of the cafe was very courteous n he made sure food was served on time , hot n fresh .. I must say it is one of the best places to visit if u r looking for north Indian pure Punjabi breakfast ..Their kachoris are amazing . But I wish they opened little more early so that we can enjoy breakfast early morning..  P.S. Your jalebis are eagerly waited... ;)"
4.0,"The yummiest punjabi veg food i have eaten to date! Fresh,hot & yummy! The dal makhani was to die for ! The great food was accompanied by quick service & the nicest hosts/owners! Thank you for the great food! :)  Definitely going back!"
4.0,"For Kapoor's Cafe the hindi proverb ""bagal men chora, sheher men dhindhora"" goes perfectly fine. I have been living at a stone's throw distance from this restaurant since past 3 months but came to know about it only last month.  I must say it is a wonderful ""discovery"". It is a small, family-run restaurant inside the Gurukul Academy compound.  The food is here is typical Punjabi style(spicy). Here are some of the items I like the most here:  1.Cheese Parantha  2.Kachori aloo  3.Chaas  4.Fulkas(they are so  light)  The only thing bad about them is that during weekends your order might take 30-40 min to get served.  Overall , if one wants to have a sumptuous lunch/dinner at a reasonable price, Kapoor's is the place."
4.5,"I had heard a lot about this place from friends and BFC so finally decided to check it out. yday for lunch. We had ordered sarson ka saag, roti, and a combo with paneer It was served really fast Ambiance was good and lively and the staff was really friendly! If you're looking for simple and homely north indian food this is it.. Finally found a place near Whitefield/Brookefield which servers authentic Punjabi food...Next week planning for Breakfast with kiddo.."
3.5,Authentic North Indian cuisines but incredibly expensive.. It soothes your taste buds but burn your pocket. Some items are priced absolutely illogically.. Must go if u love North Indian and foodie enough. Stay away from any drinks as the price makes no sense
3.5,"I had heard a lot about this place from friends so finally decided to check it out. We had ordered cheese, paneer and aloo parathas. It was served in around 30-min. The cheese paratha was delicious but the rest two were okaish and nothing extra-ordinary. A must try is their lassi. Ambiance was good and lively and the staff was really friendly! Recommended if you're looking for simple and homely north indian food."
4.0,"A place for Casual dining and to fill yourself up, it's a Dhaba not a Cafe as us Indians understand. Portions are large, price reasonable. Dhaba Dal has that lovely mild smoke flavour and is thick. Khasta Paratha is large, layered, surprisingly loaded with ajwain, and is soft but not Khasta (Crumbling). Missi Roti is a confused mix of Missi (besan mixed) and Khamiri (Fermented dough), I would avoid in future. Paneer Lababdar and super chilled butter milk are great."
4.5,"I fail to accept that I did not spot this establishment earlier. A friend took 2 of us out for dinner last Thursday, and I must admit, I was a bit astonished when he picked this place, but it was a brilliant pick.  Absolutely smashing food. We didn't order anything extra, but literally everything we ate was delicious from the chole to the paneer butter masala & the sarson ka saag! Fabulous! I couldn't get enough of the lassi, so I repeatedly requested for more.   True Punjabi food, and authentic flavours. Leaves the perfect ""spice"" aftertaste in your mouth, which is enjoyable, and is always cooled down by the lassi. We need more places in Bengaluru like this."
4.5,Sunday's brunches become awesome when places like this serve you with amazing food. The dishes remind you of your homes Sunday spl breakfast. Do go and have great food coz you don't want to miss out on a place like this. Ideal for bachelors living close by for sumptuous meals through out the day.
4.5,It feels like home here. More than the food it's their core  values and principles which they diligently work on maintaining.  I have been here quite a number of times now and anything you taste (A long list if I start writing) has a true punjabi flavor to it. Again I would say it has so much more to it along  with the tasty food.
4.5,Sunday morning we woke up in the mood for some good old north Indian breakfast. A short search on Zomato led us to Kapoor's Cafe. It is a little difficult to locate. Ambience will remind you of a Dhaba complete with Bollywood music. We started with Kachori Aloo and Chole  Bhature. They were over even before we realized! Literally ungli chaat  rahe the sab. The lassi was also amazing with the right amount of sweetness. Want to come back soon for Sarson saag and makke  ki  roti.
4.5,"A homely place to be in. A great gesture from the owner who is , for the most reason, a delhite. So expected. You taste buds will feel awesome after having ""Sarsoo da saag"" and Makhi di roti. To add with it we got complimentary ""guud"" too. So overall a great first experience. If you want to feel the north touch ,better try once.Later i needn't ask you again. "" Thumbs up !"
4.0,Kapoor's cafe!! This place will surely compel you to consider Punjabi food.  Every single food we tried was good. Puri and kachori combo was brilliant...taste like Ghar ka khana. Overall a nice experience and would recommend to try.
5.0,great place for Punjabi/ North India food. Best Sweat Lassi in Bangalore . Owners give a personal touch to make customers comfortable. Economical but neat and clean place with good functional setup.
2.5,A casual place to snack up with friends. Prices are a bit on higher side as compared to the setup and food preparations and quality.  It is run by a family together. The lady takes the kitchen and the man takes care of the bill payments. Their two sons take the orders as well as serve the food.  Service is slow as they don't have many helpers and even orders get mixed up sometimes.
4.5,"Had read so much about this place and hence decided to go on a Saturday for dinner.. Well, my first advice, go on a weekday because on a weekend, there is a huge waiting! But the wait is totally worth it! We had to wait for almost 45 mins to get our seats which are not very comfortable. It is basically a tiny cafe with no frills run by one family! The food, right from the starters which included paneer pakoras, masala papas etc., to drinks including buttermilk n lassi, to main course (matar paneer, daal, missi roti, plain paratha, 4 layered parathas) was sumptuous: each bite reminds you of home food!  So, it is safely one of the best authentic Punjabi places out there... and at the price that they charge for it? Totally worth it!"
5.0,Me and Wifee been to this place twice in last 2 weeks. This review will be based on the same. The Paranthas are the best and authentic. I can tell from my experience from living at many places  in Punjab and North India. The dry fruit lassi is awesome and is served in small matkas.. Earthen pots.. Pls try the Paranthas with white butter like asli Punjabi do.. Kapoor uncle and Harpreet made us comfortable.. Very lively and courteous.. Changa ji..
4.5,Naice place!!!!awesome food!!! But.......we had to wait for an hour for our order. And no proper waiters or service provided. Must go once and when u want authentic Punjabi food....:)
5.0,Amazing place !! Authentic Punjabi food :) We ordered maharaja thali and parathas..the lassi and dal makahni were awesome :D A must try I will say :)
3.5,"Good homely food priced just right. Their combos are fulling and value for money. Cheese paratha and lassi should be on everybody's must eat list here. The pudina and chili layered parathas are unique, and equally good.  The owner is friendly and gives enough attention to every table, taking time to explain the menu. They are kid friendly too and understand the tantrums of kids and ensured the kids were served first, brownie points for that. Which reminds me of the only sour point of the otherwise delightful experience - desserts. We tried the shahi tukda, but had to leave it unfinished!! It was hard to even bite, and undeserving to be on their menu with the likes of cheese paratha :)"
4.0,"Been here a couple of times since I recently discovered. What makes me go there again and again? Taste of home cooked food. The ambiance as well as the food really brings out the feel of home. I totally understand that it is a family run restaurant and management is not upto the mark. But with a lot of word of mouth publicity this place is getting popular and they better plan the customers better. This is the only place in Whitefield (at least) where they serve rotis as per need. If there are two people they'll serve 2 rotis first and then bring another two when finish the first serving. This is really a pleases me as I get to have Hot rotis as it comes. Must Try Cheese Paratha. Something different and innovative. Other than that, try anything that would remind you of home. Definitely on my repeat list."
5.0,It was a good experience being there...lovely food with lot of affection. Lassi was awesome!! One must try lassi.  Ambience not so good but food was nice...only wheat parathaas were there..no naan.
2.5,Parothas plus lassi is good. Do try double cheese parathas without any miss.Chairs can be changed for better comfortably to seat and enjoy food!!
3.5,Play play and then settle down here for a good dinner.... Parathas are really very tasty and will be really mouthwatering.... Its always crowded.. So make sure you reach in time to find a place there...
3.5,"Had heard a lot about this place from Abhishek Gupta and so I went to Kapoor's on my birthday for a lavish punjabi dinner. I had not eaten something authentically punjabi eversince I moved out of Delhi and was looking for such a place in Bangalore, and I finally found one! Amazing food these guys serve. Apart from good taste, they have taken care of cleanliness at the place, which is more important for me than the taste. I would highly recommend going to this place for a punjabi cuisine.  But I was disappointed by the dessert (fruit cream, in particular) which they insisted us to have. The cream was not smooth as it is supposed to be, but was a bit curdled. Had the fruit cream been a bit smooth, it would have been a perfect dinner for me on my birthday."
2.0,I went on a sunday morning with my friends after  hearing some good reviews from some of my friends and seeing the ratings on zomato   Parathas were ok as far as Taste is concerned presentation of the food was good  Asked for tea which was not available as staff was making Excuse for the lunch time  Ordered Puri chole and there i made a mistake as it was not at all good Puri was not fried at all and was very hard Still managed To eat 1 puri as i dont like wasting food
5.0,"Small and cozy. Typical Punjabi cuisine.. Excellent food and service! Kachori chole and lassi is a must try! Value for money guaranteed. This is one of the rarest places where you order anything and rest assured, it tastes good!!"
4.5,A splendid place to have some north indian food.. From a delhite family...  With some pyaar ka chutney and kushi ka lassi.  I loved the environment.. And most of all the guys over there... Love to be many more in your cafe... Kabhi alwida naa kehna!
5.0,"Went to this place for dinner.. Had nothing specific in mind and randomly selected this from zomato It turned out to be perfect, both with taste and cost effectiveness. Food was very well cooked and taste was relishing.  From starters, to main course and desert, everything was good. Do visit this place if you are looking for some delicious north Indian food."
3.5,"Entering the place fills you with lot of great energy. The owners, father n son duo are very congenial and the kapoors provide good service. We ordered a veg khdhai combo, paneer butter masala combo and  chole bhature. The food is made with the right amount of oil and spice level and will remind you of home. Definitely a place worth a second visit!"
4.0,This place is what we have been missing for a long time at Whitefield - a small eatery with a decent crowd serving fresh tasty food at price points that don't bite the wallet. We've been here twice and liked the food both times. The combos are value for money and the lassi is something that is not to be missed. The phulkas are fluffy and light but I didn't like the pudina paratha a lot. The cheese paratha is simply out of the world and a treat for cheese lovers. It does take a bit of time for the order to be taken and for the food to come in but the food is worth the wait..Service is courteous and the owner is present at the place most of the time.A good place for days when you crave good food minus the frills.
4.5,"Good food , good service, value for money...must try for a gud north indian food..which u hardly get in bangalore...it was recommended by a friend ..the ambience is ok however gud food fills that drawback..Overall nice and hygenic place .."
4.0,"People who give preference to the tastebuds than ambiance will definitely find it worth going place. I went with my team and had all sorts of Paranthas with chaach and lassi. They were really awesome. Their Poori sabzi, kheer and fruit cream were good as well. Prices were reasonable as well."
4.5,"Pros: Run by a family, hence the taste is homely and safe for your stomach. The snacks, especially pakoras are awesome. All the paneer curries are very soft and tasty. My personal favorite baingan ka bharta (smoked brinjal egglplant curry) and Onion-aloo pakora are must tries.  Cons:  There is a huge rush on saturdays and sundays. You just have to keep waiting to get your table. They need to add more cooks. You need to inform beforehand to make the curries less spicy, especially Paneer butter masala I found to be spicy"
4.0,"I, for one, surely stand up for the small scale eateries which never compromise on quality and hygiene. My visit to this place comes at the behest of couple of recommendations and excessive good reviews in Zomato. Being in my wishlist for a while, finally I made it for a dinner. Finding out this jewel was not a big deal since their board gets everyone's attention. Yes, I would say that the ambience is mediocre but hey, don't judge the place already. Their food will speak for that. The starter, Paneer Pakora had this perfect seasoning. It was served with green chutney and the quantity was quite filling(8 pieces). For the main, we ordered for Pulkas and Paneer Lababdar. The former was perfectly made whereas the latter was utterly delightful with the spices hitting your taste buds. It was just delicious, I say. Then we have ordered for Combo 2 which includes Chole Bature, Kheer, Boondhi Raita and Lassi. The Bature portions weren't skimpy, that I hardly could complete eating it. Boondhi Raita and Chole was good as well. Oh the Lassi, I couldn't get enough of it. Rice ki Kheer, which I saved for dessert, was yummier! And all these costed us very less, that I saved the rest to buy their place( Just kidding, I cannot even afford a chair!). Overall, I promised myself that I'm going to eat only from this place when I'm around Thubarahalli and did it tell you something already?."
4.5,"Well any restaurant is rated on its taste, hospitality and ambiance Kapoor's cafe is bang on first 2 attributes but when you have such authentic flavors the ambiance becomes irrelevant, the ambiance too is not bad but if it was Kapoor's Dhaba instead of cafe the name would've justified the ambiance too but nevertheless that was too trivial. Coming on to taste, Kapoor's cafe comes up with authentic flavors with no fancy restaurant like rich and over acidic flavors giving a balance to your mouth as well as tummy, as I said they are bang on taste. Now hospitality, the cutie uncle and his family are best at it, they wont let you feel the absence of your mom while serving. All in all a must visit place atleast once in a fortnight."
4.5,"Must Try- Fruit Cream(5 of us had 8 portions of it :p ),Punjabi French Fries and Kachori chole/Kachori Aloo. Food- True to its name- ""Punjabi cuisine Restaurant"". Everything they serve here from Lassi to punjabi french fries( :D,Yes!) to pakore to main course to desserts were finger liking delicious. Every dish had a precise flavor, which I see missing in lot of other self-proclaimed ""Punjabi cuisine"" restaurants as I have tasted a lot of blatantly boring and bland dal makhnis,dal tadkas etc earlier and having dinner @ Kapoor's cafe where Kapoor Uncle and his son(I am assuming) serve you in a very homely manner.  Service- Although the place was packed when we reached there and had to wait for 10-15 mins to grab a table, but the service was actually very good and dishes usually arrived after 7-10 mins of placing our order, considering that this place was jam-packed.  Ambiance-This is the only area where I feel the cafe has to improve and hence, I have rated this place 4.5. The table and chairs were not comfortable and there was not ample space to eat and sit comfortably.  In nutshell,a definite visit for all the Punjabis out there searching for Fulka utterly dipped in desi ghee! :D"
3.5,"A simple cafe on varthur road and a lot of hype about it. Well I did want to try it out. Kapoor's cafe did justice in terms of food quality and taste - no doubt and it is worth what you pay for.   The cafe is run by a family - a very talented chef mom with a courteous dad and son running the cafe. While the service is good because of that, it also has its own disadvantage - they are finding it difficult to cater to everyone with the same care and speed, esp for the incoming crowd on a weekend. Ambiance and food override this issue. Creative and well optimized seating arrangement in a cozy shelter. More crew would definitely help though. The ""loading...please wait"" poster outside kitchen was intuitive.  Going over to what I had. After reviews on zomato, we felt we needed to try them all at once. We asked for pander pakoras, i ordered a combo 5 and my friend ordered a combo 3. Combos are well designed and the 2 we ordered helped us get to taste almost everything good on the menu. Ghee phulkas with deal makhni and shahi pander was exhuberant. Aloo pyaaz and Gobi paratha were good too - not the best though. The combos are offered with a dessertmade of kheer and rusk - loved it. But the salted cashews in the sweet made the sweetness mild. Just fried cashews would have done the job.   But ghee phulka was excessively ghee-ish. And the parathas were offered with an unasked dale of butter. Asking for preference might have helped - especially for people like me who are working on a diet ;-).   The lassi and chass we had to accompany our meal was an bonus. All-in-all it was a diary delight worth waiting for. (I had to wait 40mins to get my food served)"
4.5,Awesome food.. It just reminded me of a cozy dhaba out there in north.. With a very friendly and humble hosts .. Fruit cream is a must try.. U need to have it at least once ..
3.5,A bit hyped up and overly priced!! Too expensive for a Dhaba. Food is good but definitely not worth 4.3 rating. The owners are good and courteous. There fruit cream is good.
4.5,If you are looking for the punjabi dhabe vala flavour then this is the place.....loved it....dal tadka was awesome.... N chai was mast.......
4.5,"Very tasty homely food, excellent service, very pleasant experience. The owners are very courteous. Would certainly recommend Kapoor's Cafe :-)"
4.0,"Majestic.. Delightful.. Content.. This is exactly how I would describe my experience at kapoor's cafe. If you crib for Punjabi food & like masaledar, chatakdar food..oh sure do make a footfall here. We had heard about this place and found it too crowded for our liking in weekends hence we made a second dash on a weekday and rightly so...  These guys would make you swear with the likes of their curries & fulka which would authentically classify for Punjabi food.  We had Delhi degchi which was suggested to us by the person taking order as the especiality of Kapoors. We took Aloo gobhi dry to make a dry-curry dish combo.  It was very astonishing to see all elliptical air filled fulkas coming in as they used to ( its been ages since I had seen these ).  Lassi is a must have if you come down here. On the ambience front this would characterize under the age old family restaurants that used to be many years ago.. Small & crowded. PS: The manager here is seriously concerned about the quality he serves. Company : Shagufta Jain"
5.0,The food leaves you craving for more...makes to visit again and again! The look of the place might make one think twice...but no!..this food speaks volumes for itself. Must place to visit cause the out there the food just makes one happy...ehat else does a man need!
2.5,"Updating my review here based on my more recent visits. The place has lost its touch. Veggies specially the paneer ones are watery. Service taken a hit and due to the crowd and long waiting time just standing, it no more features in my go to place.    Old review - Had awesome food. Came to know about this place through zomato. Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. And I must say I do not regret it. Found a place where I can have food often. And since this is a veg place it is better suited to us. Ordered lassi paneer pakora fries and one of their paratha combos. Both paneer and cheese parathas were good. Pakoras were decent. I liked buttermilk and lassi a lot. Neither too thick nor watery. Had shahi tukda for sweets. Not bad but nothing great about it. Boondi raita could be improved. Found it slightly watery. Also would suggest them to serve some gravy along with parathas. A simple tomato onion veggi would be great. Overall wonderful place to have quality veg food without burning a hole in your pocket; that's rare in Bangalore!????"
5.0,"Really awesome food, great ambience and fantastic service. Tandoor for bread is not required, phulkas and parathas are more than what one can expect..... Paneer degchi delhiwale is mouthwatering dish...do try it. Waiting time is more after 8:30 pm specially during weekends."
4.5,"After a reco from a colleague, visited Kapoor's Cafe today for lunch and boy am I glad we did.  The place per say is small with no frilly setting but the food here is really the king. We ordered a Paneer  Lababdar , Daal Makhani and phulkas and a pudina khasta paratha. The Paneer  was spicy but really flavourful. The daal was nice too. A special word for the phulkas which were plump and light and the paratha which was the best I have had in years. Layered, crisp on outside, soft on inside and wonderfully flavoured with mint. The food quantity is generous which means we ended up parcelling both the daal and the Paneer .We finished our meal with the chawal ki kheer which was delicious , filled to the brim with assorted dry fruits. Satisfied to the core with the hearty meal there was nothing left to do than go home n nap for hours. Next time going to try out the parathas and lassi.  So very glad this place is in Whitefield :)"
4.0,"Woww!! This is what I felt after having the delicious Cheese paratha over here.Though a small place ,food here is fantastic! Happened to visit here for lunch & ordered French Fries Punjabi style which was very similar to the French fries we get elsewhere added with some masala . Cheese Paratha over here is a must have on your list as it's mind blowing.Other than this, you can also try Lassi of any flavor.Overall it has the 'Wow' factor associated with its food.Would definitely recommend this place. Of course, service here is one more thing that impresses you. Ambiance- 3/5 Food Taste- 4/5 Service- 4/5 Value for money- 4/5"
5.0,"Went here on Thursday evening, seats are very uncomfortable. Service is very slow. Too much ghee in food, plus no tandoor for a Punjabi restaurant."
3.5,"Nice north indian food, loaded with ghee. No tandoori roti is a big disappointment though. Seating is uncomfortable, seats are too small. Jeera rice was like veg pulav, parathas are good."
4.0,Awesome place for those in search of authentic Punjabi food .. There is no nonveg but the vegan delights make up for that !  Parathas are simply awesome and must be tried for the first time.. Lassi is spot on !!! Overall a good place to satisfy your tummy !
4.0,Mouth watering aloo paratha and Lassi. Lovely place to be. One suggestion: Few chairs are too small to sit comfortably. It would be great if they could be replaced.
4.0,The best Punjabi food that I have had in a long time. All the food items that we ordered was very tasty - especially the dhabey di daal and the chaas.  Definitely repeatable place since we are pure veg and its not easy to find pure veg punjabi restaurants. Could do with some more variety in the dessert side - the shahi tukra was not up to my expectations.
4.5,We love this place. The food is very good - little spicy for my kids. Use to appreciate the home delivery that they use to provide. Arpit - why don't you tie up with delyver so that you can still provide this service ?
3.5,Nice food... Paneer bhurjii and dal makhni n pronthe is awesome..mind blowing  Delivery time is also average... View is ok ok types.....nthng spcl
3.5,The reviews I read here are so fantastic... Only wish u guys were closer home... Maybe ul shd think of opening an outlet on Bannergatta road.... Lots of North Indian crowd here to cater to.
4.0,"Good food. Not so great ambience. If you want a pocket friendly meal home cooked, then this is the place. Cheese parathas, lassi, their special paneer curry (degchi wale) are a must to try. !! The starter menu can be improved...though!"
4.0,"A nice place to have Punjabi veg food. Great taste, average ambiance. The reason I gave 4 over 5 is that they take a lot of time to serve the food. Lassi is served in a mataki, which is great. They can improve on Paratha, their paratha doesn't look like as an Authentic Punjabi Paratha."
5.0,"Home made awesomeness'....amazing rajma...great samosa, chill lassi ....the only let down is the raita...but everything else rocks...have been here 4 times...I am loving it :)... Aloo Gobhi dry and rajma is a must try...special mention is the family which runs the place...."
4.0,"We love small family run places that have great food, and Kapoor's cafe is just that. When they first started, the only guests were the tired players from Gurukul sports academy, but now you can see more and more people coming mainly to Kapoors cafe. Everything we have tried has been good, but the Lassi is stellar. It is impossible to stop at one glass!!!"
4.0,"Yummy Punjabi lassi, paneer and paranthas with dollops of butter. Near Kundanahalli, this cafe offers a Punjabi fare. Plenty of parking but limited seating. Service can get a little slow during peak hours but the food is nice.   Try their dal makhni and paranthas. Would not say no to their rajma rice either."
4.5,"Located in isolated Thubrahalli area. The food served is mouth watering. Tried dal tadka, dal makhani, khasta paratha, kadhai paneer, aloo paratha covered in butter full Punjabi style. Yum! They take time to serve but believe me its worth waiting. Finger licking good parathas served here at a very reasonable cost. Must visit, Kapoor's Cafe will surely become a weekend lunch dinner spot for me."
4.5,Great place for mouth-watering Punjabi food. The lassi and chole bhature are really tasty. Total value for money food. We were two people and we over stuffed ourselves in just 330 bucks. But don't expect classy ambiance here. It's a very simple Punjabi place where you go to have food and that's what matters.
4.5,"Liked the food. Paranthas & lassi are closest you can get to Punjab.  Prices are very decent. The service has a personal touch from the owners, which makes you feel very welcome and cared as a customer."
4.0,"So homely, requested them to go easy on oil and spice(I do that almost every place I order from) and voila! Yummy northy food in the land of the south. I like everything here, my suggestion is to order whatever you fancy. Dont know what you fancy? Shut your eyes, run your finger along the menu, count a teensy bit and order whatever your finger falls on."
4.0,I went to kapoor's cafe today reading the rating and reviews on zomato and I must admit that I was not disappointed. I had aloo paratha and lassi. Taste was good. Ambience was homely. I liked it.
5.0,"Longing for north indian food, head straight to Kapoor's Cafe. The food is too good especially Khasta paranthas n all the stuffed parantha. Tried Paneer Degchi and have to say its awesome.  Lassi is a must must have. End the food on sweet note Fruit cream or Shahi tukda. My kids loved it too."
5.0,"Straight out of the kitchen home made punjabi food,which just melts in your palette: Kapoor's cafe sums it all .   Located inside the Gurukul compound this place has everything to be a stellar. We arrived here for lunch and quickly took to ordering the starters . Unfortunately much to our dissapointment Panneer pakoras were already over , so we went with Aloo Pyaaz pakoras and french fries punjabi style , both of which were decent . For the drinks we ordered dry fruit lassi , which was servered in a khullar all i can say it was Lassi-licious !  For the mains we decided to go with the paranthas . A special mention here is the cheese paratha ,with every bite one can feel the cheese melt down. For the gravy we decided to go with Paneer Degchi delhiwale , which was also good.  We ended our sumptuous meal on a high note ordering chawal ki kheer.  In all this place is very reasonable with a aura of one being at home. A second visit to this place is a must !!"
4.5,"I went there for breakfast on friend 's recommendation. It was awesome !!! Parathas were fresh ,hot and very Punjabi in taste.  Must try  cheese paratha and paneer pakora.  Will visit again for lunch / dinner."
5.0,I had been here along with my family and we really loved the food and hospitality. The combos were excellent. Keep it up! Will keep coming..
4.0,Good homey place and good Punjabi food. You can never go wrong here. I've been to this place countless times and have never been disappointed. And its pretty light on the pocket. The kadhai paneer is good and the Rajma chawal as well. The kheer and lassi is awesome too. Must try..!
3.5,"Kapoor's caf located inside Gurukul Compound, Thubarahalli. This is very much homely atmosphere. I have been to this place several times, particularly the days I eat veg food. I have tried their all combo menus, they are all good. Price is very reasonable, I would say it's less on the basis of the quality and quantity of the food they are serving. Ambiencecan to be improved and chairs are not verycomfortable. The behaviour of people around is quite good, which matters most."
4.5,The food tastes really good..the best is the aloo paratha with huge cube of butter on the top.the service is good..The price is decent..Overall a perfect place to have quality food..
4.0,Definitely a must visit place for the parantha lovers.  Great food in good price.  Its a small dhaba type place with good punjabi food.  My personal favorite is gobi paratha and baingan bharta there..  They serve kheer in small earthen pots. Good place for weekend brunch.. Should improve on interiors as the place leaks when it rains heavily...
4.0,"Home food (north) anyone :) .... When you are bored with all the spiciness around and want to have some feeling of being home. This is the place to go. Ambiance wise it would look like a normal dhaba kind.   The specialty of this restaurant is that it not only servers hot and delicious home type food even the staff also treats you in that way as well. I don't remember the last time when the cook from the kitchen brought hot roti from the tava and directly gave that to me or the rice from the pot. That does happens here.  I generally order a mini combo of dal, chawal and roti. Have enough for one person's appetite."
4.5,"I am not a Punjabi to call the food as authentic punjabi, but you will get excellent  north indian food over here. Amazing pakodas, very tasty sabjis and lassi in matka."
4.0,"Went there with one more friend. Its next to gurukul sports stadium.   Ambience wise not pretty good as its totally dhabba environment.  Ordered sweet lassi , paneer pakode , cheese paratha (kapoor's spcl ) paneer labdagar , aloo gobi dry, mix veg paratha, missi roti and at end the yummy shahi tukda with fruit cream. The paneer dish was aweseom..! The bill came out to be around 700 for 2 persons.  Ambience: 2.5/5 Food quantity: 4/5 Food taste: 4.3/5 Staff behaviour: 4.5/5 Overall: 4/5  Note: Dont miss the chesse paratha and fruit cream and the Shahi tukda dipped in rabri."
4.5,"Honest , yummy, vegetarian food from Punjab in a no-frills, clean setup. Kapoor's cafe is exactly what it claims to be. We started with chaas and lassi, both were just right. The lassi especially was superb with the kulhad flavours enhancing the taste.  The chhole puri was pretty good, though I'd like the pooris to be perfectly puffed up. They happily incorporated our special request of getting aloo parathas without oil, a specific dietary requirement. We ordered aloo parathas, phulkas, aloo jeera and dhabe di dal, all of them were nice. The dhabe di dal needs a special mention here.  We topped our meal off with shaki tukda for dessert and it was juicy, sweet and very satistying.  Overall, we loved the clean and neat setup, the attentive staff and the food."
5.0,I had no idea that my lunch will be so good. There is no better place to have better panjabi food than this. Tastes wonderful. I asked the managr to suggest me something and had a combo meal as he adviced. It was so tasty and yummi that i decided to have my next day lunch at same place. If you ever come to this side of the town dont miss a vist.
4.5,"This place runs on passion. The manager takes orders himself, supervises the preparation of the dishes and at times, even home-delivers your food himself. An extremely courteous and affable gentleman like him is rare to find. The food is another story. Nothing is ever too greasy or overly spiced. Even the quantities rarely fluctuate; the portions are just right  most of them perfect for two people. Depending on how hungry you are, you can either eat light (Fulkas and a sabzi) or go all out glutton and eat up a combo meal by yourself. The place even prides itself on its ambience. The dcor is soft and never shouts too loud for attention.   One of those places where even eating alone wont feel so terrible. Love it."
3.5,"This is a very decent place to hang out for a clean n tasty veggie food, As this s located near the Gurukul sports Academy after our game we used to hangout there espl for their Matti dha chaas n lassi. The rajma chawal along with the raita n papad is awesome. The ambience is quite dramatic with those serial bulbs n red themed interior. The service is quick n courteous. This s one f the good places for a light NorthIndian treat."

5.0,"simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication...!!read about this place in zomato thought of giving it a shot.Believe me i felt like having food at home,kachodi,parathe,bhature was lazawaab...lassi served in kullad was too good..I must say north indians in bangalore atleast once visit kapoors cafe ...i am foodie n i assure u'l luv d food....""paajI TussI Toh Chaa GayE"".!!"
4.0,Heaven for North Indians....homemade food away from home....:-) The food at Kapoor's cafe is a great delicious veg food straight from Punjab... The lip smacking paratha's and that lassi served in a kullad... Waah!  Maza aa jaaye yaar! Also the dhabe ki daal here is a must have ...:-)
1.0,It's too costly and the quality is now so degraded in comparison to 2014 where it I had given rating 4 star but now in 4 years span it's quality got bad and price also increased so much will avoid from next time
3.5,"Firstly lets start with me telling that finding this place took us quite a bit of time since the board is camouflaged in the daylight. Now coming to the place the ambience is a cross between a dhaba and a regular hotel. The sizing of the tables are compact and we were the first people there for lunch. We kicked things off ordering french fries punjabi style. It tasted ok wish it was a bit more crispier, then we ordered 2 punjabi lassi's they were good in taste and being served in matka's gave it a traditional twist.Now for the main course, we ordered Matar paneer, Aloo gobi and a few roti's. The khasta paratas were great in taste (ps:-Dont take the chilly ones).And jeera rice ordered along with that tasted pretty decent too.Overall quality of food was satisfactory and we were pleased with the experience. Pricing too is reasonable and the customer interaction was excellent. Overall this restaurant is a good try if you are on a budget and near whitefield."
4.5,"Awsome food, great service,welcoming hosts...I live in jp nagar and there has to be a strong reason why i should go to place so far off for a meal.... And this place holds all the reasons.. found this place accidently on zomato whilst a drive along with my friends; and was simply amazed by the reception, the food and the  dhaba like ambience... If only they could serve non veg ( the reason behind my 4.5 rating) overall a must visit."
4.0,"2.5 years in Bangalore and finally I could found a place which gives the authentic, home cooked punjabi and truly North Indian food.  Tried Parathas, Lassi, Matar Paneer, Dal, Roti and it was just yummy... If not for my full stomach, i could have eaten so much.. Loved this place..  You get such a homely feel, once you step in... Its goign to be on my list probably every alternate weekend, if somehow not every."
5.0,"Me and my hubby visited kapoor's cafe.. Came to know abt this place in the bangalore foodies club and we dined in there one saturday night.. Awesome food, Loved the set-up, A small dhaba like restaurant run by father and sons..  we had pudhina khastha paratha,chilli khastha paratha, malai kofta and we packed home some vegetable kolhapuri... Trust me guys food was just awesomeeeee, melted in my mouth. the malai kofta was so silky and awesome in taste.. Felt like being in heaven... Awwwww... The taste still lingers in my mouth and vahrevah the vegetable kolhapuri ... authentic in taste, so hot and soooo goood... I have never had such a great vegetable kolhapuri in the world.. The food was awesome... Keep up the good job guys... My only suggestion is to keep some tasty pickled onions, green chillies and pickles on the table or to serve these without people asking for it as it adds the perfect decorum to a dhaba...  I had dry fruits lassi and i felt that it could be lil thick...  Otherwise an awesome and perfect place to dine in ... Loved it.. Keep Rocking guys...                                             thecrumbstashdeepa.blogspot.com"
5.0,Amazing food especially 'poori aloo' and 'chola poori'. A must go place for breakfast lovers. Should definitely try out the lassi and chaas.
4.5,"Heard about the place from one of my colleagues and thought to give it a shot. I must say this place is a real delight to tastebuds.  The paranthas are simply yumm, full of stuffings. The cheese paratha is a must try. I also had aloo jeera and aaloo gobhi masala and it tasted like home food.  Buttermilk was a little on the sweet side and I did it like that much, however sahi tukda was delicious.   The place is run by a family and the father son combo tries their best to make your dining hassle free. Only downside- they donot accept cards, atleast they didnot when I visited this place."
4.5,"It's a boutique restaurant, which does not boast of air conditioning but has so much warmth in their service that one can never visit this restaurant just once. The richness in food is comparable to that of the richness in service. Extremely homely, thanks to Mr.Kapoor,Arpit and Apoorv, they don't treat you like guests, instead like a family. AffordAble is an understatement. Cleanliness is impeccable. Take my unlikely challenge of visiting them just once."
4.0,"Was her few days back and I was highly impressed by their quality of food. Totally affordable lovely ambience , known for their hospitality."
4.0,"Was there in whitefield area with family , being Navratre it's was no onion/garlic food for us. Read about the cafe in BFC and when called to enquire ,the prompt and warm response made us to go to Kapoor's cafe for lunch. A simple place with no frills , we ordered Dal tadka, paneer Bhurji , fulka ,Jira rice ,aloo paratha , sweet lassi .. Dal was really good . Paneer was good too. Husband loved the stuffed parantha and repeated his order for the same . Lassi tasted good but wasn't thick so would rate that as average . Jira rice was average too. Meal for 3 costed us 600 bucks which seems to be worth.  The owner was warm and seen taking keen interest to take care all diners around.  In all if you are looking for food with no frills , simple n home style Kapoor's cafe is the place.  The only turnoff for me was plastic cutlery , but that could be personal choice ."
4.5,Mouthlingering taste....definitely worth a go for the amazing food and service....its genuine and the father - son duo doing a great job by passing on the smiles.......by serving pure veg punjabi dhaba food.....loved every bite of it...
4.0,"Matka sweet lassi was nice, authentic north indian food"
2.5,"Dear Kapoors..  I write this as a message to you rather than a review. Living here in whitefield, the past few years., I have seen many food businesses open and shut. Most often the reason is carelessness about what people put on the plate, after they think they are established.  I have been to your place for lunch about 4 times so far. What we really liked about your place was good clean food that is freshly made, and the personalized family kind of service provided.  Which offset our little grumbles with the amount of time taken for an order to serve, basic crockery, and furniture. As long as the food is good nothing else really matters for a food house.  I have to say my last two experiences were less than satisfactory.. Here are the complaints.  Experience one : We reached your place around 2 pm.. ordered saying we are hungry.. we were told that there was a 15 minute wait. we agreed.. The food took close to one hour to arrive.. Even stuff that we ordered to get started .. papads, and raitha were not delivered to the table.. Your father did come across to tell us that since things being freshly prepared.. low on staff etc.. Not acceptable at all..  Experience Two : This was Sunday 28 Sept. The papads did arrive as there were only two tables occupied. But there is a definite change in the kitchen. The aloo raitha served to us was a disaster of a chilly powder raitha ! Even as we saw the color of the dish we realised there was something wrong.. and on tasting figured that someone just opened the chilly packet over the vessel. At once we brought it to your attention.. you said something like "" Oh that's how we make it "".. no sir.. as someone who has ordered the same dish.. one knows the taste the consistency, and level of spice.. Even adding an extra portion of dahi.. could not take down the amount of chilly dumped in the dish. looked like it it was out of proportion by about 8/10 times. more than anything else.. you should know the color of your dishes.. well enough..  The veg kadai we ordered turned out to be equally bad..  Having said the above.. We realize that there always can be bad days in the kitchen. But a good kitchen pulls around and makes the necessary correction. Penalizing your customer for a mistake in the kitchen I guess is not great punjabi hospitality.  Here are a few thoughts.. and suggestions..  1. the strength in the kitchen was the mother.. the learning chefs have to be taught better.. don't make the same mistake everyone else made.. 2. Arrange a better starters menu.. So the waiting is not painful.. salads can be good.. ( not the fried n refried ) keep them fresh.. So can chaats.. dice them.. throw into chaat.. while keeping to your terms of freshness.. 3. right next to a fitness house.. think of all the great beverages you can make.. not necessarily punjabi.. But hey.. 4. If there was a screw up in the kitchen.. don't excuse.. instead.. go back to the kitchen an correct it.. 5. your order management system is a defunct one.. something you should have researched already.. no one wants to come and wait for an hour to be served.. beef up your starters .. and get your boys to serve starters at least.. ( U can train them .. U have to)  6. going back to point 2.. design some beverages.. that goes along with the starters.. as long as something is there on the table.. no one complains.. 7. This is the last and final.. limit the menu.. but keep the quality.. and delivery time.. make x amount of Rajma.. x amount of Dal Makhni.. etc.. make them easy to serve.. along with the breads.. BTW this is purely my opinion. .. But a venture like yours needs to succeed.. and yesterday.. I thought you were failing like the rest..  In all sincerity.."
4.5,"The best north indian food one can have,very pocket friendly.Must try dry fruit lassi and shahi tukra.If you are foodie you will like this place."
5.0,"Awesome food stuff.. Especially Baigan bharta is awesome there. For Navratri, the Thali is fabulous..Paranthas are also good. Only constraint is you must go there with some patience"
5.0,"Wow what a place, First of all thanks to Kapoor's cafe for making my day. I went with my family for breakfast and it took me to my native towns memories of eating kachories. Awesome taste and pure touch of north Indian style.  Very tasty kachoories and Potato curry. This place is so tempting that I decided to visit them often and felt this place as ""North away from North"".   Anyone interested in north Indian snacks/food should give a try and I am sure you will relish the food items."
4.5,For some one who has been to atleast 50 cities arround the world and host of them in India ; it is always tempting to go to a boutique restaurant where the owner himself or herself ensures quality and personalized attention vs plastic service in the star ones... Kapoor Cafe is one such place ...we went to place expecting a normal North Indian joint promising the vrat food ; our experience was nothing short of delight ...from personalized taking of orders to recommendations .. And the hygiene ...( u see this in some Swiss cafes) the food was simply amazing ...it felt like being back in hinterland Punjab... The parathas are a must and a simple thing like Jeera Aloo remind you of an Amritsar dhabha...but the icing on cake ...fruit cream...fresh and yummy...never realized we could be tasting such a great Punjabi food ( they even made for us without onion and garlic due to Navratri on a special request ).... Any day favorite ...
2.5,"I went to Kapoor's cafe after reading lots of good reviews on Zomoto. But place was not upto the expectation. Food was spicey-even if we told at the time of order to keep it less spicy, my son didn't eat anything. We ordered Paneer do Pyaza, dhabe di daal, cucumber raita, fulka. Cucumber raita- too much red chili & salt, even if adding extra curd didn't give us relief Paneer do Pyaza, dhabe di daal - spicy fulka - garam-garam & soft Sweet Lassi - good but it was little too sweet  If you are going with children please make sure you make them clear instruction about spices you want, my suggestion don't go for medium spice, simply say no spices. Other thing which I don't like is plates used for eating food, they seems old and create doubt about hygiene. Management should start looking for better options for crockery-may be stainless steel. Overall food was average. Owners are warm and gave us suggestion for dishes. But I would like to try this place one more time, may be a bad day for me."
4.5,Awesome place for Authentic North Indian food and the uncle and his sons give personal attention to the food. To serve the best food service is bit slow but wait is worth when the first bite goes into the mouth.
5.0,A wonderful place to have typical north indian food. An ever smiling and warm uncle and his 2 sons welcome you to a hearty treat. U name it...you get it.  We had awesome aaloo puri. The baingan bharta is out of the world...so authentic...you'll rarely find it in Bangalore. It is a must try. The price is nominal for the quality that you get. Thanks Kapoor's Cafe for opening in Whitefield and making our life easier and tastier.
4.5,Just one word for this cafe... Awesome...
4.0,This place is a good place to sit and eat nice food. The food is tasty and have been to this place like more than 5 times.
4.0,Good food.. Worth trying.. Chaas is better than Lassi. Kullad chaas is a good thing. Point anything on the menu and you went be disappointed.
4.0,"VFM (value for Money) has become somewhat endangered speciesin a place like Bangalore, However in terms of food your search ends here @ Kapoor's Caf, I am staying in the PG nearby and not much of a Sports person , hence never visited Gurukul Sports Academy next to which this restaurant has came up recently. One day after calling up dominos for home delivery , I felt that budget of mine is bit tight and hence excused myself and started hunting for relatively cheap and good food. Saw reviews of Kapoor's caf and ordered Maharaja Combo#5. Every thing was perfectly cooked , good in taste and sufficient in quantity. I then decided to try their parathas(Aloo Pyaz and Gobhi) and it reminded me of the parathas prepared at home , no disappointment here as well. Lassi , chaas and shahi Tukda were equally good. Paneer dishes are rich and good in taste except Palak Paneer which I found average. The menu is not very exhaustive which in some sense is good as you don't have to ponder upon what to order. But I wish the Kapoor's include some more Combos with Dhabe di daal and other veg curries, It will help people like me who don't want to go for Ala-carte get the taste of everything and have more of choices. The ambience is simple and place is kept clean, you don't have to worry about parking as there is sufficient space in front of Restaurant.  Overall a great place to go with friends and family and enjoy authentic Punjabi food."
4.5,If you looking for a real authentic Punjabi (veg) food.. I will bet your search will end here.  And if you are looking for one of the best hospitality...again..this very same place.
4.5,"Kapoor's Cafe..is a stone's throw away from my house...Ironically I only came to know of it through Zomato. All the reviews seemed good, had made a mental note to drop in on a weekend. However on a casual evening walk, we walked in to just check out the place. A cosy restaurant tucked in at a corner in front of Gurukul academy...hubby mentioned he had seen the son-wife duo painting the walls by themselves during the initial days. I like people giving their personal touch to what they work on and it actually shows in the place. It was like walking in to a neighbor's house. The owner uncle at the cash counter warmly welcomed us. It was around 7:30 pm. Was not in a mood to have dinner so we decided to have some snacks. The owner uncle's son Arpit promptly walked to our table and gave us suggestions on what to have. So we ordered assorted pakoras, aloo paneer pakodas and lassi. The assorted pakoras have paneer and aloo pyaaz pakoras. The paneer pakoras were awesome ( I have'nt had such succulent paneer in Bangalore till date)..The aloo-pyaaz pakoras were just ok. The aloo-paneer pakodas were also too good. Very filling with a thick strip of paneer inside. The corriander-mint chutney were also good, but I personally feel they lacked a bit freshness. The lassi was superb..one among the best lassis we have had in Bangalore..  Service was superb, food is good and reasonable ....plan to drop in for dinner with parents who are fans of punjabi veg .. Kudos to the Kappor khandaan !! :) :)"
5.0,"Thanks to zomato found this really awesome place! Had a dinner with a friend here, its a really nice safe and cosy location, very women friendly! The decor is minimal and the chairs could be a bit uncomfy but it gives you the feel of a dhaba in the middle of the bustling chaos that bangalore is. We had three varieties of paranthas, paneer, onion and cheese, would recommend you to pick anyone and it would be great!  Pander butter masala had the right amount of spice and tang. Their jeera rice was a bit too oily though.  Do finish off with the shahi tukda, loved the Rabdi in it.  We had gotten quite irritated with the slow service in the beginning, had to wait ages but the food was worth it! Totally worth it!"
4.5,Delicious food for a very reasonable price. Great service and staff is really pleasant. Lassi here is divine !!
4.5,"Well, if you really are a FOODIE and care about awesome food and courteous service...step aside the Ambiance part than this is really the place for you. Have done repeated visits almost 5-6 times now and every single time my taste buds reach a new high. Ankur, the guy there who manages everything...is a jolly fellow and will greet you with a big smile once you enter the restaurant.  To start with the review, here are my findings  Food - 4.5 ( Things to die for - Lassi (they serve in Earthen pot), Paneer Pakoda, Pudina Khasta Paratha, Dabbe di Dal, Fruit Cream - I can have them over and over again  Service - 4.0 Ever smiling guys out there, takes your order smiling and the order preparation time too is not much.   Value For Money - 4.5 - Really worth it, the rates are pretty much reasonable, and for the kind of food they serve its amazing  Ambiance - 3.5 - Not really a place if you want to visit places for fancy Ambiance.  Go out there and enjoy your food. I bet you will not regret it.   PS:- Arpit, now I have finally written the review......I am getting discounts on my next visit :P"
4.5,"Kappor Cafe, Good place to have authentic Punjabi - Ghar ka Khana.  The place is very cosy and warmth with good service and hospitality. We tried stuffed and their special Chilly Khasta Paratha. comes in layer crispy worth trying. Food is not very oily and spicy.  Lassi and chaas were exceptional, thick creamy lassi was yum served in matka which bring very uniqueness. Hope you maintain quality and services.  Will definitely make visit again."
4.0,"Nice neat place run by a gentle family. The place boasts of welcoming hosts and a limited but a wonderful menu. Icing on the cake are their suggestions. They really want you to enjoy there and not just eat and leave. The place deserves repeat visits. Only thing i find missing is the non-veg food and guess they have no plans to start it either. But if you can be happy with veg food, this is it!"
4.5,The ambience is great.They have a lot of punjabi hoardings that is fun to read while waiting for the food. We had the combos and parathas here and they taste awesome. A little overpriced though. Tried ordering food online once and it works great too.  Service : 4.5 Food 4.5 Ambience 5.0 Price 3.5  Thumbsup!
4.0,"Ordered for a home delivery of combo meal on a lazy Friday afternoon. Though the delivery got quite delayed, the combo meal was tasty and sufficient for a person. Must add that though the service was a little slack, the guys were attentive and customer friendly and seemed to put in an effort to ensure that we like the experience."
5.0,"Visited Kapoor's Cafe for dinner. The Rajma was divine to say the least, best I've ever had in Bangalore. The whole set up is aesthetically designed with minimal botheration from fancy lights, music etc so that one can eat peacefully. The fact that Arpit's wife has done all the designing and the paint job was also done by the duo testified their passion. Arpit Kapoor is a wonderful host. Will visit again for a Dal Makhni :)"
1.0,On a late saturday evening my wife and I went to the cafe. We had seen it many times earlier and wanted to try out.   The menu is elaborate with every regular punjabi dish one could ask for. I absolutely loved the service by this young gentleman who we guess must be the owner. All in all it was worth every penny spent.
4.5,"Pros - Nice place, original food, warm host, decent price.  Cons - Slow service (which I hope will improve with experience soon)"
4.0,"We chose kapoor's cafe coz some of my friends don't eat non veg on Thursdays. We had heard a lot about the place from our friends and decided to give it a try. There were five of us!! We reached there around 8 pm. The place wasn't crowded being a weekday. We walk into the place greeted by a big smile ushering us in.  We started with rounds lassi and buttermilk served in classic earthern pots. Paneer pakodas make awesome starters choice. We were all nicely warmed up and ready for some heavy stuff. Chole batura is the best if its kind  From what I have heard, a north Indian's delight in Bangalore. Aloo paratha doesn't disappoint either with heavy slice of butter still melting away while you bite in. We chose a dish with three types of Paneer to be on the side of some classic paratha. Missi roti was a slight disappointment on an otherwise lip smacking series of food. Fruit cream for dessert is the best way to end it. Chawal di kheer wasn't good at all and shahi tukra was just okay okay. Overall, a nice place to tickle your veg Punjabi taste buds. We did leave with a smile."
4.5,"I generally go here for breakfast, particularly ""Aloo Kachori"", that me and my wife had been longing for for so long, until they arrived. However, I didn't restrict my taste buds and have explored other offerings as well over time and I can safely say that whatever they serve is just amazing. I must not miss out to mention the warmth with which the family, yes you read that right, Family, welcomes you and serves you makes the experience even more special.  The quality of food and this very humble family will surely make you go back to this place for more.  Please continue to maintain the standards. That's all I ask for. Thanks a lot."
4.5,I'm a regular to this place and I Really like the taste of the food here. Fulkas are soft and most of the curries I tried are delicious. They tend to put little more oil in curries sometimes.
4.5,"This review comes after a couple of dining experience at this place.  Kapoors cafe was an accidental find, while we were browsing through zomato for a quick dinner near home. This place had quite a number of positive reviews and we decided to try it out.  I was impressed right from the moment I entered the premises.  Bang on the main road, yet aloof from it. This place is right beside Gurukul badminton courts, some 300-400m from kundalahalli gate. Highway motel types name board welcomes you in. The place is simple. It has a open portico types seating, if you want to enjoy the food, with some cool breeze, or you can sit inside as well, the place is neat and tidy.   Its more of a dining house than a restaurant, owners are really warm and try their best to accommodate our preferences, if that is possible.   Coming to the food part, we had lassi,chaas, aloo paratha, rajma, phulka, boondi raita and I topped it up with a cup(or should i say kulad) of Tea.  Lassi and chaas were exceptional, thick creamy lassi was yum and the chaas wasnt the usual jeera powder mixed thin curd, but thick buttermilk. I felt that quantity was less, may be because it was so tasty, I couldnt keep the khulad down ;).   Rajma was amazing, cooked really well with apt amount of masala, doesnt hit your throat with full blast of hot spicy masala, neither does it feel bland. Phulkas are soft.   Parathas are served with large dollop of butter, green chutney and pickle. Stuffings inside are evenly spread  and lavish, its really stuffed . I liked the chutney too, not too runny or extensively spicy, its just the kind which will make you relish the paratha all the more. Parathas are big; two paratha can be really filling.  Second time, we decided to try  varieties of paratha: onion, aloo, paneer and cheese. All were good, but cheese paratha needs a special mention, every piece you tore out of the paratha cheese just oozed out, so much so that it will put even a cheese burst pizza to shame. It is must, if u love melted oozing cheese; though i must warn you, considering the size of parathas and amount of cheese, its really heavy, never ever try it at the fag end of the course.   I think you might do good to give the deserts a miss. Not that its bad, but the other items are so good that it makes deserts look run of the mill. And personally i would like to awesome taste of parathas linger in my mouth little longer, its totally worth it.   Request to the owners: Please please maintain the quality, keep a check on taste, coz taste sells"
4.0,"First, it was a little difficult to locate the place. Search for Gurukul Sports Academy and you cannot go wrong. Chole bhature and sweet lassi falls under 'must have' category.Loved the dal makhani too.Homely atmosphere.Felt like having ghar-ka-khana.The combos are easy on the pocket and you'll be full after having one.Shahi tukda was not up to the mark. The nuts on top were soggy instead of being crunchy.Overall: A good place to have simple homemade food which doesn't affect your stomach. Recommended for children and elderly people too.  Will come back again for the hospitality and 'course for the fluffy chole bhature!!!"
5.0,I love this place. The service is brilliant.. although a little slow but its worth the wait! too damn good!
3.5,"Kapoor's cafe was an instant plan... Though I was bit apprehensive how it will be... But It turned out to be really good... Credit goes to my friend Reva...For anyone looking for good punjabi food in Bangalore, I'll say it meets the requirements pretty well. Given that I have had such good dal makhni after a long time in Bangalore - it had perfect color and taste! (Something which I have not seen in a lot of restaurants in Bangalore).  The best part was that everything was fresh when they served. Maybe it opened new, that can be a factor - but if they maintain this - I am ready to recommend this to a lot of people.  Must try - pakoda plate, lassi, parantha (we tried cheese and Gobi which was pretty good), dal makhni and fruit-creme.   Raita and all was okay, you can skip also.   Value for money - yes Food variety - good Food quality - very good Location - little difficult to find, but worth it  Tip - if you are little health/weight conscious, remind the server to put little less butter :p. Also try to carry cash, as they are soon to start card service.  *Still missing the fruit creme*  Hope you enjoy the cafe :)"
3.5,It's A nice place to hangout with friends. Awesome hospitality. Great food. Must try chandigarh special aloo paratha.
3.5,"After my couple of visits finally decided to post the review,WE were looking for some authentic veg food around Whitefield and gave chance to delight our taste buds. the place is quite hygienic and serve pure desi Dhabe style food.The phukla were served rite from the kitchen with ghee just sliding over it and you can feel the freshness on your table.the aloo ghobhi was having authentic taste with raw spices and dhabe is daal was too a taste maker.specialty in drink was chaas which Iprioritized a healthier option then any other, the next visit was for combo which I gave try to my favorite chole bhature, aah...that's mouth watering..A thumps up toteam on there food stuff and well in budget ,its family driven son and father well all time in there with all respect given to there man sitting on counter.. :)on Peak time you may have to wait as limited staff I believe in kitchen.Carry cash with you as they don't accept cards.The only thing I would like to advise them is to change the cutlery's and switch out from fiber to some other better options.Must try for Vegan lovers!!"
4.0,"Would like to keep this short and crisp. Went there yesterday with friends and was surprised to see how these people have transformed a shanty little place to a homely and serene eatery. Ambiance - 4 - For me, this is of utmost importance . And I was pleasantly shocked to find that this place had good ambience. Considerably better than the so called 'all-timers'(Delhi Durbaar, Punjaabi Kitchen and company).  Food - 4 - Food was good. Dhabe di Daal had an authentic dhaba-ish flavour and Baigan ka Bharta, being a personal favourite, was gobbled up in seconds. Could have done with bit less sweetness in the ""Delhi Degchiwaale Paneer"". Lassi was good qualitatively, not quantitavely. And Shahi Tukda was a tad bit overrated.  Service - 5 - Now this is what stands out for this specific restaurant. It being a relatively new place , staff and management were eager to help and were prompt in their tasks. We were catered to very well and I would recommend this restaurant to everyone, based on this. 'Make Hay while the Sun shines'.  Everything said, for me, only regret was of 'this being a pure veg restaurant'. But I believe this could be a pretty decent go-out place for everyone.  4/5"
4.5,Excellent food and wonderful hosts. The aloo paratha was delicious as was the Chole bhatura. Would definitely love to come here more frequently.
5.0,"Ohhhhhhhhh Myyyyyy GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD..:) Kapoors cafe is speedily been gaining a reputation as a vegetarian and tasty food innovation. And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Kapoor's best-kept secrets form few days now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so-called food revolution happening in the Bangalore Area (Whitefield). And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Kapoors cafe.   The restaurant is located in a rather unassuming converted warehouse thats quite easy to miss. However, the interior will remind visitors of a tropical paradise. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isnt the only thing bringing folks to Kappors cafe. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.   We started with Kapoors famous deconstructed Punjabi Lassi, which is essentially a drink of heaven..:) (Which they make themselves), and truly remarkable, perfectly done and served in mud glass. My wife, bhaiya and bhabi shared four orders, which consisted of four full mud glass of taste of kapoors goodness.     In the Main course we ordered #Aloo pyaaz pakora, aloo pyaaz paratha, aloo jeera, Punjabi dal tadka, khasta paratha, shahi tukra and we loved to bite every single bite every time..:)The dishes were executed perfectly, and the bright color of the ingredients peeking through it was a feast for the eyes as well to the stomach.   Though I would love to be selfish and keep Kapoors taste all to myself, the work of everyone there is too good to stay hidden for long. Theres no doubt a table at kapoors cafe will quickly become the hottest reservation in town.  Words would certainly not make the justice to the food and its taste served at kapoors caf.just go and try you will love it..:)  CHAK DE! Bangalore..:)  With Love, Shailesh.GN"
4.0,"Kapoor's cafe is in the same complex as GuruKul's - the Badminton place.I have seen this place since we started to play here and it seemed inviting.So today finally me and wifey visited here as our friends were taking some more time to get to Gurukul's.First of all the ambiance is good and feels like a typical dhaba on the highway.The waiters whom I am presuming also the owners of the place are pretty friendly as well and most importantly they dont make you wait too long for your food. The menu has a lot for everybody from combo meals to parathas,phulkas and some awesome curries.Since we were short of time, we ordered aloo parathas and chaas to drink. The aloo paratha was one of the best I have ever had in Bangalore.It is served with a dollop of butter on top while the paratha has some super interesting flavors in it like ginger,chilli and aloo and some yummy dip which is made out of chilli and radish and some garlic.The chaas also was awesome and this place is a must try for people who are looking for good punjabi food. Overall a good experience and decent pricing.  Rating - 4/5 Budget - 200 for 2                                             lohith1509.blogspot.com"
4.0,"Best Service, very courteous and friendly people.  Lassi could have done with some more malai though. Else food was great. Loved the experience!!"
4.0,I love the breakfast here! try the cheese paratha and chhole bhature with lassi and kheer. yet to try the main course but definitely coming back for more! cute ambience too.
4.0,Excellent food. Authentic punjabi test.
4.0,Good place to have Punjabi food. Service is bit slow and taste is not consistent but still I would rate this place a 4. Keep the good work and continue to improve.
4.0,"Read about this place on Zomato and on seeing some real nice reviews had to visit so today lunched at Kapoors. Good thing we did as it was really great to taste some authentic North Indian cuisine especially if the wife is from Amritsar.  The Sports Gurukal being Kapoors neighbor there is plenty of parking available. Entered this quaint place which gives you an appearance of a dhabha and to there is a Cooler to boot. This is a place which has concentrated on the quality of the food they serve and not the ambiance. It was clean and neat with basic furniture, cutlery and crockery.    Arprit-the guy that runs the show appeared immediately to assist us with the Menu and suggestions. Unique Menu card-see the picture appended.     Asked for:-    a)	Paneer Degch Delhiwale (special):- A three flavored paneer dish that was sweet, spicy and tangy-it had small pieces of paneer in thickish gravy that had abundance of various taste. The enigma of the dish was that when tasted from various sides it had these three distinct flavors pop up. Quantity was for four persons or are we small eaters? Loved it.  b)	Arprit had recommended Dhaba Ke Dal-good thing he did otherwise we stick to the beaten path of either Makhani or Fry. This Dal was different-not overly spicy but gave the palate an experience of sensations that it never had before. Again the quantity was for four. It had the right consistency and prepared with the right ratio mix of different types of lentils (correct Arprit?)  c)	Pudina Khasta-That is the way a Khasta is made-layers on layers with the pudina never dominating.  d)	Missi roti-one of the best tasted in Bangalore.  e)	Phulkha-like my wifes!! it came all puffed up with warmth-lovely to see a phulkha bloated otherwise you are served with limp ones.  f)	Lassi;- it came served in a kullar-a small mud container-with a miniscule bit of Kesar-nice.  g)	Nimbu Paani-that was a disappointment-too watered down-little or no lime.  h)	Plate of Paneer pakoras with mint chutney-this we brought home for tea.      Service-4.5/5    Ambiance 3/5    Cost ;-     4/5    Food        4/5    Thank you Rinku you are really good keep it up young man you will go places."
4.0,"A definitely-go-to place if you are looking for a nice north indian breakfast. Located next to gurukul sports academy, it had a lot to offer.  A not so happening environment, but it makes u feel like home with the way they have used the space. From taking orders to billing, they treat u with a smiling heart making u feel like home.  We ordered for parathas, puri aloo, bread pakoras and samosas. Loved every bit of it specially the bread pakoras. It reminded me of my early days at home eating pakoras on a sunday morning cooked by your mom. With reasonable rates, every item that we ordered had a standard of much higher quality. The parathas and the puri aloo was cooked very well and that we could feel while eating. Not to forget the lassi that we tried, made my day. It was purely an icing on the cake, thoroughly loved it.   A place not to be skipped even if u prefer south indian food, must be tried for a change."
4.0,"Me and my friends are proper foodies and we always look to explore new places.We came across Kapoor's in Zomato and thought of trying it out.I f you are not a regular at Gurukul sports complex its very hard to spot the place. Nevertheless the place has a small cafe like ambiance with soft(low volume) Punjabi and Hindi music.The place is pretty comfortable.In and around Bangalore if you look for authentic Punjabi khana experience you will have to go back to a few dhabas in Mysore road operated on by actual Punjabis or the Alsoor gurudwara road.Other than that there are the well established chains which is never the same.We got that authentic taste in that food for the first time in Bangalore(I am not exaggerating).The lassi was brilliant ,so were the Dal Makhaani and Shahi Paneer.The service was exquisite which I fear is very difficult to maintain if there are more number of customers or they had a full house.The best thing that I liked was we were served completely inflated tawa rotis one after the other ; not at once.Once again the food was brilliant.And if you stay in the vicinity it is a place that you should try out.Mouth watering stuff!"
4.5,Thanks to kapoor cafe. It was nice restaurant to have a food and authentic taste after long time I was searching for taste in food. I am planning to go the next time also
4.5,Dad Sis and me just have one word to say - Wow Now it's time to take my other cousins and mum to enjoy the delicacies.  Kapoor's Cafe we are coming soooon

5.0,Boss I just loved the food you serve. Bangalore you need to visit this place to understand what authentic punjabi food means.
4.0,Finally after planning and planning for 3 weeks I finally went to this place. Me and my friends were generously greated by Mr Kapoor an elderly person followed by his son Arpit with a beautiful smile. We were very hungry and started with aloo paratha and lassi. Followed up with one pudina khasta paratha each with shahi paneer. Loved it. Wanted to try the shahi tukra but was so full so got it packed as I could not resist and thank God I did get it packed as it was amazing. In all I adored the entire experience and will definitely go back again and again and again. Wish you had a branch in koramangla. Love u guys. Thanks again
5.0,amazing vegetariam food ya.. never had such parathas in my life forget bangalore. will definitely go.back again and take my family this time.
5.0,"After hearing from a friend of mine working with intuit who had taken his team for dinner here I decided to try this place out for team dinner. Some guys did say its only veg and were a bit sceptical going there but finally we decided to go and try it out. Reached at around 9.20 and styarted with paneer pakoras, onion pakoras and lassi (as suggested by Mr. Arpit Kapoor the owner and host which was surprising but we loved the attention and personal touch) And we hogged in fact my team most guys had 2 lassis before the main course it self.  For dinner we had paneer butter masala, paneer do pyaaza, paneer delli degchi wale (had a sweet tinge to it), dhaabe ki daal, punjabi daal and khasta paratha again suggested by Mr Kapoor which is a four layer paratha and has pudina and chilly flavor to it. I personally liked the chilly khasta and paneer delli degchi wale - weird sweet and chilly combination but worth it. Mmuuaahh.  Yes not to forget I also liked the shahi pulao. We ended with deserts and ordered all they had on the menu - Shahi tukda, fruit cream which was out of the world and chawal ki kheer. All were lovely  So my team which is 60% non veg loved the food and my bill also came to be easy on the pocket.  I definitely recommend this place to every one as a must try.  The ambience is pretty nice, not too high a place but simple and lovely to sit and eat.  Thank you Mr Kapoor for your hospitality and the amazing food. Cheers Jayesh"
4.5,Awesome food..ambiance. ..gr8 place to have yummy punjabi delicacy
5.0,I visited this  place with my team and I had a lavishing feast in this place and the service  & ambience is  extraordinary.
5.0,"A casual weekday while I was struggling to find a place to eat, I came across this amazing restaurant. Had difficulty in locating this restaurant but since I had decided to eat here so with all the efforts, I managed to reach here. The moment you enter, you get amused with the kind of decor they have, so pleasant like just so pleasant. It cant be any better.. And once you make your self comfortable and decide what to eat, that is where the toughest job begins. Everything they have on their menu is just awesome. You get that homely feel when you eat it. Trust me guys, they know how to get it right. I go to minutest of details when it comes to food and I just relished what I had. Its a must must try restaurant. And I will have anything and everything that you have on the list. Next time its chhole Bhature's turn and Aloo Kachori and Lassi :) You guys are doing superb job and it feels so good to have khana at your place. Keep up the good Job. :)"
4.0,"I have been a regular at Kapoor's Cafe probably since the day it opened. And whatever i have tried here, from the simple kulhad chai to the mouthwatering Paneer and Gobi Paratha's and the Veg Thali's and otherdelicacies from their menu, has been amazing. The taste of the food is lasting which makes you come back to this place. And the courtesy of the staff is an add on.The ambiance of the place is good. Space to accommodate 40-50 people at once.I had even got a team lunch organized over here during one of our internal Badminton tournaments (with 50-60 people), and everyone was delighted with the taste of the food over here.The only advice that i would like to give is to improve on the service time/delivery time of the items a bit. But also I do believe that one has to wait a bit for something good :)."
4.0,This rating is for awesome north indian food..finally a place where u can eat good food
4.5,"Homely food. Value for money. Good , courteous  service. Just few things:  that the laasi could be given in a bigger mitti ka glass, more variety in combo meals would also be great. Overall - good place to have a meal."
5.0,"My search for authentic  Kachori Aaloo ended at this amazing place. Believe it or not, but I was struggling to find a place for long in Bangalore where I could have something similar to home made stuffed kachoris that we all North Indian folks are used to.     And then this Sunday, i just happened to read somewhere about this place ""Kapoors Cafe"" and I am so glad that I landed up in this cute and cozy den. On arrival, we were welcomed by Arpit (Mr Kapoors Son) and from there it felt we were at one of our friends home only.    Everything we had (Poori, kachori, pickles, chas and tea) were almost like home made that, I really felt like I am at my home. And then when Arpit told that the entire kitchen staff was trained by his mother, then I was not surprised as to why is it tasting like Mom cooked food  :-)     It was unfortunate that we could not meet Mrs Kapoor this time, but it gives me all the more reason to visit this place sometime soon to thank her for providing such mouth watering north indian dishes in Bangalore.    God bless Kapoors and will meet you all more often. And last but not the least.. Arpits hospitality is amazing and his smile is infectious. Cant wait to visit this place sometime soon.....    Cheers  Amit"
3.5,"This is a newly opened joint in the campus of Gurukul sports academy. Went here for dinner on a Saturday night with friends.   This is a small place neatly designed and maintained with a seating capacity of approx 40 people and has some of the tables in the open which looks good.  The guy taking orders seemed to be the son of the owner and  was a tremendous host. That guy was the highlight of the dinner, kept all the guests feel comfortable and was so courteous .   The food is good, we ordered paneer dishes, dal, layered paratha and lassi . Every item is made with perfection and tastes good. Dry fruit lassi was too good .  Pricing is moderate , but a must go or people in this area.   Also, I would like to mention that the guy attending to people was getting compliments from almost everyone while leaving (we also did) . Well done :)"
4.5,Good food. Bad service - slack & messed up orders for a week day. Rating for food alone.
2.5,"I'm editing the review just because of the service . Please read my review below for the food .   A restaurant  can not be just about food . It has to be with a good service too . Many times I have avoided saying / writing  very bad about the food because  the service was top notch . They are apologetic if the food is not good .  This Sunday husband and I decided to go to this place again for chola bhaturas and the yummy paranthas they make . We reached at 9:45 , decent breakfast time . Turned out that they have changed their timings and now they open at 10 am .   First of all if a breakfast place is opening at 10 , it doesn't solve the purpose . 10 o clock is way beyond breakfast time .   So anyways , when we found out that they open at ten . We were ready to wait . Husband went and asked the guy inside if we can sit inside and wait .  The guy / owner ( no idea ) was looking at his phone said no you can't , cleaning is going on , come after ten . There is a way of saying things specially to the customers . I am not in the food industry but very well know that if you can talk properly you can serve many more customers .   We were disappointed / annoyed and of course hungry after 10 am . We decide. To just leave the place and go somewhere else .   I'm definitely not going here again .      My last review :  When it comes to breakfast joints in Bangalore ( specially other than South Indian ) , there are very less options . Don't get me wrong , I really love and adore the South Indian breakfast joints and I constants try to explore a new South Indian place when I plan for breakfast outing .  But there are times when the palate crave for proper North Indian breakfast , deep fried puris , bhaturas , the cholas , the paranthas . Ammn my mouth is watering now :) .  So I was just going through zomato one day when I stumbled upon this place , and saw this as breakfast joint . Almost jumped out of my seat and that too in whitefield , what coincidence :) . I immediately decided to check out the place , got husband and friends excited about it too . The amazing wet Sunday morning , gorgeous weather and we reached here around 8:45 .   Ambiance :  The ambiance is pretty ordinary , little colorful inside with a tv . Comfortable chairs . I think they haven't spend much on it . But I wouldn't worry about it as long as it is clean and I'm getting good food in reasonable prices .   Food :  We hogged like crazy , these are the things we ordered  Chole poori Kachori Alu  Alu pyaz parantha  Bread pakoras  Punjabi lassi  Chaas Dahi wadas Kulhar chai   Everything we ate was homely ,the paranthas tasted really good .  I have to give special mention to pakoras , oh they were delicious . We ordered one plate and then again ordered one more because we just couldn't do with one :p   The cholas were perfect , perfectly spiced .   Alu Kachori tasted yummylicious . The kachoris  were really light and they tasted great .   Lastly we ordered dahi vadas too bit they were really a disappointment . The vadas were hard , the curd was not cold . It just did not gel along with what we had earlier .   The lassi Chaas and chai in kulhars . Loved it . They were really fresh   Service :  There was only one guy who was serving and only one lady who was cooking . So you have to be patient . But trust me it will be all worth the wait .   Since she is the only lady who is cooking , you will know what homely food means .   I asked the owner , if he is mr Kapoor and yes he was . He was very sweet , talked to us , saw what we wanted and made sure we got it :) .   Vfm : well , here is the best part . All of that , the scrumptious meal for 4 of us was just 515 bucks . Wow , where was this place earlier .   I wish to get chola bhaturas and samosas next time , because they were not available as they were still getting prepared .   Definitely recommended !!"
5.0,The best vegetarian restaurant I had been in Bangalore till date. Must visit place for all vegetarian food lover's.  Woh mud pot lassi is awesome to start the food.   Thanks to Kapoor's Cafe to giving an opportunity to taste punjabi food in Bangalore.
4.0,"We have to Gurukul complex a lot earlier for Badminton and then one of our friend came to know about this place which has opened recently. So we decided to check out this place for Sunday breakfast. The place has a very humble ambiance but very comfortable chairs so no issues with that. We ordered  2 Chole puri (loved them - see the pic) 2 Bread pakora 1 Kachori aloo 2 Aloo pyaaz paranthas 1 Tea 1 Chaach 2 Punjabi Lassi (too good) 1 Dahi vada Unfortunately, they were not able to serve chole bhature & Samosas which we wanted as they were still under preparation. Next time may be, cause what we were served was really good. Chole poori were really good and definitely recommend it to all and also Kachori aloo- we were happy to eat them.  Again Bread Pakoras reminded me of Delhi, so again I was very happy. They made lovely and yummy Aloo pyaaz paranthas... All in all lovely food except Dahi vada which were little hard :( But I will give special mention for Punjabi Lassi which was very nice topped with a layer of Malai :)  And we noticed that the kitchen is run by the lady, we saw her kneading the dough, etc. so we understood how the food gets the homely taste.  I will definitely recommend this place. Ambiance : 3 / 5 Food : 4 / 5 Service : 3 / 5  So on our second visit to this place, we got to taste the Chole bhature, samosas and fruit cream (added the photos).  The samosas were absolutely yummm... hubby was really happy with them.  We repeated the bead pakoras, Allu pyaaz parantha (friend was reminded of her home), chaach and lassi.  We had the amazing hospitality from Arpit. He told us how they have got cooks from Delhi, and how are taking care of their families as well which is really nice. Now they have put a kind of windchime/bell on the door and once you leave, ring it (pizza hut type concept)  Again we had the lovely experience of yummy food and lovely hospitality in a very humble ambiance... So now I change my rating again. Ambiance : 3.5 / 5  Food : 4 / 5  Service : 4 / 5"
4.0,"Great,tasty punjabi vegetarian food. Absolute value for money. We tried the paneer pakodas.....chunky cubes of paneer with thin crust coating. Rest of the restaurants...thin slices of paneer needs to b searched. Food is perfectly spiced. ..we had the kadhi pakoda...baingan bharta...smoky and spicy...paneer butter masala was ok. The khasta parathas were the best till date...3 flavours...pudina...chilly..plain. Tea...fruit cream...chaas...laasi served in kulads. Fruit cream was loaded with fruits and dry fruits.  Please visit this place for the simple authentic food...the ambience however is just ok. The quality of food here easily beats so many upscale punjabi restuarants in bangalore.The owners.. Arpit Kapoor and his family are an added treat for their hospitality.  The touch of homely punjabi food is evident from the fact that Mrs Kapoor is involved in the kitchen."
5.0,Great food at a reasonable cost Keep it up
4.5,"I was craving for some punjabi food the other day and I decided to try out the newly opened Kapoor's Cafe at Whitefield. I must say it was a wise decision as the entire experience was heavenly. It is a spacious eat out with a very modern Dhaba look and a quite cozy  feel to it. We had a plate of assorted pakoras with their signature delicious green chutney.Their paneer pakora was so fresh and melt in mouth that I am craving for it right now :) . For main course we had Khasta Paratha and Paneer Degchi Delhiwaale which is a little on the sweeter side but the flavours were right . it was the first time I had Pudina Khasta paratha and it was a delicious 4 layered paratha with a hint of mint .The food was light , fresh and had a touch of homeliness. My friend and I enjoyed the food. The staff was very helpful and courteous and their service was quick. I found the prices reasonable for the quantity they served. I wish they could increase the variety and add a few other drinks as well. It was a pleasant experience and I am definitely going there again."
5.0,Awesome food!! Lassi is something you dont want to miss here..!!
5.0,"In blr, when we order a northindian food, it comes with a small flavour of south india. This place was awesome. Pure authentic north indian punjabi veg food. Very simple small place."
5.0,In my hunt for good vegetarian fuel I have  made many a pit stop in Bangalore..  This forage brought me to the steps of Kapoor's Cafe located in Whitefield on a regular route that I take home.  Honestly..  I would kill for the Lassi that was served the first time and was surprised to find the quality and taste unchanged  when I went a few weeks back. I and my family have gone through the parathas (these are served with lumps of butter.. Would love homemade makkhan to replace that) and the combos and found the preparation homely and well priced. My Dad gave an instant thumbs up to the chutney that was served along with the parathas. The ambience is an attempt to remind you of times spent up North and being someone who was born and brought up in Rajasthan it was somewhat like coming back home.. I know I am going to go back for more and try the Kachori Chhole and the rest of the fare.

2.0,"Read good reviews about the place on Zomato, being a punjabi myself got really excited as this was near my house and I always crave for good punjabi food. So one day while coming from office decide to try this place, as it was around 5 was only things available were bread pakora , chole bhature , samose etc . Decide to parcel bread pakora and chole bhature.    Bread pakora: the only taste I can get was of the oil, the filling was very average, not good  Chole bhature : bahure also had the same problem of over powering taste of oil, chole were OK   Was disappointed with the food, maybe my choices were not good.  Food - 2/5 Ambience  3/5 VFM 2/5"
4.5,"When I visited in June: God sent paranthas...yummilicious :)  After 5 months when I visited Banglore again to my crazy frnds, we decided to go here again for the breakfast, this time I ordered Cholle Bhature, expected them to be as good as their Paranthas, but alas they were good but not parantha level good. Then again I ordered a parantha and the magic got restored.  Apart from it, father and son who manage the cafe has a great business sense, the amount of thought they have put and the passion they have towards their cafe is commendable. Respect _/\_ I gave a 4 star rating earlier, but have to revise it to 4.5, they really deserve it. Give it a try, its worth your time."
5.0,Amazing Punjabi food.... tasty parata.... matka lassi was very yummy....
5.0,This is easily the best Punjabi food one can get in this side of the Bangalore . Lassi tastes divine and matka container  just makes it refreshing ! Khaasta Paratha -chilly is a must try ! In short its a gastronomical treat !To add to this Mr.Kapoors hospitality makes it a must visit place !
3.5,"Very homely ambience.  Started with matka chaas which was just right!  Set up our taste buds for the rest of our order ...  Yummy!! The chole were from a clean punj heart, as were the phulkas and the dhabe di daal.  We also had paneer paratha and a bhatura ... Pretty good.  The veg kolhapuri could have been more defined ... Very attentive service.  For a sumptuous meal, it was value for money for sure ...   They could change the thin and sharp plastic spoons with the kheer ...  Will go back for sure."
3.5,"Overall very tasty food and superb service. Likes: Tasty food, superb service, superb lassi, superb fruit cream...don't miss it Dislikes: Spicy. We gave them feedback to ask the customer while taking order whether they need spicy or mildly spicy preparation... It was a good eating experience, and we will certainly go again and again"
5.0,Really good north indian place in Whitefield.  The Lassi was served in little pots and was really good. The khasta paratha - excellent - the dal and paneer - again really really good. Service is great and these guys really take care of you.
4.0,"Planned on going to Kapoor's Cafe soon after seeing their insert with the newspaper one morning, thinking of a family owned place with recipe's from a mom's kitchen perfected over the years. Was encouraged to see a family of 2 generations manning the counters.  Place: The place is nice, clean and simple with wood-look tables and chairs.  Friendly, home like environment is what makes it special.  Service: Service was excellent. The person attending was soft spoken, smiling and attentive.  Water was served in disposable plastic glasses which were flying around under the fan.  The red plastic cutlery was a bit disappointing.  Food: A place like this is all about the food. The first items to hit our table were the lassis, sweet, dryfruit and chaas, served in earthen pots. All 3 were good, liked the sweet the most. Then came the chole bahature. Simply amazing.  The khasta paratha, rotis were good. The cheese paratha was ok and so was the daal tadka. The jeera-rice was fine too, a little too oily than required for it to be. Paneer butter masala was ok.  For desert, we had fruit cream. Loved it.  I would want to go back there soon for breakfast and try the kachori aloo, as I can imagine how it is going to be.  Overall, good, heart-warming, comfort food."
5.0,Amazing food!!! Thank you Kapoor's Cafe :)
