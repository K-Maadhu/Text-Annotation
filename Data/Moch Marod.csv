4.0,"Ambience : This is a typical dhaba with wooden cots lined up on which you can eat. Completely rustic.  Food : They have three sizes of every dish - Queen, King and Emperor. The parathas served with curd and lots of butter, are delicious. The lassi and butter milk was good too. The King size lassi/butter milk is 1 litre, and King size paratha was enough for three of us, mind you. So choose wisely according to your appetite!"
5.0,"Being a North Indian, I am always in hunt of North Indian food in Bangalore and look what I found here ! My favourite food ever - Paranthaaaas.   Always excited to eat Pranthas and love the concept of the biggest paranthas here in the form of queen, king and emperor size. The Prantha is served with Ghar ka white Makhan which is just delicious. They serve lassi as well which is equally tasty. The lassi is also available in the different sizes.   Its a very small place but I love the vibe and eating the pranthas on the cot. The place is super busy on weekends, so you must get before time if really wanna have the Pranthas, otherwise they will be sold out soon. Will keep coming to this place to eat the tastiest food. Its a must visit place. You can have really good food without burning a hole in your pocket :D   Service - 5/5 Ambience - 3/5 Food - 5/5 Value for money - 5/5 Quantity - 5/5!"
5.0,Dhaba style place which serves extremely good parathas. The size of the parathas are also really huge and very price worthy. Love the thangdi kabab and be sure to finish an excellent meal with some excellent lassi.
1.0,Been to this place for having dinner. Since it is a small outlet so there is no talk of ambience. You will be getting a bed in the open space to sit and have the food. In the weekend and it will be too much rush. Have to wait for minimum 45 minutes. Coming to the food we have ordered one aloo paratha and one paneer Paratha of queen size. the taste of paneer paratha was ok but the aloo paratha was not at all good. And also ordered the lassi. The taste of lassi was good. Served at perfect temperature but the presentation was not good. Coming to the cleanliness it was ok. The behaviour of staffs were not good and not polite.
5.0,"It's way great experience. The food deserves 5 star rating. Thanks for the suggestion given, we order allu onion and special lassi.  It was great. Thanks a lot."
4.0,"Visiting this place on a weekend, then do go early as the seats get filled quite quickly. Ordered a Aloo Methi paratha king size and 3 Lassi and it was quite filling for 3 people. The paratha was a little hard in the middle but the taste was really good.  Food- 4/5 Service- 4/5 Ambience- 3.5/5"
5.0,Here you will find big north-indian parathas which is very rare in banglore. Mooch marod have different varieties of parathas. You get an option to get paratha cooked in butter or oil. They finally serve it with a big spoon of butter on top of it and a bowl of curd. You can also order lassi.
5.0,Awesome is the word I will say. It's a perfect place to eat if you have love for paratha. Going here for more than 2 years and its a place which provide 100% satisfaction.
5.0,"The place serves huge, really huge parathas in three different sizes. I tried the queen sized aloo pyaaz paratha which was very tasty and definitely worth the money. Had a lassi to end the meal and it was definitely a god experience overall."
5.0,"This place is known for India's biggest paranthe They serve it in three sizes : queen , king and emperor size. Especially serving this type of parantha in Bengaluru is amazing part They have 2 stores : one for veg and the other for non veg. All parantha are well stuffed and served with butter(home-made) , curd, pickle , chutney. Ambience : They have complete dhaba style sitting with charpai in an open. . Huge types of variety are there for lassi and paranthe to choose from. . . You have the option to cook parantha in butter or desi ghee . Think before you order as we ordered 2 queen size parantha and 2 lassi for 3 people and we were actually full. . . Kudos to the mooch marod team  . It's just worth it if you are parantha lover, u will be if u r not.Genuine price as per quality and quantity  ."
5.0,"Visited their Whitefield outlet in weekend! You can anytime see a long queue awaiting on the Khaats( 4 paai) to taste their Parathas.  Lassi- Lassi also served in 3 sizes- King, Queen & Emperor. We tried their Sweet Lassi, Kiwi Lassi & Special Dryfruit lassi. Fingerlicking sweet. You cannot find sweet lassi better than this. #musttry  Taste- Properly cooked and fresh vegetables were used to prepare these parathas. Even green peas were also boiled so that it should not taste raw. I especially loved their green chutney.  Parathas- They serve 3 type of Parathas- King, Queen and Emperor  We ordered king sized aaloo pyaaz paratha and green peas/onion/ gobhi paratha. They also serve green chutney( perfectly grinded & sour) and a big scoooop of home made makhan with each paratha. A bite of aaloo paratha can make anyone happy, pet vich balle balle toh dil vich balle balle!  Ambience- You can experience the pro Punjabi Dhaba style here. In the same commercial complex, they have 2 outlets- Veg & Non veg. You can eat their Giant sized parathas on Charpoy.  Experience- Droolicious. I wud definitely visit their outlet again to feed my hunger pangs.  Price- Not too expensive. Even you can find any of their emperor sized paratha in your budget.  I wonder if 4 Punjabi mushtande can finish their Emperor sized parathas"
5.0,"Mooch Marod - Located at Prashanthi complex, Channasandra Whitefield, Bangalore They have 2 stores in this branch, One is for Veg and Second is for NonVeg.  This place is also known for India Biggest Parathe. This place is for Parathe and Lassi. They have huge varieties of Parathes and Lassi in menu in for both Veg and Non Veg. Ambiance : A small setup with Dhaba style sitting with Charpai and open air .  Parathes: All parathes are well stuffed and served with the Butter, Curd, Chutney and Pickle They have huge options in Parathe where you can select your favorite one. The parathe of size in 3 types Queen, King, and Emperor where you have option to make your parthes in Butter, Oil or Desi Ghee.  Here we tried the Emperor one, and it was extremely big and it was well prepared and cooked. Loved it.  Lassi Delicious lassi also in three types in Queen, King and Emperor with different flavours.  Staff & Service: Price also very economical as per Quality and Quantity Staff will suggest you for the Day special Parathe. Must recommend for the Parathas lover Kudos to Mooch Marod Team"
5.0,"Huge parathas in sizes king and queen! The filling is very generous and a queen paratha can easily suffice two people. The aloo paratha is a standout item here and totally recommended. Also the mooch Marod Lassi is so good. Neither too sweet, nor too heavy! Also tried the kiwi Lassi which will give you fruit feels as the name suggests and is refreshing! Loved the sitting area. You get to sit on a charpai: dhaba style! So,get your gang of friends and family members to make a food journey memorable!"
5.0,This is awesome.. Friendly staff and there is no limit for the taste. We were four and order two queen size mix veg and mattar panner parantha and guess what it was great in taste and shape. People are way too friendly and u will like you are in punjab. A must visit place in your life. Lassi was large and with no compromise on taste.
5.0,"This is the famous place for paratha in Bangalore . They claim to serve the biggest paratha in the world . They have three size for the paratha Queen , King and emperor . We ordered a queen Paratha for two people and it was yummy, delicious , tasty and full fulling for two people . We also tried the pudani chassis and rooh afza lassi . They were just worth it . Do visit the place if you happen to visit here. It's an paneer aloo paratha"
5.0,"This place gives you desi and punjabi vibes. Famous for its giant parathas which comes in size of queen, king and emperor and huge glass of lassi again the size varies smallest comes as the queen size. Freshly made stuffed parantha with white butter is a treat for sure."
5.0,"Amazing parathas available only at this place. Do not have an assumption that you can have one all alone. Not meant for single person dining. Verity of non veg parathas available. We went for Queen size chicken onion keema paratha, which comes with curd and loads of butter and it was more than enough for 2 people. Enjoy the difference in seating arrangement. Great lassi options available as well. King, Queen and Emperor options available.  Must try tangdi kabab, I guess this is the best tangdi kabab in Bangalore. Overall nice experience. Will recommend others to visit once"
5.0,"One of the best restaurant, serving delicious food...king size paratha is really the KING for the restaurant...I'm Lovin It.. Really a great place to check out."
4.0,No comments on their food quality. Its awesome and Im sure that you will love those parathas they offer. Special mention for their home made butter. I could have given 5 starts if they have kept that place hygienic.
3.0,This is good local place to have parathas. Been there twice but the food taste and quality was different on crowded weekend. They serve huge parathas with butter in 3 different size. The place is unusually crowded on weekends even if you go early in the evening. The dining area is open space with Khats for seating.
5.0,A must visit place for paratha lovers. Aloo methi paratha was amazing and chaas also. One queen size paratha is enaf for two people. Non- veg paratha are also available here. Make some free time and visit this place for yummy paratha's.
5.0,A very good spot to fill out us.... Completely Crazy parata good enough lasi...Killahaaa tandoori chicken ultimate hospitality and service are you foodie than you must visit mooch Marod. Good food Good people Good feel.....
5.0,I ordered paratha and lassi. Both are awesome. Its a great place to go. Go with friends and enjoy lassi and huge paratha. #good food Lassi
4.0,"one of the best paranthas in blore. Nice place to hangout with friends. Famous for non-veg but I went for veg paranthas and it was great too. One Queen size parantha is sufficient to feed two. Comes with a big lump of butter , chutney and raitha. Worth the money and pocket friendly"
3.0,"This a place to chill out with friends at some friday night after your hectic schedule of the day. Mooch marod provide a complete dhaba atmosphere with desi khaat to sit and have conversation with friends. Food: The eye catching dish is obviously the huge gigantic parantha for which you would have come here. For a group of 3 people who are like big foodie and so hungry, I would suggest 1 king Sized Aaloo pyaj parantha with 2 glass of queen sized lassi. Take care of the quantity of the food you order else you wont be able to finish it off.  Paranthas are really good and the amount of makkhan added to it adds a desi touch. Talking about lassi, I had Mooch Marod special lassi and it was just okay. I felt that it can be improvised.  Note: If you are visiting here after 9pm during weekends, then chances are you wont be having Paranthas as it will be out of stock and you will also have to wait for an hour for your turn.  #foodiesapien  For food updates and pictures follow me on Instagram : @manishpushkar Subscribe my youtube channel : foodie Sapien https://youtu.be/D0gTGLC7t_A  #foodiesapien"

Nice hospitality, polite n humble n lost importantly helpful host.. Tried their spacial lassi n its just awesome. Waiting time is quite high on weekends but it's worth waiting in every sense"
1.0,"Owner is very very rude. Dont know. how to talk. I guess success went on his head or something. I went and asked for prantha he said paranta are finished. nothing has left he rudely reply with ""Nahi bola na samgh ni aata kya"". I will never visit that place. Seriously even i won't recommend you also."
5.0,"Polite and friendly. Delicious paratha with awesome lassi.  The most important thing I like about this place is service , staff and lassi. I love it"
5.0,"The place is very good to have food you will get three size Queen,King& emperor. I have was queen size which was pretty good Taste was awesome .The person working was also very friendly Highly recommend if you are in Bangalore do visit here"
5.0,One of the best place to have best parathas. Properly stuffed end to end with lots of white butter which is almost impossible to get in Bangalore.. nice n supportive n suggestive host who help us to decide orders. Really satisfied with the service n experience at mooch marod. Don't forget to try their special lassi
5.0,"I had heard about this place from my friends and wanted to try it especially after the disappointment from other fellow North Indian places. Intrigued by the size of parathas they serve we went their and ordered their Queen size Aloo pyaz matar paratha and a regular size Paneer matar paratha. We also ordered two regular size lassi.  The parathas were spot on. It was what a North Indian would want. The Parathas had generous amount of stuffing and hence had the right balance between the stuffing and the Atta. Moreover, the huge size of parathas didnt have any negative effect on the taste. The parathas were served with dahi, achaaa, chutney and homemade white butter which was heavenly (cant believe it was my first time I had white butter!). The dahi has good consistency. The lassi was quite heavy on out tummys.  They have a dhaba like seating which cannot accommodate large number of customers. But they serve the best parathas in Bangalore."
5.0,Maze ki baat toh yeh h ki..3 lassi toh main khud hi pee gya..upar se 2 king size parathe....try it..itna pyaara unhone paratha banaya jee kare khaata rahoon..

5.0,Place where you get home made paratha. Feels like proper taste of haryana paratha. Lassi and chaas were delicious. Alooo onion paratha was delicious.
5.0,"Well well! Went there with a friend who recommended this place to us and I was mighty surprised. I have never been a high end foodie but I am completely happy having gone to Indian accent. Though the price is on the higher side, the experience and taste completely justifies it."

5.0,"Hello everyone, Today ill share my personal review about this place.  I have visited this place only one time but Ill say that if you are a parantha lover then this is actually a bestb place for you.  Its a best place for pure vegeterian as they only serve different types of veg paranthas.  I have ordered a parantha their and it was good, they took around 10 minutes to prepare it but they made it with proper hygiene.  Here is my rating which will give you guys a little bit of idea about this place."
5.0,Awesome paranthe. Yummy taste and not too much costly. If you are passing through these paranthas are a must try.I must say each and every thing was superbly made. Moolie parantha is the best.
5.0,Good for decent street food. If you are a 'paratha' lover you will like this place. Hygiene and ambience need to be improved. However I rate this place better than many Paratha shops nearby.
5.0,"To good and very big, we 2 was Emperor in 1 queen paratha, I recommend for those who want party with friends much visit. The Parantha offered by restaurant is at good and affordable price . Also quality and balance of amount of stuffing is very goo"

5.0,Delicious Food and Ambience. Taste and food quality is as same as one year before  I love the parathas of mooch marod.... I usually visit here on weekends with my friends.
5.0,We ordered a aaloo pyaaz Paratha and a lassi.. Amazing Paratha  true to the name.. zabardast desi  Will definitely come again.. a nice desi food place in Whitefield desert

5.0,"Full of taste, quality, quantity, variety... A heaven for paratha lovers... Typical north Indian flavor... Superb.. Excellent service, amazingly managed by our Rohtak's man..."
5.0,"One of the best places and must visit in Bangalore. If you love North Indian paranthe, then this place is one to be in the list for sure. Must try their challenges, which I think are a fun way to justify your overeating, because you are probably not going to win those challenges"
1.0,"They serve monstrously big Paratha and that is end of anything good about this place. This has to be one of the most dirty and filthy place to eat in Bangalore. Bangalore is a place where Darshinis maintain very good hygiene. So it is kind of surprising that this place has such poor standards when it comes to cleanliness. Fleas were abundant and kitchen was repulsive to look at while eating. Such high rating for this eatery is injustice to good restaurants in Bangalore. Probably the ratings has more to do with nostalgia of people from northern part of India rather the quality of food. Recreating dhaba does not mean recreating filth. Everything is erratic here. During afternoon you have to sit in sunlight as hardly any shade for cots. Wooden planks kept on Cots were greasy with generous serving of fleas on them, Cots were dirty as well. In fact most prominent feature of this place is filth. As a society we dont demand cleanliness and probably thats why all our streets are dirty and restaurants like Mooch Marod can get away with such high ratings.  Coming to food, we waited 45 minutes for our paratha and I could squeeze litres of oil out of that paratha. Sorry this is not the memory of paratha I have. Taste was ok, nothing extraordinary.   Cost wise its ok, 200 rupees per head is all you need to spend to fill your stomach. I had diarrhea after eating here and all the money saved went to doctor is another story.  Ambience: I dont have anything to write which I have not written. Owners tried to recreated dhaba inside a city and I think they have failed at it. You dont need to go further then Sher-e-Punjab on Hoskote road to see how a dhaba looks like.   Summary: Avoid if you can. If you love generous amount of filth with your food then this is your place."
5.0,"Best place to hang out with friends with big stomach. Amazing food... Best in taste , hygne, good customer service... Money worth..beat part is veg is separate and nonveg is separate.."
5.0,Awesome place with zabardast paratha.....this far the best in town. Strongly recommend for all the paratha lovers. Jigra chehye king size ya emperor size paratha khatam Karne
5.0,"Ek number. Paisa vasool. The best paratha experience in Bangalore. Doston ke saath jaao, 2-3 king size parathe thooske aao. Best in taste, hygne, behavior with customer and everything nice"
5.0,One of the best paratha house in bangalore... Parathas are huge and will tickle your taste buds... Don't forget to check out their koramangala outlet as well
1.0,When u prosper it doesn't mean u leave ur customers behind.I was a regular customer until I found out the behaviour of the owner is the worst of its kind. Never would recommend to anyone.Pathetic ..worst of its kind
1.0,Behaviour of staff very rude as well as hygiene concern. Parathas are normal only thing make it special is butter. Sitting arrangement doesnt suit to old people. If few people in your group wants to eat nonveg they have to sit another side.
4.0,Dhaba like atmosphere. Place serves some of the best parathas I have ever had. Also the quantity is huge. Great service. No issue with the pricing either. Definitely recommended.
5.0,The mooch marod restro have good quality of food & excellent service you fell like as home food quality space family environment. All services are good love u Mooch Marod thank you mooch marod staff for your prompt service

5.0,I arrived Banglore from jaipur & landed directly to mooch marod as i was too hungry. Ambience was good. Quantity & taste was good staff was courteous & delivered food to my table in less than 10 minutes. Overall best.
5.0,At mooch marod it will be a pocket friendly deal if u visit this place. Food quality and quantity is extremely good. One thing i like most here is paratha.
5.0,Mooch Marod is best restro in my fav list. They are both veg & non veg. Good food with good service at mooch marod. Ambience is good & spacious place. Rates are economic.
5.0,I had good dining experience here with my family. They are pure vegetarian. Quantity of the food is very good & taste is also very good. Overall good restro.
5.0,Polite n humble host. Be there always in group as they also says eating together is healthy n fun.. Having paratha n lassi at mooch marod is always fun. Waiting is slightly high but worth the wait. Finally a destination in bangalore for awesome paratha n lassi
2.0,"The parathas served here are pretty average just bigger in size. However the butter served with the paratha is delicious. We ordered a aaloo gobi peas paratha to be made in butter but the paratha which came to us was definitely cooked in refined oil inspite of having paid extra for a butter paratha. The ambience here is quite interesting with the charpais adding a rustic feel to the place. Another good thing is that the parathas are made fresh, which is not really a surprise after having waited 1 hour for it. The attitude of the staff is quite careless. The major problem I have with this place is that they don't give a bill. This place is just overhyped but you can go there once just for the experience of having a humongous paratha on a charpai. If that's what you are looking to do with your free time. I however felt that it was not worth my time or money. I have had better parathas which were better served even if they were a little smaller in size and guess what I left the place much happier and with a justified price tag and s proper bill."
5.0,"Polite n humble owner n staff. Their paratha r not just big un size, these r big in taste as well. Proper stuffed paratha n proper cooked with nice n crisp with white butter on the top.. What else u need in North Indian paratha. These guys offer discount to defence personnel.. Huge respect for mooch marod for this"
4.0,"I visited this place on recommendation of a friend. I liked the concept of larger paratha. Taste was very good. Sitting arrangement is different (cots), which gives a different experience. One best part is separate kitchen fir veg and non veg food. Service is slow at it take long time. Owner behavior is polite but he did not listened to the customers. I had some concern about sitting arrangement, but he did listened to that."
5.0,Best paratha that i have tried in bangalore. Awesome taste and food quality. People coming in group should definitely try the emperor. The paratha we ordered was mixed veg king size and it was sufficient for 2 person. Will be back soon to try emperor.
3.0,"Mooch Marod.  An excellent effort at trying to recreate a typical North Indian highway eating post (dhaba). Outdoor seating with cots, open tandoor, and a restaurant owner donning the look of a ""truck-walah"" go a long way in creating a close to authentic experience. Though the fact that it is located in a market complex offsets some of the effort.  When it comes to service, it is quite erratic. Some items appear early, some (like the lassi) at times could even come after your meal.  They have tried to create a novelty by dishing out larger than life parathas, which works well as their usp. Queen size parathas should be sufficient for two average hungry souls (I can eat one on my own though).  Now, the kind of filling you decide on can significantly alter your experience, and I guess this is one aspect this place might want to improve on.  Aloo Onion is my favourite, and I feel has always been consistent. Mutton Keema was nice as well. Chicken Keema surprisingly, was a bit too dry. We also tried a filling with peas, which felt a bit too dry as well.  Starters are good, and we tried the malai tikka and the bhajias. Both were fine.  Lassi here is a bit too sweet, and the standard one has a texture similar to diluted srikhand. But, you can't really have paratha without lassi right, so might as well go for it, but the smallest glass at that.  I do recommend this place, since it is a relatively exciting option compared to the monotony of the Whitefield north indian scene.  Service: 2/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Food: 3.5/5 Value for Money: 3.5/5  P.S: I wish Zomato brings back its old rating system - this place fits just perfectly for a 3.5/5 !"
5.0,Loved the experience here. Small paratha outlet with lots of variety of paratha and lassi. Tried once 3 months back and now every week it's a must go place for me.. they do offer discount to army people as well. Huge respect for Indian army and to mooch marod as well as they are doing good in every sense .
5.0,Heard a lot about this place from so many people. Finally I'm here.. First impact is just dhaba which is very good. Putted cots under stars is giving a nice n fresh feel. Small food outlet always jam packed every time. Coming to the food. Serving huge paratha with white butter on the top n a lot of butter. After a very long time I had such nice paratha. Owner is always there to welcome you with his smile n sense of humor which you won't find in any restaurant which makes this outlet even more better. He is so helpful n guide you about every thing.. One word is just awesome.
3.0,Been there on a weekday to try the famous huge parathas we were a group of 10 people and order 2 non veg and 1 veg paratha and a plate of kaha. Loved the veg paneer peas paratha but the chicken paratha could be better and I really hope that they manage their time because 1 veg paratha took more than 90 minutes. Loved the lassi that they serve.
5.0,"After heard about this place, we decided to go for dinner.... Nd it was really great experience i just loved it... Mooch marod is an authentic parantha place in Bangalore which serves biggest nd Tastiest prantha.. plus they have varieties of lassi which was just wow.... if you're a north Indian then u will like the interior and sitting arrangements also.. I recommend this place to every parantha lover. #must try #mooch_marod"
2.0,"The taste was good and affordable, but place is not that hygiene and very less space to accumulate many people .Have to sit in hot sun if no places are there"
5.0,"The best place to have a paratha in Bangalore. Heard about the place from a friend, and travelling to this place for around 10 kms was worth the penny."
4.0,"The food here is definitely good, the parathas are quiet good (specially if you like not very spicy food) and the lassi is quiet authentic as well. Do keep in mind the smallest size is sufficient for 2 people. And the biggest size is sufficient for a small group...although its not available from friday to sunday. One thing they could probably improve is the seating area/arrangement. When we visited there were quiet many flies. For seating there are only cots, and its in open so if its sunny/hot...could be a problem in day time."
4.0,It has a good concept of eating together on the same plate! The parathas are big enough that at leasttwo people are needed to eat a King size paratha!A good number of varieties are there and it also tastes good. A nice place to hang out with your friends over parathas.
5.0,If your going the first time...theres every chance that youll struggle to find the place. But youll forget the pain once you start eating. The parathas here are awesome! We were 7 of us - ordered 2king and 1 queen (as recommended by the owner of the place) along with a bucket of lassi plus three 1 litre glasses of their special lassi. Waited for one hour for the food. We were famished by the time it came. Trust me...was worth the wait! We polished off everything! I dont think anyone of us will eat dinner. The makkhan portion was also generous- just as the way theyd serve it in Punjab. Will I go back? Guess the answer is obvious.
5.0,The Parathas were too yummy.... You'll surely get to fell the Punjabi essence. Just the waiting time is a bit of a problem but again then it's worth it
4.0,"Lovely food. Amazing paranthas and heart-ful of lassi. Paranthas are available in every possible combination and the best part there are different outlets for veg and non-veg paranthas. We thought of ordering two, but we're advised to take one first. Very nice advice. So we ordered queen size peas onion parantha and Mango lassi. More than enough for two. Love the sitting arrangement which leaves with a rustic rural feeling. Am striking off one point for for hygiene - definitely there is a room for lot of improvement. Sitting place should be cleaned as soon as the guest leaves and the hand washing area should be kept clean and maintained."
5.0,Had heard lot about this place so finally got a chance to visit this place. Best place in Bangalore if u like stuffed parathas with loads of butter nd raita. Ambiance was good.
3.0,"This was one of my long pending place to go. Went there with my family. Ordered two queen size, methi paneer and gobi with four different types lassi for each one. Waiting time was 1hr 15mins. Sitting arrangement was on a charpai, which was nice: 4/5. Host was really nice person: 5/5. Cleanliness was average 3/5. While waiting for paratha, ordered some tangdi kabab, which was really good:5/5. After long time (may be first time in Bangalore) had stuffed tangdi kabab. But paratha was a below expectation. Stuffing lacked the spices. I would rate 3/5. Forget Amritsar, I had better paratha in Bangalore. I wouldn't give any extra brownie point for size."
4.0,"Personally Im not a fan of stuff paratha only as a dinner. But, lemme tell you, this place is just serving best parathas in town. Being foodie myself, I have never enjoyed parathas ( Paneer mutter and Aloo onion mutter).  And the size, my goodness!! We went as a group of four people and couldnt finish just 2 queen size parathas!! ( lemme tell you queen is smallest size you get here)   The owner is very friendly and will definitely help you to order wisely!! He will suggest not to order more at start and order as you need it. Who does that in bangalore( people will just look for money)  Just as a small suggestion, being a vegetarian myself, it would be great if handwash facility is provided in vegetarian section too. As its uncomfortable for vegetarian to go to non-veg section to wash their hands.   Good job paaji, tussi chaa gaye!!"
5.0,This place is perfect for paratha lovers who are missing north Indian style paratha. Huge paratha with home made butter makes it totally mind blowing. Lassie is going very well with the paratha. Kudos mooch marod
4.0,"I had heard of this place since a long long time. Hadn't gone until today only because it is situated in Whitefield. Finally considering it was a Friday and long weekend will follow, I decided to to have my dinner here.  Took some finding the place. It is situated in the khaugali type area opposite Apollo pharmacy. When we looked at the menu, I didn't realise what the hype was all about. I thought theree people, three paratha would suffice. When we asked the owner there he looked at us and said 1 Queen size or if you really want to put an effort than 1 King size. I being ""I"" adventurous decided to go for two queen size in butter along with two glass of special Lassi.  I guess the word queen size is extremely misleading as one paratha was I believe enough for 3-4 PPL on an average day. The paratha tastes good when it is piping hot. After first 15 20 minutes once they become cold, it stops tasting delicious. Partly because your stomach is full, partly because the taste is getting repeative and party because the paratha has gone cold. We had ordered the aaloo methi paneer and aaloo onion paratha. I like the aaloo methi paneer more.  I guess the lesson here should be to check with the owner before ordering! Overall I had a good time! Only hope is turn Tommorow morning, everything is in peace and in normality :)"
3.0,The Aloo Paratha and Lassi you get here is the best money can buy for you. The only concern is hygiene and the time for each order to be processed. The wait time on a busy day could be easily over 45 minutes. I wish they had a better way for controlling the traffic by reservations or expanding. Also there are a lot of flies around the area and they don't seem to give this a lot of attention even after being asked to
4.0,"Finally we had a chance to eat some delicious Parathas. In our first visit we didn't get the chance to eat because crowd was huge and food was finished.  But yeah this time we get our order after 40-45 minutes. We ordered Aloo Gobhi, Aloo Methi and Paneer Paratha and size was queen. We also tried Rose Lassi and Plain Lassi.  Taste was really nice and simple. I personally don't like Paneer Paratha because it was very bland in taste. My favorite paratha was Aloo Methi. But you will not find spicy taste at all. Stuffing was in good amount but in the center you will taste more flour not filling.  Lassi was super delicious and that white butter on paratha was icing on the cake. Overall nice experience."
1.0,"Somehow not comfortable experience, ,............  Atmosphere attitude offerings gesture are not friendly, visited this place with lots of recommendation and expectations probably thats why experience mismatch"
5.0,Awesome concept of large parathas.... Tasty.... Awesome range of varieties.... The waiting time in peak hours is a bit tiring but worth for the food they serve
4.0,"This is THE PLACE FOR BEST PARATHAS IN BANGALORE. People keep asking me about the best place with best parathas in Bangalore and my answer is only this. Very unique restaurant and loved it. The paneer starter was also very very good here, and parathas were just too good. The king size is enough for three people with very good appetite."
4.0,Best place for paratha in Whitefield.  They serve best what they offer.  This place has open outdoor seating with dhabha ambiance. Feel free to go in your track pants or loose trousers.  Parathas start from queen size to king size. Queen size itself is huge. I doubt if a single person can finish this. The taste is amazing. Parathas are properly filled and cooked.  We were three and ordered chicken paratha -queen size and lassi.  Staff is good but service is slow. Please check before going if parathas are available or not.  Food-5/5 Ambiance-3.5/5 Service-4/5
1.0,very bad attitude of the staff.. no proper arrangement. abusive owner and bad testing food too.. never visit unless you want to experience a nightmare.
4.0,"Go there. Sit on a cot. Order your Paratha. Be amused with its size and amazed by its taste. ; Afghani chicken is good. For the price point, its a must visit."
5.0,This place totally redefines the word paratha. Here they serve delicious food with overwhelming service and love. I salute them for their respect towards indian army. Great thought and keep up this attitude guys. You made me your fan.
3.0,I went to Mooch Marod with my office colleagues for lunch as we were craving for some authentic North Indian paranthas. This place has a decent seating with old fashioned Khaats. I ordered a queen size Aaloo Onion parantha which was awesome. But the person who was attending us was very rude so he spoiled the whole mood. I asked if we could get normal water instead of packaged bottles to which the person started cribbing about the water supply in the area and all sort of excuses and his tone was very rude.  All in all the food is good but the rude behavior spoiled the lunch for us.  I would rate the restaurant 4 star for food. And 2 star for service.  I'm sure you guys would be doing great business but if you don't know how to treat your customers then you wont go far.
3.0,"3* only for the dhaba like set up ,lassi n starter v ordered. Parantas though come in different size n their concept is very new (king/queen n emperor size) they lack taste. I went to this place after reading the reviews ..but disappointed.."
5.0,"The variety of Paratha they offer is very amazing. The sizes varies in king, queen. If you take any king size 4 people will be easily having it and you will feel full. Lassi is also very nice . When we visited that place, we waited for around 1 hr as we visited in weekend but it was really worth it. Must visit place if you have love for punjabi food, tandoori items and parathas. Seating arrangement will also make you feel like you are at proper dhaba."
5.0,"Okay, this place is amazing. Really amazing. I have never tasted such delicious parathas in bangalore! The parathas are cooked well with good portion of the stuffing. The crust is crispy and stuffing has the perfect blend of flavours. This place serves the parathas with homemade white butter.  The ambience is simple and authentically dhaba like.  Visiting the place again soon!"
5.0,"Woohooo !! This is the best place to have parathas!! Sitting on a khatayi, having a super large size garam paratha with a glass of lassi accompanied by such a great and humble service  perfect!"
5.0,I heard about this place 3 month ago and was dying to be there.. I visit the place on last Sunday and it was amazing.. I and my friends enjoyed the the big pratha while talking to owners of the place. We loved it so mch that we went there again to enjoy the Emporer pratha. The people working there are so loving. And best part is that there were two separate kitchen for veg and non veg parathas. Luv the food as well as people.. Love to be there again. Delhi wale h hum...
4.0,Very nice parathas.. pocket friendly.. fulfilling to the core . The guy at the counter was very helpful..Little more visibility in terms of a board etc will really help for people to notice the place .
5.0,"This place should be in the bucket list of all paratha lovers. There are two outlets one veg and other non veg facing each other. We went to the non veg outlet.  That say India's biggest Paratha and they mean it. We were 3 friends and ordered king size anagara chicken keema onion paratha and their special bucket lassi. One king size paratha is sufficient for 3 ppl considering 2 of us were big eaters. Paratha was prepared in butter and they served it with authentic makhan. I was drooling over the way makhan was melting on the hot paratha. Not only the paratha was gigantic, it was very yummy. Nd their humongous bucket of lassi was amazing. It was a very nice and an unique experience."
5.0,The place was super. That authenticity was great. The people were so good and there was no duplicacy. Really loved the place and can visit again and again. Kudos to the restaurant. The special lassi was awesome too.
4.0,"Be ready to wait, because this place is extremely crowded. The seating is outside on khataiis, I'm a bit on the heavier side so it wasn't very comfortable for me. The food is brilliant. We had the kheema paratha, and some of the kebabs, they were great, and easy on the pocket. Place your order when you arrive, and have your food served when you get a table. Would visit again."
4.0,Awesome parathas and lassi. Really enjoyed the food. Definitely visit the place. Waiting periods are high because parathas take a while to cook and also depends on the amount of crowd.
5.0,"Yumm!! One of the best paratha places in Bangalore.  A must visit place for people who crave for a perfect dhaba style paratha. But make sure that you go with a gang or hulk like appetite as this place serves everything in king size. The seating style and the ambience here will definitely give you a proper dhaba feel.  Parathas are available in 3 sizes: Queen (equal to 4 parathas approx), King (equal to 7-8 parathas approx) and Emperor (equal to 10-12 parathas approx). Lassi and Chaas are served in 750ml or 1L or 2L bucket. So plan to visit this place with a proper bhukkad gang.  We had Mix veg paratha (6/5) and Mooli & Onion paratha (4/5) along with Jeera Chaas (5/5) and Pudina Chaas (4/5). Both the parathas were requested to be cooked in butter and Queen size (the least in the lot; which is equal to 4 regular parathas). Parathas are served with Raita, Pickle and chutney. The chutney is spicy and way too delicious.  My friends had Queen size Mutton keema paratha cooked with butter and they loved it to the core. They had sweet lassi which they loved it.  Ambience - 4/5 Cost to quality - 5/5 Taste - 5/5 Service - 5/5  I would love to rate this place 4.5/5 but not anything less. As Zomato has removed fractional rating, I rated it 5/5"
5.0,"Had heard a lot about this place and badly wanted to give it a try.  Went once on a Sunday night and they they said wait time is one and half hour so went back.  Went again on a Sunday afternoon, wait time was 1 hour, so we did wait as its very far for me and went there just for that.  We were four and not sure how much to order, they were very helpful in assessing how much we should order. So we got two queen sized aloo pyaaz parathas, 3 queen lassis n 1 shahi lassi.  Loved their idea of people sitting together and eating in one plate and socializing offline.  Coming to the taste, it was lip smacking good, I played safe and ordered aloo pyaaz, the stuffing was very good. The huge amount of butter, Dahi n pickle made it even better.   We got extra butter, which was again served in huge quantity with a big smile.  Even though we had to wait for an hour in the scorching sun, the taste and the hearty service would make it worth it!!!  Coming to prices, based on the size of paratha and amount of butter its definitely fair. The big glass of lassi @90 is fine too, but shahi lassi @190, more than double of the normal dint seem fair.  Overall a great experience, would love to again for sure!  Ambience: 3.5/5 Service: 4/5 Food: 5/5 Price: 4.5/5  P.S: I would request them to add one more pan and try to reduce the wait times n cater to more ppl."
5.0,"I just love the paratha, lassi, chicken and the way they serve there customer with love, with sweet smile and humbleness. True punjabis damn osum place. #goodforfriends #goodforfamily #Noalcoholatall #pyaarwalanasha #highwithfood"
5.0,The best dhaba experience in Bangalore.. Amazing paranthas with asli makhan and lassi. Super delicious and huge portions. Not to mention the chutneys and achar
4.0,"A fantastic place for dinner with your buddy, Come here when your gang want to come out to sit together under sky and wanna feel semi dhaba type ambiance, since they have sitting arrangement at cot, than this place is perfect.We ordered one King size paneer aaloo onion paratha, and one king size kesar lassi, we were three and this was enough for us and paratha was tasty enough and worth to drive till there. They served both veg and non veg paratha, and the beauty is, that they have two different shop for them and one opposite other."
4.0,"Bring you bhukkad(hungry animal) out ...because here you gonna get damn tasty and Indian biggest Parantha. They have 2 branches opposite to each other. One serves Veg Parantha and other one serves Non-Veg Parantha.  The shop is small but they have large space outside for people to sit. They places lot of cots(Khatiya) where you can have parantha with full desi feel.  If you planning to have Parantha here then reach atleast 30-40 minutes early. Because you might need to wait over 30 minutes after placing order. And ya ...You will get seat only when cot is empty and your order is already placed.  We were group of 6 people and as we saw the size of parantha so we ordered only 2 small size Parantha and 2 Lassi for us. You might be laughing ...2 parantha and 2 lassi for 6 people. Queen parantha is 20 inch in size with heavy filling and Homemade(white butter) in bulk on it and small Lassi is of 750 ml each. Got shock right. Welcome to Mooch Marod   Ya they have competetion too...If alone you finish 2 Emperor Size Parantha(24-25 inch) and 1 Lassi in 1 hour then you win Rs 5000. Still they are looking for first winner.  And they give 15% discount to army people, if they show their ID card and 20% discount, if they come in army dress. I liked it very much..that they are doing something for our army as a gratitude  Respect.  We ordered :- Aloo Parantha - Best Parantha. Awesome taste with great filling and lot of homemade butter. Got feeling of homemade parantha as my mom used to prepare. Exact same taste. Parantha was properly prepared. It was not raw from any side. Loved it.  Paneer and Green Peas Parantha - It was also great in taste. And served with lot of butter and pickle like other one.  Sweet Lassi - Taste was good. Like it very much. But it can be better if malai is more thick.  In comparison we liked Aloo Parantha more than Paneer Parantha.  Staff is busy all the time as rush is always there. But atleast if they greet the customer well it will be great. They have lil ego ...That their place will run whether they talk to customer nicely or not. This thing doesn't take business to heights.  Overall experience was great in terms of food."
5.0,"If you are a paratha lover, this place is a must. They serve amazing parathas both tatse and quantity cannot be matched elsewhere . The royal lassi is also amongst one of its speciality. They have two seatings one for vegetarians other for non vegetarians. The staff is extremely courtoeus and friendly. They also give 20 percent off to the army personnel that again was commendable. Amazing food . Planning to visit soon again"
1.0,Went to this place after getting recommended by a friend. Size of parantha is big but still smaller than managers ego. Super rude service provided and yes order will take 45 - 60 mins. So may you have luck eating out at this place!
5.0,One of the best place to have nice paratha & lassi. Loads of butter & big size of paratha. This place is not for them who are more into ambience or want to eat individually. Staff is very polite. Charpai under the stars gives you feel. The only thing I was concern about is the wastage of food as they make such big parathas but I really appreciate when I come to know that there is no wastage at all. They either ask customer to parcel the leftover. If customer don't want to take it then they serve the leftover to the homeless guys around. Which makes this place even more better. Kudos Mooch Marod
2.0,"Had heard of this place through a friend and mostly about its parathas. Reached out on Friday evening to try it out.  Place has dhaba type seating arrangement on charpai. Veg & non-veg sections are separate. Veg section has only Parathas & lassi.  The attitude of the staff is like they are serving free food. All the polite requests were straight away rejected. We were two families with 3 kids but they did not cared about that.  We ordered 2 parathas and 2 medium lassi. While ordering we told that we want very less oil on parathas, the person said thats not possible instead you can go for butter with extra charges. I told whether it is oil or butter, we want it to be very less. Initially he was hesitant but later agreed saying he will try. But when parathas arrived they were heavily covered in oil. We did not wanted to waste so we used tissue paper to remove the excess oil.   As we had children we asked for extra plate but they refused saying that they don't give extra plate nor they will give any extra glass for lassi. One glass of lassi was 1 litre and you don't have any ways to share. This was really unheard of in any kind of restaurant.   They might want to say that they want people to eat together but you cannot force others to eat together in one plate and one glass. That too when there are multiple families and children.  Now coming to the quality or quantity, I would say quantity of 2 queen size parathas was more than enough for 4 adults and 3 kids. Quality if I have to say - nothing great as we prepare much better parathas at home with quality ingredients. But compared to regular dhabas in Bangalore, this was kind of ok.  Coming to lassi, we took their special lassi where while taking order they told they put dry fruits and lot of stuff. But what we got was plain lassi with some kind of dryfruit syrup(thandai) only. Lassi was being prepared using Thirumala curd packets. Tasted just like any other lassi in Bangalore & no where compared to lassi what we get in north india.  Personally I feel that such a big size paratha cause lot of wastage & forced eating. Lets say we order paratha with some filling and once we start eating we don't like, we don't have a choice but to either eat un-wantingly or throw it away. Instead having smaller parathas gives us better choice.  I can say that this place can be tried once just to have an experience of extravaganza. I would not like to come again."
5.0,"What an amazing place to have authentic Punjabi parathas, in Bangalore.  This place claims to serve the largest parathas in India. The smallest size being queen sized and the largest is Emperor sized.  We ordered their ""smallest"" sized, queen parathas. Each of these can be eaten by 3 to 4 guys. Provided each guy is hungry and passionate to gave authentic parathas.  They serve with a big chunk of pure butter and Raitha.  We were 8 of us who could have 4 different flavored vegetarian parathas. Aloo Onion, aloo peas, paneer parathas were just yummy.  They serve different flavors of thick yummy lassi. They serve in a bucket, which are sized 1 liter to 2 liter.  But we just took 2 glasses of lassi. The standard sweet lassi. It was out of the world. Damn good ones. Each glass is easily 750ml.  They serve the guests on charpai, just like a dhabha.  The best part is, they have 2 outlets opposite to each other, segregated as vegetarian and non-vegetarian.  A must visit place to all the parathas lovers."
1.0,Very poor service..being a regular customer can feel the degradation in the quality of food..employees are too rude...not at all satisfied with either the behaviour and the service..drastic downfall
5.0,The best parantha and lassi in the world...Visiting the place was not just eating and coming back rather it was a memory of a lifetime...i would surely visit mooch marod soon..hungry for more
5.0,Came here after an instant plan. The size of the paratha was crazy and the taste was super awesome. Do visit here to make your tongue orgasm with super delicious tasty parathas and lassi. The ambience and setup is the standout quality. A must must try..!!
5.0,"#FoodHub#FoodPorn#FoodLove#MLovingIt. We tried the Paratha for the first time today night and the food was great, freshly cooked very tasty and well presented. ... Overall a good meal and great value we will certainly be going back. ..."
5.0,"By chance discovered this place and it turned to be very awesome. Good quality , awesome taste , desi anadaz. One must try atleast once in Bangalore."
1.0,I have visited this place several times and the paratha used to be very good. But today was different. The paratha was very oily that oil was literally dripping. The taste was also bitter. Hygiene of the place also has gone down. Pickle and pudina chutney is offered in small jars. The jar was so filthy that it seemed like it has never been cleaned. Really disappointed with this place.
5.0,Paranthas could not have tasted much better!! One of the best places to enjoy delicious paranthas of North India in Bangalore.. Go there and enjoy your meal with a glass of lassi.  PS :- always go with 2-3 person. You will not be able to finish anything alone.
5.0,"To be honest, it was a chance discovery. And when I found a tiny fragment of authentic Punjab in Bangalore, I was flabbergasted. The ambience is perfectly set with they letting you sit on khatias and serving food the punjabi dhaba way. Veg and non veg counters are separate allowing less clutter and confusion. A queen size paratha is enough for two folks. We had the Afghani chicken stuffed paratha which was beautiful and the ghee they cooked in made it taste even better. Service: 5\5 Food Quality and Taste: 5/5 Creativity: 5/5 Ambience:5/5 A must visit. I am going again tonight...see you there"
3.0,This place is mainly for the experience of having India biggest paranthas . The taste of the paranthas is average . The filling in paranthas is not properly distributed mainly in the centre there will be no filling . So visit this place try there paranthas click some photos for insta .
4.0,"This was my first visit to Mooch Marod and its like Punjab in Bangalore. The road side market is where Mooch Marod is situated about 1km from hope farm junction. the Ambience, the Creativity, Food they offer, Seating arrangement all in all an amazing north India dhaba experience. The Parantha comes in 3 sizes The Queen  20 inch, The King  22 inch and The Emperor  24 inch. The queen size parantha (multiple varieties) is sufficient for a family of 3 taking into account lassi (multiple varieties). They offer Pranthas both Veg and Non Veg. Now coming to the taste, I will say there is a lot of room for improvement. Aloo, Gobi and Onion Parantha could get some spice and a bit more stuffing. The Palak, Paneer, Onion Parantha is good with the right amount of stuffing. Both these dishes are not spicy and weigh less on spice and white butter kills all the spice thats left off. The Mutton Kheema Parantha is with right amount of stuffing and cooked well. Again not spicy and can get some spice into it. Mutton Sheek Kebab is good, cooked well, right spice, good texture and right colour."
5.0,"I went there with my family. It's a good place to be. They have cots for sitting and eating. Parathas are just awesome. Different varieties and great taste. The amount of unsalted butter and lassi was good. At first, we thought if it is possible for us to finish this but, once you start eating, you will want more. It's a unique and different experience all together. We all should experience that.."
5.0,"INIDIA'S LARGEST PRANTHAS OUTLET            Giving the feel of Amristar in Banglore.....what else do North Indians want? :DThis place completely gives you feel of Amritsar. . . The pavement, the structure of the market where Mooch Marod is situated, the food they offer, the seating arrangement. Must visit place for north Indians and South People too if they wanna taste the food of North, especially pranthas.P.S It is not usual for north Indians to eat the pranthasof the size which Mooch Marod offers. :DThey have, in general 3 sizes, Small Medium Large. I guess it goes like 20 inch, 22inch and 24inch.  And one 20inch pranthais enough of 2 people, considering the average appetite level of person.They offer variety of Pranthas, both Veg and Non Veg. You can try any item and definitely you'llnot regret having it. We ordered 1 Aalo Prantha and 1 sweet lassi. Even 1 lassiglass wasenough for 2 people. Staff : 5/5 Ambience : You are supposed to sit outside but you will definitely enjoy especially with the banglore weather. Food : 5/5 Uniqueness : 5/5 Creativity : 5/5"
4.0,"Value for money - 4 ( Parathas could be a bit cheaper ,lassi for sure was over priced ) Ambience - 3 ( didn't care much about it though ) Taste -5 Quantity -5 ( we struggled to finish last few bites of our King Size Paratha )  Overall - 4 .Best to good with family or large groups!  We went on a Saturday and had to wait for an hour and There veg Parathas were sold out by 9:30 pm ,so go early if u want to wait less and enjoy the Parathas"
5.0,One of the biggest paratha in Bangalore is prepared here. Must visit place to have variety of paratha both vegetarian and non vegetarian. Only issue is the time to prepare the order is quite more.
5.0,"Wonderful food. Basic dhaba style ambiance. Food portion is large. Smallest portions are enough for two person. Huge parathas come topped with a dollop of butter, accompanied with curd and pickle.  Food was hygienic but some personal hygiene would be appreciated. There was no soap with hand wash and khats had food droppings. I hope they have plans to expand. On a weekend the wait time was long because space was limited"
4.0,"The location is a bit far from the main road, they have a typical dhaba Ambience, with separate kitchen and seating for vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Seating is on a charpai, they could have made arrangements for some shade.   They have very huge sizes of paratha. Queen being the smallest, it is big enough to serve three people. We tried the paneer peas onion paratha, two of us could barely finish it. Achaar and green chutney are kept on the table. The paratha come see with a large amount of butter and raitha. We also had their smallest size sweet lassi and salt lassi. Would Definitely recommend going for the sweet lassi, there was excess salt in Salt Lassi.   Overall we had a great time, go for the jumbo sized paratha and the large lassi experience. It's not too expensive, it would be ideal to go in groups of more than three people.  Ambience : 3/5 Food : 4/5 Service : 4/5"
4.0,I love parathas this place has biggest parathas in bangalore city. The size of parata are amazing and its location it to little far and most lovely things is non veg pararha chicken keema was awesome
5.0,"This is the best place to have paratha in Bangalore, and when I say paratha one person can only eat one. We 3 had a single Paneer Babycorn King Paratha with delicious Raita and load of fresh butter. Also a big glass of Lassi, they have many options for both parathas and Lassi. You will get a proper Delhi taste of parathas and Lassi there. Owners attitude is great with customers and service is also upto the mark, there is a waiting time though as the demand is high and they only serve fresh parathas. The restaurant is not too big but the Parathas are..."
1.0,The manager here doesn't respect its customers. Their paranthas are sold out even one hour before they claim. They don't even talk properly. The way they treat their customers is beyond pathetic. Never going back here.
5.0,"Just awesome. Only one word can explain this. Nice food, sitting under open sky covered with stars. One of the best hospitality. You will really feel like home away from home. The only issue is with waiting time but that paratha n lassi is worth waiting for. Makhan is to die for."
1.0,We reached 45 minutes before closing time and were still refused service. And the manager was not even considerate enough to reply properly. We came all the way from 50km far away and the way they treated was disgusting...  DONT GO TO THIS PLACE. They dont respect people and are way in over their heads probably coz of the popularity gained over FB Terrible people terrible experience.
4.0,"So we reached this place at a very odd time, somewhere around 2:45 - 3PM. By the time we got there, they were sold out. We almost waited for about 35 minutes to get our paratha. We had ordered panner chicken paratha, the paratha was presented with a scoop of butter and tasted delicious."
5.0,"The menu says biggest Parantha in India, and they are possibly right. Completely loaded with butter and very cost effective(150 for smallest paranths which is more than good for 2 persons, and you have army personnel discount). Last evening I went to mooch marod for the famous paranthas. There was waiting of an hour, we placed our order of 2 queen size paranthas and sat outside on the charpai waiting for it. Finally when the paranthas came, they were scary big. 2 plates covering the full width of the charpai. Super tasty and safe aalu pyaaz parantha and a new taste of baby corn parantha was awsome. Lots of butter and 3 glasses of buttermilk. The seating was not very comfortable, but it was a different experience as not lot of places have night sky above, and a cot below and such tasty paranthas in front. I loved the paranthas, definitely a visit for all the hungry soles. But avoid going frequently, this can add a basketball in front of your tummy."
4.0,"I guess first of its kind of restaurant in Bengaluru city which provides jumbo size parathas tried non vegetarian parathas mutton keema onion,angara chicken onion paratha both were delicious  When I have seen the texture of chicken starters like afghani ,tangadi,tandoori kabab I felt that they would be tasty as I expected ,all chicken starters were succulent  and the staff are also so kind and tender"
4.0,"Great place to have parathaand lassi. I had queen size paratha and it served 3. Butter on it was typically home made and white so it will probably remind you the taste of Himachal and punjab if you have been there. Value for money, taste was very good. Forget about ambience as hardly there are places in Bangalore which serves good food which taste good as well. Otherwise I have seen people spending lots of money going to kormangla, indiranagar and pay for expensive dishes which are not worth. I would recommend to go with your family and enjoy the meal here."
5.0,The paarraaattaaaassss really tasty.. Little slow on weakeneds. But the wait is worth for those tasty parathas. Not too expensive very nominal charges. The size of parathas are too huge.  Mr.Anish the owner of this place is so down to earth I mean such a friendly nature the way he explained the menu and the size to be selected according to our appetite  too good.  Guys if you like parathas then you should visit this place atlest once.
5.0,"Amazing parathas. The size of the paratha is something which is unique to this place. Made in white butter (apparently, home made ), it really gives you a lip smacking experience. A must visit for every paratha lover. Hopefully, I will be among the first one to visit when they open a store in kormangala:P Overall a great place for paratha and lassi"
3.0,"Heard a lot about this place and finally been here. Over hyped place, Big size and putting so much butter doesn't make a paratha tasty.  Food and Price: Varieties of paratha each is in three sizes. Anyhow you couldn't taste variety coz small size partha can be feed to 2 people. Price is very reasonable. And hats off for there contribution to Indian Army.  Ambiance: Small outlet. Full dhaba style Char Pai sitting.  Service: Average but slow in weekends.  P.S. TRY ONCE"
4.0,"Good parathas, I tried chicken kheema paratha and lassi, mouth watering food. My colleagues ordered aloo paratha and paneer both where equally awesome. I would say a definite try for dhaba fans"
5.0,"I had a brunch with family here. It was fantastic experience. When we walked to the restaurant, owner welcomed us with warm smile. when we asked about spice level suitable for kid, he told us that he will ensure that. We had three different kind of veg parathas (aloo gobi onion, aloo methi and alu pyaz) and 5 different lassi. After having regular lassi glasses, we realized that bucket lassi isn't ment for mortals like us. It was very difficult to pick one over other since everything tasted fantastic. Paratha are really large in size, and they come with lot of butter and raita. My 5 years old daughter enjoyed the experience of seating outdoor on khaat and having meal, and was already asking about next visit, which says a lot about quality."
5.0,"Planned a Sunday around this place, and hands down, it was totally worth it. A little too far for South Bangaloreans(thank god they're opening soon in Kormangala!! )  The moment you enter the lane where Mooch Marod is, you're teleported into a typical highway foodcourt that is miles away from urban civilization. The ambience is absolutely nostalgic for those who've seen the Garden City version of Bangalore and those who are familiar with highways in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. For the ones who frequent restaurants with seating that's anything more than basic, this might be a cause for concern. My advice, don't let it keep you from the divine food that awaits.  A fairly simplistic approach to the Menu. Lots of varieties in Paranthas, Lassis, andStarters (only available in the evening ) with a few other rice-based dishes for those who don't want to indulge in their signature paranthas. Two separate kitchens and ordering points to keep the meat away from the veg food, so don't go around asking how long for your veg dish to the guy at the non-veg point.  If you're unsure of how much food you'll need, the staff will happily help you in making sure you get enough but not more than that (they prefer to avoid food wastage as much as possible ). Be prepared to wait a fair amount of time for the food, they're a popular place with many stomachs to fill at any given time of the day. That said, make sure you're here early for lunch, they were sold out of Paranthas within 3 hours of opening on a Sunday   Coming to the food itself, . We ordered 2 King-sizeParanthas and 2 Emperor (Bucket) Lassis to share amongst 6 of us. Suggestion, take 1 Lassi while you wait for the food and savour it, and the next one with the paranthas to complement their Buttery goodness.  The whole idea of having larger-than-life portions promotes the idea of sharing and truly enjoying a meal as a family so don't ask for extra plates, please. Use the waiting time to play some old-school games (never had so much fun with charades) that'll lighten up the mood, instead of gazing at phone screens like zombies.  The Aloo Gobi Onion (Potato-Cabbage-Onion) parantha was the first to land on our tables and it was a godsend  They have all-you-can-eat pudina chutney and mango pickle available on each table (ask them if you can't find it) to go with the generous amount of raita that comes with the rich Buttery Parantha topped with more butter  We ordered one which had a no-potato stuffing in Paneer Methi Onion (Cottage cheese-Fenugreek Leaves-Onion) and that arrived when we were three quarters done with the first parantha. Surprisingly we were happy enough to dig into that one with the same amount of excitement as before  This one was a little dry, although that's what you should expect from a parantha without potato. Taste-wise, both paranthas were near perfect and closest anyone has come to ""Maa kehaath keParanthe "" in my opinion   The Lassi. Oh my GOD, the LASSI  A bucket/Emperor Lassi is about a litre in portion. It's one bucket, so don't go asking for glasses. In all honesty, that's what made it more special. To have a bucket to pass around and fight for, was much more enjoyable than each one of us sipping away from our own glasses. We had Sweet Lassi, it was D.I.V.I.N.E. Just the right amount of sugar, thick, a layer of foam on top and clearly made with love. A signature Punjabi drink made just the way do in Punjab.   In all, this was a very different, much-needed reality check that reminded us of what get-togethers can be about. Experiences like these are what make this city diverse, not the insane number of clubs and pubs that promise you a unique experience. A Sunday lunch that is well and truly etched in my memory, one which will be remembered for years. Looking forward to the opening Kormangala and possibly one day taking up one of your challenges   Thank you, Mooch Marod.  A very happy customer."
5.0,"Really very delicious paranthas.. Just the way it should be. The white butter gives it a homely feel for the people of North. The taste again is very similar to what is served at home. Be careful with the quantity you have, don't get carried away by the taste and overeat ;)"
5.0,"Everything about this place was perfect. The khaat feeling, to white butter ,to perfectly stuffed paranthas made the Punjabi/Haryanvi style. Though the waiting was alot though the parantha and the lassi was worth the wait. The owner is also very jolly in nature. It gave a very personal and homely feeling. Make sure to carry Hajmola with you becoz you can't stop yourself overeating here. BEST Paranthas in Bangalore for sure"
4.0,"Well, if you are a foodie who loves Indian food, this is the place you should visit.. The paratha there.. oh my God ! Such huge paratha's with the homemade butter, just adds on to the taste ! It's worth the wait and yes, the overall experience is too good !"
5.0,"Very friendly atmosphere,paratha lovers must visit. We ordered queen size paratha and mooch marod special lassi,they have two shops...one for non veg and and one for veg"
4.0,"Will you accept the challenge? Paranthas come in 3 sizes: queen,king and emperor. The one you're looking in pictures is the smallest one: queen. Paranthas can be compared to ones you get in murthal except that they are not made in tandoor. They have a challenge: eat a emperor parantha and a lassi in 30 mins. They are still looking for their first winner to list it in the hall of fame. They have a very long waiting on weekends. So if you're coming be ready to wait for at least an hour."
4.0,If you want to enjoy real Punjabi parothas this is the place. They have huge sizes of parothas with loads of makkhan and chutneys. The place is just like dhaba. They have separate place for veg and non-veg.
4.0,"This one of a must try and amazing place in Bengaluru. You wont find a five star kinda ambience if you are looking for but ya if like dhaba or punjabi style paratha you will love it. They have khaat  old Indian style bed in which you will get served. Which is a nice feeling again depends on your comfort and expectation, but we liked it. You have to sit in open sky thats how its designed, please manage the expectations .  Food  I loved the way parathas were served, there are two joints 1. Non-veg parathas. 2. Veg paratha. Facing each other. We ordered one veg aloo pyaz emperor size paratha and 2 non veg keema paratha and this will take at least half an hour for preparation  so please hold your horses its a long wait . There are two ways the paratha are prepared oil based or butter based we choose butter base, for 3 paratha 1 kg approx butter was used  and its super heavy on your belly in caption please ensure what you order and how much we were 9 full grown adults and 3 parathas was tooooooo much for us along with lassi though. White butter is topped on paratha  this is part of the kg I mentioned above but it make parathas delicious . Non veg parathas are more yum .   Given a chance I will visit again, I would recommend this place to people who dont care about calories. Enjoy  guys. Adding some pictures of the day."
4.0,"Though their USP is their huge sized paratha, but the taste and stuffing of paratha is equally good. White butter on top of it, is cherry on the cake! They have huge variant of lassi, which is also a must try! Try to visit this place when you have sufficient time since it takes a bit after you place the order! Wait is worth it."
5.0,"Tasty food, Great ambience and Amazing hospitality. This place is class!!  The paneer Paratha was out of this world and Gud ka lassi was a perfect pallette cleanser!! Keep up the great food and love guys!!"
5.0,"A good dhaba like ambience, Although they should arrange some shade for the people who come to eat in afternoon! Amitians in this city may find this whole place like the copy of balli's. Awesome parantha with generous amount of home made butter! Yes ofcourse, eating here will mess up with your weight loss target. But a must try place and the guys who operate this place are very well behaved and freindly."
5.0,Nice dhaba style experience with awesome paratha with Makkhan on the top n which is a lot.. dont have much words to explain the taste n service. Owner is customer friendly. He attend every customer personally n suggest them how much food they should order n most of the time its totally correct. In my case also.   Note: make sure ur paratha cooked in butter which they use white for cooking n serving as well along with their special lassi..   Balle balle mooch marod.  P.s: they are coming to koramangala soon
4.0,"Heaven for paratha lovers. I have seen the same concept in Tapasya Paratha Junction, Rohtak, Haryana.(So Mooch marod is not the only place in india ,as they claim, where you get big parathas.) The setup is similar to the punjabi dhabas on highways. They have separate kitchen for veg and non-veg(Impressive). We ordered the Aalu ghobi king paratha and mango queen lassi. Loved it. The paratha was just perfect with the perfect amount of filling. I m not a fan of lassi but it was good. I had been there for brunch and after that dint had anything the whole day :D So for me its a pocket friendly place. :P Must try!! P.S. - They are opening outlet in Kormangla also."
4.0,"Yesterday, I visited this place with my friends. In the interior of Whitefield this is a small dhaba style restaurant serving Giant Authentic Punjabi Style Parantha's & Lassi. Dhaba style seating on Manja/Khat. They have separate kitchen & seating arrangement for Veg & Non veg so a big plus for strictly vegetarian folks.  We ordered three Paratha (Aloo Onion, Paneer Onion & Chicken Keema Angara) all queen Size, 3 queen size & one king size sweet Lassi. they served Paratha with White Butter, Raita, Pickle & Green Chutney. Taste was awesome, Angara is a good choice for people who love spicy.  At last I would say a must try restaurant & if you want to challenge your appetite go & take the challenge there!!"
5.0,"#paratha#massive#delicious great place to have mouth watering enormous sized paratha's. Loved the ambience, set just like a road size dhaba with cots. You can't eat one king paratha alone!! Lassi's are also great, emperor Lassi is served in a small bucket."
4.0,"Really good in taste and must try place with friends, families. its different from the nuances of Bangalore (pubs, cafes, breweries). If you are looking for punjabi cuisine, this place is on top of my list as it gives you the feeling of sitting relaxed on a cot - charpai and enjoying the giant Parathaas! Yes like others I found Lassi to be overpriced, But overall definitely a good place to enjoy the food, also the quality and service was good! They prepare limited stuff for lunch (till thier stuffing lasts, 4PM) and Dinner (starts at 7) to maintain the quality so be on time if you don't wanna lose the chance of tasting the Punjabi flavour in Bangalore."
5.0,If you love Paratha with maakan then this is the place for you. The taste was damn nice and the service was damn fast and good. Unlimited aachar & maakan is served with love.
1.0,I DON'T RECOMMEND this restaurant. There are two reason for that:  1) I found the food to be average and apart from the size nothing was exciting about it. I had Aloo Onion paratha and filling inside were not enough to get the taste of what I was eating.  2) The owner had 'mooch' but didn't know how to behave with a customer. When asked about the status of food ordered you might get scolding and insults in return from owner.  Stay away from this place.
2.0,"There is a golden rule which is follwed by every successful food joint and that is to treat every customer with respect and affection. Even if the food you serve is average, folks will visit you again just because of your behaviour and attitude towards them.  I don't know if the person who took our order was owner or not however, he gave us rave replies when we asked about our pending order! The place was not crowded as well. I wonder how they manage things when you have hungry mouths to feed on a Saturday evening!  You will gain nothing by replying ""ek ghanta bola toh ek ghante me hi aayega, ussey pehle nahi aayega""  There was a communication gap between vegetarian section and non vegetarian section. Which resulted in delay and confusion.  Coming to food, parathas were huge and tasted good. A dallop of white butter on hot parthas does the trick. Lassi was awesome.  I liked the food and would have visited again but after getting treated like this I will never recommend this place to anyone or go back there again."
1.0,The behaviour of the staffs was horrible. This was the first time we have experienced the staffs shouting on us since we have asked two times about our order. We asked in a friendly way but the way guy replied was totally unexpected. I would not recommend anyone for this place.
2.0,"The owner is confused as well as rude. He should have behaved properly. Overall the experience was okay, chicken keema paratha was good. Service was okay. Not recommended on a sunny day."
5.0,"I'm not eligible to review this place. Only one thing to say, GO AND HAVE THE FOOD THERE. If you are North Indian or parantha lover, you'll definitely like this place."
5.0,Couldn't ask for better than that...fabulous place especially if you are a parantha lover...you will not find awesome paranthas like this in bangalore...loved this place..
5.0,Tandoori chicken is a must try..A lot of options for yummy jumbo parathas in veg/non veg.. Requires multiple visit to try all the varieties due to the size of the parathas.The sitting arrangements gave a feel of dhaba .
3.0,"Gist: Do go here for the experience of the jumbo parathas, bucket lassi and eating while sitting on a khattia like in northern parts of India. However slightly overpriced, to be specific lassi felt more overpriced as compared to parathas.  Food: 4/5 Ambience: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Value for money: 3/5"
5.0,Great place and very good food.loved the concept of big paratha which make the entire family sit together and eat together.Good place for kids.
4.0,"Travelled 33kms to satiate the desire for a good paratha (apart from made at home). Got to know of this place and boy it was a great find for sure.  This place is out in the open, I mean just in the open, for many a strange experience. The star is the huge, I dare say HUGE perfectly roasted and drenched in butter, you cannot take your eyes off these Paranthas.  Settled on the char-pai and got to figuring the stuffing from the options.  OMG, the Aloo onion paratha with that dollop of butter melting on it, what a sight!  Fingers burning but could not resist tearing a piece and popping to calm the taste buds.. happy they were. In Bangalore, this to my knowledge has been the best paratha I have tasted.  We enjoyed 3 types parathas and each one held its place, but then the heart was on the aaloo one.   The lassis were another treat. Midly sweet and had the satisfying taste and flavour. No wonder that's the signature lassi.  About the owner, a delight to converse with so overall 4 star to the place and 5star for the food."
5.0,"It was our lunch date after a long time without the kiddos of course..got to know about this place from a family friend...being Punjabi fanatics we decided to give this place a try.. Google didi definitely helped us finding the place considering the fact that we were not that acquainted with the area.. The complex is like a mini food street..lots of food stalls indulging in different cuisines..concept is good..if you prefer class and comfort where you eat then this might be not the place for you Coming back to mooch marod,the place is small with the chauls spread out to accommodate people.one needs to sit cross legged on the cot..a plank of wood in the middle acts like the table in which your big plate of paratha is placed.we ordered paneer pyaaz methi paratha queen size.  The owner Anish was kind enough to ask about our eating abilities and then suggest accordingly..based in our feedback he suggested one queen paratha and two queen size Lassis Hubby ordered pudina lassi and I ordered masala lassi which was out of the world. We were asked specifically whether the paratha Shud be cooked in butter or refined oil..paratha and refined oil..no way..we told butter..thank god..parathas super hot super yummy with a generous filling and my god the size..queen is like a large pizza size ..lassi and paratha..stomach was full.  Would definitely come back for the hospitality and the food..thank you Anish for setting up such a place in Bangalore... On a parting note I asked him whether someone had won the challenge..he just smiled..as they say rest is history!!!"
5.0,"I have been to mooch marod sometimes back. The place gives a authentic view of dhaba with charpais and wooden plank which is so difficult to find in Bangalore set ups. I had aloo paratha, which made me remind my mother's parathas! The best part of parathas is they serve with home made butter which was too delicious! The thing to not miss and complements best is thier special Lassi, which nobody should miss. Overall best place to hangout and taste the authenticity of parathas..."
5.0,The paratha  Agar paratha ho to mooch marod jaisa warna na ho I have been coming here more often these days All kind of parathas and with unique taste  Loved it totally!!!!
5.0,Best place in bangalore to have paranthas.... Seriously it's Murthal in bangalore... Damn good variety and damn good quality...you get the paranthas in some instance without wait...
1.0,Food here is good but avoid going on weekends as the owner is not able to handle the rush. Seats are limited .  Food: Good Ambience: Bad Behaviour : Worst  Ask for receipt after payment and you would be surprised to see a hand written bill .
5.0,If you are truly Paratha lover along with lassi and juicy kebab.. it's must visit place... You will fall in love as I did. Most delicious Paratha and kebabs ever. Pure harayan wala taste
4.0,Fantastic experience. Tasty food. Very good ambience. The Gobi Panner paratha was very well made. Buttermilk was just exquisite. Warm gesture by the host. The fact that he requested some people not to waste food was really great. Has a different kitchen for veg and non veg. Like literally opposite buildings so a name you can trust. With this quality of food and reception you can actually try getting more space for accommodating people. A must eat place
4.0,"LAAAAARGE Parathas with A big dollop of makkhhan!! Tastes blissful!  The filling tastes like almost like home. Tried only ""two"" - Aloo Pyaaz and Gobhi pyaaz. Good amount of stuffing in the parathas.  The garlic in gobhi paratha felt bit odd however not bad.  Will return soon to try the non-veg parathas and the kebabs."
5.0,Outside the city but trust me one of the best Punjabi food outlet. I loved it !!!!! Even the owner is so polite and welcoming. Must try place for foodies
5.0,"Loved it! Paratha at it's best!! Really great Punjabi food and a fun place to hangout. Huge parathas, huge lassi...really had a ball. Not just size, this place offers great taste too. Must try!"

5.0,The best paratha's in town:) Bucket lassi is a must have here Nice service. Worth the  Hope to see many more branches in town. Classic Punjabi feel
5.0,"Went with a couple of friends to try out the famous Emperor Paratha. Missed out due to it being a weekend but had the king size paratha and lassi instead. Paratha tasted like heaven, stuffed to the brim with fillings and oozing with butter. A must visit place in the area. 10/10 would visit again. Cheers"
5.0,"true dhaba style. don't expect much about ambience n looks. buy when it comes to quality n taste, there's no match of this place. owners behaviour is very nice n he is very polite. helped us in everything like size of paratha n size of lassi as well. can't resist their home made butter which makes me feel like eating at home. service is very nice. need to wait for the food a little more buy it's worth waiting. you won't regret of waiting. every penny worth spending here."
2.0,Charging unnecessaraly.  Not  polite while recieving the order and while serving . No value of money. Order takes to much of time to get ready u have to wait for a long time
5.0,"Great food !!! , Awesome taste value for money ,, Desi punjabi style venue and serve the food with love and the quantity and the quality of food is awesome"
5.0,Nice concept of making parathas more great. Amazing taste and great seating plan. It gives good parathas with sweet and authentic mouth watering lassi.
4.0,"In order to experience it you need to visit it !!  Biggg size parathas with huge dollop of white butter...and the Lassi, oye hoye...just perfect.  Separate kitchens for veg and non-veg was something that is remarkable..good to see, in these times. Sitting arrangement give you pure Dhaba feel. The owner makes you feel comfortable and is a very cheerful person."
5.0,Mooch Marod gives you the typical dhaba style ambiance without having to leave the city and travel on highways to get this experience. Very friendly staff and makes sure you are comfortable and about the food its finger licking good. we had the Greenpeas Onion Paratha and I can tell that is the best Paratha I had so far in Bangalore. Missed to try the Non-Veg outlet and soon need to try the Thangdi Kebab and Mutton Seekh which are people's favorite craving at Mooch Marod. Waiting to Visit again for a delicious dinner with loved ones.
5.0,Well it is the best Parantha house in Bangalore. Very tasty and best part is it is clean and pure veg kitchen. Delicious Lassis with different flavours. It's just Super desi.
5.0,"Parathas are the main here, sweet lassi is the best with it, come with a proper appetite and be ready to feel Desi sitting on the khat under open sky, owner is warm hearted and welcoming, prove yourself by completing the challenge."
5.0,"Great place, worth it paratha, it's literally become my all time spot, owner too is a warm hearted person, don't forget to ask for the challenge, sit on khat and enjoy it all."
3.0,Over expensive but paratha taste is OK. Information not provided before for some extra charges.Lassi was not that delicious.Can improve more on the customer satisfaction part by providing the right information.
4.0,"Ha ...this one a love. A small place to have a desi home made like paratta, The have their cots and plank(tables) just like those typical dhabas. They specialise in parattas.Before placing ur orders make sure that u get the size of the parattas(servings) . Their lassi is"
3.0,"Been to this place more than twice and would love to go again. The place is great, you just need to hope it doesn't rain. The seating is fine but proving some cushions might actually help the seating.  I personally felt the Veg Parathas were way better than the Non-Veg. Well no one here can complain about the quantity for sure and quality is also pretty decent. The pickle and the sides they provide are also pretty good.  The Lassi is also good enough but felt a little on the pricier side. But it was really good.  One thing which I hate about this place is they don't give any water but give you a water bottle and charge you for that. I think any place should give water for free unless asked otherwise for bottled.  Sometimes the guy there can get a little cheesy, which is most of the times fun to watch.  Good place. Good food. Just go there with Good people."
5.0,"** Warm Hugs served on a plate ** Hidden gem in the heart of Whitefield. Being a Punjabi in Bangalore you definitely miss waking up to the whiff of piping hot Paranthas in the morning no?  Well then dont worry Mooch Marod got you covered.  With a wide range of paranthas to cater to your hunger pangs. Feast like a King with their Jumbo sized Paranthas which can make your loosely fitted clothes fit like a glove.   What I ordered:  > Paneer Aloo and Onion Parantha (Queen Sized) > Mooch Marod Special Lassi (Queen Sized)  What I got:  Maa ke haath ka swaad  with a hint of nostalgia. The parantha was freshly prepared and stuffed with a well seasoned and very flavourful filling, topped with a huge Dollop of their Homemade MAKHAN along with pickle, chutney and curd/raita.  The Lassi was the perfect accompaniment to the parantha with just the right amount of sweetness (which can be altered on request) and dry fruits to hit the right spot.   Ambience: The kitchen is small but functional. Complete with custom utensils and tableware for cooking food and serving it. They have open seating with Authentic Manjis/Chaarpais to elevate the food experience. Could be improved a little by increasing the seating spaces. You are served the food personally by the Owner/Supervisor who is sweeter than their Lassi and caters to all your needs with a smile as big as their paranthas.   Verdict: If you want a trip down the memory lane without burning a hole in your pocket then head to Mooch Marod to satisfy those parantha and lassi cravings which will fill your tummy to the seams yet leave you begging for more."
5.0,Paratha khaana h to mooch marod m khao vrna na khao. Go ask for paratha in asli (butter). They will serve you the best.  Lassi is the best part of the food here
3.0,Mooch Marod is typical paratha house.  They do not have typical sitting arrangement but like dhaba style in Punjab   They have huge size parathas   Quality of food - 3/5 Taste of food - 3/5 Value for money - 5/5  Overall rating - 3/5
5.0,"Nice place to have home like food, staffs are very courteous and humble..paratha are awesome and lassi is too good. thanks mooch marod for food like this."
5.0,Amazing place..!! Combination of desi swad with desi ambience ...!! Must have alloo parantha .. and do ask for extra butter...  On weekends their service is bit slow bcoz the place is fulled packed with parantha lovers... and these big paranthas take time to get cooked... its worth waiting for a yum big paratha.. king size parantha is good for 2 people... do try their king size sweet lassi..! Itssss yummmm ..! They don't add water like other restaurants do... its thick and delicious..! They have non-veg parathas too.. but i m veg .. so. no comments on non-veg part...!  Must visit place for parantha lovers in bengaluru
5.0,"The best parathas u will find in blore. Amazing Experience. Enjoyed every bit of it. The place and the friendly nature of the people makes the parathas more special . You will get a Desi experience here. Take it down in writing from me, u won't be disappointed."
4.0,"Maa k haath ka pyaar and punjab ka flavour. Zindagi mein aur kujhni chahiye. Pizza pasta focaccia sab farzi hai.  What to eat here :  Aloo pyaaz toh staple hai Ek paneer methi pyaaz wala was also very good Their lassi was LEGEN-waitforit-DARY! Na kam meetha na zyaada. Hit that sweet spot. *pun intended* all in all I loved it A LOT!  The paranthas are ginormous and yeh photos small waale ki hain unke King sized parantha can serve upto 4-5 people or maybe 2 people like me.  They have parantha eating challenge also   Veg and non-veg ka kitchen alag hai. Which is commendable!  Keema parantha mangwaya tha, wo boht masaledaar tha and maza aaya.  Jitna bada parantha dete hain Utna hi bada dollop of Makhan v dete hain Naal achaar te hari chutney. Mirchen thodi tone down krwani padti hain  Owner was a punjabi guy toh baat krke bhi boht maza aya. Very jolly person. Bas ek shortcoming thi dearth of seating arrangement and too many guest to attend to. The wait is a little long for the order but its justified given the quality and the taste. To tell frankly as we say in punjabi, Bande te banda chadheya hoya c thats the kind of rush they have and thats how jam packed this spot is. There was another time when we visited. 10:30 closing hoti hai and we reached at 9:10. EVERYTHING WAS SOLD OUT! Thats how great the food is. A nostalgia trip to punjab. OVER THE TOP, zyaada mehenga v ni hai."
5.0,"There is no other place like this in the nearby location, perfect combo of desi style with khaat and parantha lassi, situated in a place where u feel like being in a food street. Must go place, waiting to try out other paranthas and kababs. The manager and food both here is enough to make u feel like home."
5.0,Swaad-eh-Haryana. Amazing food. Never had a such tasty food in Bangalore. Much visit place. Ghar ka khana like taste. Makhan maar k. Lassi is awesome. Great varieties in lassi and all are amazing. Had great fun at the outlet. Specially sitting on kHAAT and having food. Ghar ki yaad gai.  love from ur bhai..(Rohtak wala).
5.0,A tiny little gem of a place hidden somewhere in Channasandra. They serve one of the best paranthas in Bangalore for sure.   BE CAREFUL OF THE QUANTITY THOUGH. One smallest parantha (Queen Size) they serve is sufficient for two average eaters. A must try!!!
5.0,A good place to have variety of parathas. Nicely served parathas. Food served in a style of place like Dhaba. Hygienic food in an open space. Good service while it was crowded.
5.0,I shifted to Chansandra only Yesterday and after a day long of shifting things to our new home made me and my wife really really hungry. Since we were new asked few pedestrians where to have our dinner and most pointed to this Eatery. Boy... for Paratha lovers this place is for them. The Owner of the Shop is really friendly and the Paratha served was the best we have eaten so far. Definitely a must try place who like to eat in Dhabba style atmosphere.
5.0,This place is heaven on earth . Amazing food quality and group can enjoy in very low budget lot of people can eat . Overall it's worth of spending money .
5.0,Best Paratha in bangalore so far. You can't resist yourself to eat more n more when it serve with white butter n a big glass of their special lassi. Owner is very friendly n guide us what n how much to order. For a moment I thought I'm in Punjab. Thanks for the yummy food n lovely memories.
4.0,"If you are looking for a genuine parantha place, you have it right here. The food is really good and with proper hygienic conditions. The staff is warm and welcoming.  Might have to wait on the weekends for a place but it's worth it.  Thumbs up."
5.0,"Visited this place just out of curiosity, after seeing the menu and review. Surely bang for your buck and awesome finger licking good and huge parathas served here. Tried their Alu-pyaaz and paneer-pyaaz paratha on the owners recommendation and both of those paratha were loaded with butter and super yum. The lassi served was also good but the consistency could have been a little thicker. Will surely visit again and will recommend to others"
5.0,Amazing place.  Owner of this restaurant is so well behaved.. Good service. Amazing food. A must try if you stay around Whitefield. Hope that quality is maintained forever..
5.0,"Mooch Marod serves the food your soul needs. Their range of Parathas and Lassis are delicious, taste direct from Punjab!!! Loved it now a regular here!! :)"
5.0,The go-to place for Punjabi style extravaganza. Mooch Marod = dil khush kar dene wala Paratha.  Recommendations : Aloo pyaz paratha with makkhan and Lassi
5.0,Amazing freaking food   Lassi just too damn good And paranthas ask the size before ordering because the King paranthas no one can eat one extremely cost effective
4.0,"If you are on for paratha, this is the place. If you are on for veg variety paratha, this is the place. If you are on for non veg variety paratha, this is the place. If you are on for veg/non veg variety paratha served on a big plate(as claimed by them the biggest paratha in india), this is the place. If you are on for veg/non veg variety paratha served on a bigger plate, this is the place. If you are on for veg/non veg variety paratha served on a bigger plate and want to have the feeling of the authentic dhaba style cots, then this is the place.  If you are on for that Punjabi styled lassi in different size of glasses or even mugs, then definitely this is the place."
4.0,I had a King size parantha which is served with lots of makkhan and chutneys enough to satisfy 3 people. It was a delicious and nutritional meal which one cannot forget. I also had most amazing Mooch Marod Signature Lassi. It's a must try delicacy!
5.0,"Its really nice. The food is nice coupled with the huge size of the parothas. Also, the ambience is nice. Food is tasty and then it is located at a nice place."
5.0,Great atmosphere and food.Value for money. Ambience is good. I would recommend a emporor thali if 4 people are going since that's the largest paratha they have and one is sufficient for 4 of them. Do try their bucket lassi and pan lassi.
5.0,"Food: Taste - 5 Quality - 5 Quantity - 5 Pricing - 3.5  Lassi - 4  Ambience: Seating - 3.5 (ekdum desi, might not be for everyone's liking but authenticity is what they play on) Entertainment - you're on your own here  Service - 5  VFM - 3.5  You want big? Mooch Marod's got you covered with huge Paranthas. Even the Queen size is good for 2 average people. Combine Paranthas with their Lassi and you're good to go for a good duration of the day."
5.0,Didn't know anything like this in Bangalore but thanks to that video on YouTube and Facebook through which I come go know about this place. I just love each n everything about this place. Great parathas with home made bitter and their signagure lassi. It's just awesome. Will be coming again n again and will recommend to others also. Value for money. It will satisfy your hunger n your soul.
5.0,"The parathas are amazing! So yummy and tasty The ambience is also very good. The wide variety of lassis is also amazing, would recommend a friend here for sure"
5.0,Amazing food at a great price and nice Punjabi ambience...everything they make is amazing and completely fulfilling...would definitely recommend people to come and eat here
3.5,OK...the size of king paratha is easily fulfilling for 2 or 3 people. The Street food like ambience makes it even better to spend some time. Friendly staff and food tastes really good. Lassi needs improvement. A must visit for paratha lovers.
5.0,Hospitality is way better than anywhere else. Parantha are tasty. King size is more or less sufficient for 2. We needed a parantha without Onion and Garlic. They prepared it nicely. Mooch marod special Lassi is good.
5.0,Really awesome pranthas ...remind us taste of Punjab .....ND butter chicken was really awesome ....nice ambians ...manji style .....reminding old Punjab days
5.0,"One of the best places to have food...totally desi punjabi food and the dishes are amazing. Good place to hangout, just like a outdoor dhaba. A lot of must try dishes when you go with your team."
4.5,I have been eating here for long time.but i was just waiting for right time to Review it and i think its perfect time. I was there on last Wednesday since i Normally go there to have paratha.but that day when i order mixveg panner paratha(the biggest paratha in town)  Anish (owner) told me there is suprice for you i was like wht.  When we got paratha served on charpie(manzaa)1st reaction was wow.. He served paratha with homemade butter (we marathi ppl call it loni) and it was perfect match to it..  Service 5/5 Food 5/5 Ambiance 4/5  They have there nonveg outlate next opposite to veg But nonveg Paratha has to improve test and service ill suggest anish (owner) to please try to improve that too we well like to have that also But w8 i was talking about paratha in nonveg outlate They serve butterchicken they best in town and some Grillchicken(mouth watering)  Njoy your paratha
3.0,"Food is good, but kitchen is very dirty I saw cook eating tabacoo before cooking and used same hands to make parathas and this happened on visit."
5.0,"Uniqueness in Paratha ... Quantity and quality both are good enough .  Service is also excellent , would love to come again . Apart from that it is hygienic"
5.0,one of the best places to have food. the paratha we had was epic (paneer onion mix paratha) . loved it.. the lassi as well is bomb . as must visit.
4.0,Had been here for lunch on weekday. They serve these huge parathas both veg and non veg. They have separate kitchens for both. The aloo parathas were topped with fresh white butter when we were there and it was good. The non veg parathas are heavy on the stomach. The best thing about this place is their special lassi. Don't miss this. It's thick rich and heavenly to drink especially in hot summer.
5.0,Awesomeplace!!!....awesome food!!!..... awesome ambience!!!!....awesome crowd....must try king jaggery lassi.... Love the place.... Staff are kind and polite... Must visit place
5.0,"Definitely a place to visit once and keep on visiting afterwards . I being from Haryana very fond and used to such kind of food , being in south India for last 6 Years was deprived of such kind of taste and quality of parathas and lassi . Especially the white butter was the unexpected thing that we can get at any outlets plus the parathas and lassi was no doubts the best you can get here in south .So definitely a place to visit."
5.0,It's an exellent food presently i am staying in bangalore but i missed north indian food As per mine view it's a correct place for north indians and very good taste I am fully enjoyed for this food
5.0,"Loved the food - the paranthas, the kababs and the lassi. HUGE portions to treat your eyes! So is the hospitality and Passion of the owner - Aneesh. He loves big groups to dine his place as he says it help build a positive environment with great bonding! Very authentic setting of charpai and a plank of wood to serve food. Its a must visit place for the experience and LOVELY food."
4.0,"I Dont know where to start from...The authentic punjabi parathas and lassi to die for.. With their queen, king and emperor size parathas and the taste is unbelievable...signature lassi lil heavy but loved it.. everything is great but sitting arrangement is where they are lacking!!"
5.0,The most amazing parathas I have ever had..a must go place with your friends..the most friendly place I have ever seen in terms of hospitality
5.0,We went there while roaming around and stumble upon charpai ... We immediately wanted to enjoy the desi ambiance :) ... One must have the tasty parathe with butter... Not to forget awesome jaggery lassi
4.0,"Ok, this review is pending for long time now as i was short of pics to mention variety they have. To start with- its a parantha shop that sells lassi along... any north indian would say... whats different... we get parantha in every corner or north india..... so here is a difference......PRESENTATION....... Yes presentation is different and the size of pranthas they offer are to die for.. then sitting is different.. they have laid down manjis to sit on( foldable cot in laymans term)... Difference lies in the mooch of the owner(Anish)... nice guy who supports heavy beard which is  akin to name of restaurant.....hospitality is good... Its in a small prashanti market but once u enter the market there is no way this joint will get unnoticed due to huge rush. Good part about parantha is that though they are huge in size but u break them from any side and u will see them stuffed.. so Anish ensures that quality is maintained... and icing on cake is white makkhan thats served on parantha. Guys i would advice if u want to visit this place then skip one meal before ur visit as u need to have that appetite to enjoy the sumptuous meal offered. Lassi is also good to have but after parantha u just need that manji and nothing else to retire"
5.0,Loved the taste of the babycorn paratha and kiwi lassi and felt it to be the best combination. And yeah the person there is the most friendliest amongst all restaurant owners i have met
5.0,I really love the kind of vegetarian food served at Mooch Marod. The kind of quality food they are serving is really great. I wish to visit here on every visit to the city. I strongly recommend you all to visit Mooch Marod
5.0,The best place to have parathas . The authentic taste of haryana . Palak paneer onion mix being the best when combined with lassi will fill you to the brim with amazing satisfaction.
5.0,"It goes by the saying zabardast desi.  Thats exactly how the food is also, the parathas are the best in town. People who want to know the desi people eat in their pind, should visit mooch marod.   The parathas are mouth watering and the amount of butter that is served with the parathas is heavenly.   Desi khaane ka mazza hi makkhan ke saath aata hain.   Best part its the only place where they serve you white butter also, try it you will fall in love with the food all over again.   Hum desi logon ki khaas baat hoti hain, garmi ho ya thaand ho humme lassi zaroor chahiye.   And you get the best lassi in town.   #bestplacetoeat"
5.0,"Found this place on lbb. Never realised such a place existed in Whitefield! Modestly located in a complex full of food joints, the first thing that struck me in this place was that the seating was not your regular tables and chairs, but charpoys with a wooden plank for placing your food. We ordered a slightly customised medium paratha (paneer, also and onion) and a small pudina lassi each. The paratha was huge - larger than a dominos large pizza, I'm sure! It was hot and tasty. The accompaniments (pickle, raita, chutney and butter) were also tasty. The lassi was really yummy and light. The owner of this place is a very kind and helpful person who really took care of everything we needed. Overall, a fantastic experience. Definitely coming back for more!"
5.0,Who said bangalore doesn't have   . And it's called Mooch marod . Parathas and Lassi are at its best. Awesome place to enjoy an evening with friends and get bowled over the Parathas.
4.0,"Food: Taste : This is the place for authentic punjabi pranthas. You can't ask for anything more in banglore . Quality - good quality food but you might feel very heavy after eating this since they make it in butter Quantity - don't get deceived. Size of prantha is really big. Two person can hardly finish a prantha Price - Around 200-250 per person *Must try - aloo onion pyaaz prantha , paneer palak prantha, aloo methi prantha and lassi  Ambiance: Outdoor seating on traditional indian charpai Service: Delivery time - they won't take much time. Wait time is around 15 20 minutes Staff - Owner is haryanvi guy. Very warm and polite. Overall experience was really good"
5.0,The best paratha place in Bangalore. I've visited so many paratha places in bangalore but none of them served parathas as big or as tastier as Mooch Marod's. The place is very much north indian. They have charpais to make you comfortable.  The food is very tasty and its so huge. We tried the aloo onion mix paratha.  Bring a friend there as they don't make regular sized parathas. Don't forget to try the mango lassi. The owner was very friendly. Might take 20 minutes to prepare your food. This place deserves applauds. a must visit place.
5.0,Can't find a better place for authentic punjabi paranthas in bangalore than this place. Visited it for first time this weekend and loved it. It was so satisfying with taste n feel. Would definitely visit this place again n again n would love to try the emperor parantha next time . Amazing food n Amazing hospitality. MOOCH MAROD Rocks!!!!
4.5,Amazing parathas and lassi. Main attraction is the size. Nice ambience and seating arrangements. Would like visit this place again and again.
5.0,Best place to have parathas of one with sweet tooth but the lassi here is just amazing. Good choice of place if one wants amazing parathas and lassi.
5.0,I visited this place on a Sunday night. I am a vegetarian so I ordered a paneer onion paratha king size and a special lassi king size. The food was extremely delicious. The scoop of fresh butter made the paratha even more delicious to eat. The charpoy which is placed instead of tables and chairs gives us a feeling of being on a road side dhaba. They have separate counters for veg and non veg which makes it a suitable eating place for orthodox vegetarian. The      guy at the counter was very friendly and tells us how much to order so that people do not order excess food and waste it. Overall a very enjoyable experience and first of its kind in Bangalore to serve big size paratha.
5.0,best paratha n biggest paratha in Bangalore. awesome lassi in bucket. highly recommended to everyone. waiting time is bit high but it's worth waiting. quality n hygiene is very nice
5.0,"had one of the best paratha in the town. they have paratha bigger than human face. you get chance to choose out of 3 varieties queen, king and emperor. go with family and order emperor. you are sorted for the day. don't forget to try lassi."
4.0,"Okay. So are you a north indian food fan?? Here it is... Mooch Marood.   What is so unique about it?? The SIZE.! And yeah.. the almost village type bed (char pai) on which you sit and eat.!  So the parathas come with queen, king and emperor size.. the king size can put the pizza to a shame.   Lots of variety for lassi as well. Again with prince, queen, king and emperor size. By the way the emperor is a full bucket sufficient for four!! I rather would suggest them to rename it to MAHESHMATI lassi..   Must visit once.  Taste wise also it will be a good experience."
3.0,"19 April 2018 Dinner Overall a decent place. Being a Paratha lover, and having tasted the finest parathas of the country in Murthal I always have high expectations whenever I go out for parathas. As of now, no restaurant in Bangalore has come close to that. Moving on with the review let me first start with the negatives : 1. The Parathas were not very soft. Specially the corners were pretty much a mess to chew on. 2. The filling was not up to the mark. Very thin layer of filling and too much spices. That was the primary reason of the parathas being hard. 3. The seating is in open. So be prepared for some mosquitos. This is not a big negative considering the fact that you don't get the North Indian dhaba ambience frequently in Bangalore. So while you get it enjoy it 4. No white butter! God, I'm dying for white butter here. The curd was more like Masala chaach. Too thin.  Now coming to the positives : 1. Humongous size! Ordered an emperor size Paratha and it was more than enough to fill 4. 2. Friendly manager. The manager was super friendly and he even got us made a Kadhai Paneer on demand even when it was not on their menu. 3. Coming to Kadhai Paneer. The taste was superb. 4. Lassi is pretty good too. 5. Serving style and ambience is pretty dhaba like. 6. Overwhelming quantity of butter when asked. 7. Value for money. 200Rs per person at the max and totally worth it  If you prefer quantity over quality this is your place to go. Few suggestions for the owner :  1. Get white butter along with parathas instead of Amul butter. 2. Focus more on fillings(potato, onion, etc) rather than spices 3. Arrange soap for handwash. 4. Introduce Tandoori parathe  If the above 4 points are taken care of, it'd undoubtedly be the best place for Parathas"
5.0,"Aloo onion paratha(medium size). Costly but every penby worth. Its huge, nicely stuffed, quality butter, pickle chutney raita..Havent been more satisfied with aloo paratha. Bet u wont miss punjab!!"
5.0,have been to this place twice ..both d time service n parathas were excellent... mango lassi is a must try ... in parathas palak panner paratha i liked most
4.0,"Got to know about the restaurant through FB and was really excited to be there. Last night, I visited the place n really loved the food & concept behind the restaurant which is unique in Bangalore. I went along with 3 of my friends n ordered a King Size Paratha(Paneer Methi Onion Mix paratha) & 2 Queen Size Lassi(Roafzaah Laasi & Special Lassi). Everything was really awesome that it would attract me again & again. Since We were little skeptical to finish Emperor Size paratha,So we ordered King Size this time. Next Time, I will surely try their other parathas & Emperor Size One. Ambience was really cool being the sitting space in open with their wooden bed ""khatiya"" ( as i say).  They have even a interesting dare to complete with a descent amount of money as a winning gift. Please find the dare in the image.  They have a separate kitchen for Veg & Non-vegeterians which is good for Vegetarians.  It's on the main road itself but the Google Map showed the wrong location.After reaching there, You can call the owner to be guided for the location."
5.0,We ordered 1 Queen size (Small) Aloo-Gobi-Onion Mix paratha. we were 2 people but we were some how manage to finish it off as it was too big in size and it was Yummy too.. We ordered regular sweet lassi as well and that was Delicious too.
5.0,Awesome paratha and huge one. 6 people were not able to finish one emperor paratha. Mast taste . Paratha and lassi combination liked it. Had to wait for 30 mins for Emperor paratha but worth it
5.0,"Must visit and must try Baalti Lassi. Owner is down to earth and can make the combinations as per your choice. Punjabis Vekh ke, ekko Jagah hai bangalore Vich."
5.0,"Quite a nice place for paratha lovers. Reasonable, clean and absolutely worth the money. The lassis were brilliant. Couldn't try their non-vegetarian parathas as they were closed for a week. But will definitely go back for them."
4.0,"Saw a video on this place yesterday on fb and crashed here tonight. I'm definitely visiting again with friends. Paratha's are pretty big is a common feedback but they are available in multiple size options according to your group size and hunger level. super spice component. sides are just wow  icing on the cake, host adds to the charm of this place. MUST VISIT!!"
5.0,"difficult to find place it's like hidden gem but amazing food , excellent paratha , superb lassi , different section for veg and non veg lovers"
4.0,"One word for this place.... i.e. ""Biggggggggg Parathaaaaaaaas"" and ""Bigggggggggg Lassi's"".  This place we found in chanasandra hidden within the streets but quite popular in whitefield due to its authentic tasty punjabi food.  A must visit place with your friends and family and enjoy the taste of Punjab."
1.0,"Had a bad experience here. Unluckily we were served with Aloo paratha filled only with chilly and lots of southern spices. Not sure whether it happened by mistake or just to give authentic touch. That authenticity fooled us. Be cautious while you order food. For sure, I an not going back there."
5.0,One needs heart of steel and stomach of titanium to eat it all.  Unleash your punjabi parathas desire here.  Rating : -  Ambience : 3.5/5  Service: 4/5  Food : 5/5
5.0,Food was good and tasty loved it!! Place and environment was pure Desi... Lassi fantastic Paratha was tasty and quantity was so huge that it was hard for us to complete
5.0,Wow..!! Amazing food. Humble hospitality. And the signature lassi which was heavenly delicious(BTW these guys serve lassi in a bucket). Parathas are so big I felt they were made for monsters. A must visit place. Could've rated 4.5 considering the ambience.. But I have fell in love with the parathas n lassi. P. S. :Take the challenge they offer of the emperor Parathas. It's a wonderful experience ;).
5.0,Amazing quality of home delivery food... Packaging is awesome. Lots of extra butter and servings. The Parantha is delivered when hot. Also if you visit this place. It has amazing ambience. They keep non veg and vegetables kitchen separate so it's good for mixed groups. Definitely recommend visiting this place once and trying the Amazing food
4.0,"the stuffing was less ,taste wise good"
2.0,"it's a huge one, need to have company at least 4 members to complete one stuffed one... the delivery food got dry, need a better packing."
5.0,"Amazing place for parathas... If you have ever tried paratha in North India on Highway and you liked it... This is the place in bengaluru to refresh it. Nice khatiya setup, polite and friendly staff.. Do try lassi bucket and don't try to it food in paper plate or drink lassi in plastic glass, be desi eat desi...."
4.0,Afghani tagdi kabab is a must try. Parathas are huge n delicious. Eating on khatiya is different yet amazing experience. A must try place
5.0,it was good visiting hear.Food taste is excellent and loved it completely ...the sitting place is also very unique nd cool... good place for students... i completely liked it.
5.0,It's a nice and good place for a family to have a ultimate dinner #BIGGERTHEFAMILY  #BIGGERTHEPARATHA  Note : Indian army get some good discount
4.5,Awesome lipsmacking paranthas. Was recommended this place by a friend. Great place to hangout with friends. Paratnhas are tasty and true to their names. I had the special emperor size lassi and it was just great.
4.0,"Awesome food. And great portion. Had a decent paratha after a long time in Bangalore. They have a large variety too so to cater to the tastes of different likes. But there is a downside to having a large sized paratha that it cools down pretty fast while you are still eating. The Lassi menu too boasts of variety but it was at best OK. Authentic Lassi is on the thicker side, however this one was of pretty thin consistency. Overall a decent and value for money place to hang out casually with friends/family and savor a good meal. Also request the owner to provide valid bills going forward."
4.5,"We wanted to visit this place after seeing the reviews on zomato. Finally we could make it today.  The place is a little difficult to find, but once you get there, it is worth the trouble. The paratha as excellent and the lassi is also very nice. But you should have a great appetite to finish a paratha. We were two of us and still we had to parcel almost half the small paratha.  A must visit place for those who crave Punjabi paratha.  We tried the aloo, gobi, onion paratha. Really tasty. Value for money place."
5.0,"Amazing paratha size and taste..  Love to visit you again and again.. Totally recomend friends to visit this place..  Worth the money spent and if any one loves challanges, you get one right here .. Have the stomach for a challange do visit."
5.0,Exotic parathas with superb lassis... get challenged and get feed... as if king size is not big enough they have it emperor size to challenge your appetite... Only paratha and lassi in menu... but still you wont feel anything missing as the stuffing will be enough to fill you up!
4.5,"Sandipan Mondal  Word of mouth publicity is all that this 10-month old joint relies on. We ended up here, based on multiple recommendations. Now we shall pass on the recommendation and hope network effect kicks in.  The experience: A wooden plank is placed across a wood and nylon 'khatiya'. That, is your table. Loved the feel of it. We gave our own paratha mix to which the owner simply remarked, 'Bana denge' (we'll make it). Had aloo, methi, onion and peas paratha. And a jaggery lassi. Both were queen sized and two of us were left very very satisfied, both with the size and the taste of them. The owner was friendly and good with words. The last word we had with the owner was that we will be returning with a larger group to try the emperor sized paratha!"
5.0,"If you are in love with parantha's this place is a must visit. The parantha's come in very interesting sizes starting with Prince>Queen>King>Emperor... so are the Lassi glasses. The chicken is so soft and savory. The food is so awesome that you will regret not being able to have it all...The serve you on so called charpai.. full desi style. The stuffing on parantha is awesome, had it with chicken masala ...Tandoori chicken as starter too good... and to end it with lassi... you will definitely need sometime to stand back on your feet after having a full course meal. A must visit for food (especially parantha) lovers."
5.0,"One of the best places in channasandra. Great quantity as well as quality. It's dhaba like seating arrangement is one of the best features of the place. 100% vegetarian place. Non-vagitarians, don't feel bad you have an amazing place to go to which is located right in front of this one, named Tau Ji. Similar ambiance and great taste.  Lassi is their specialty. You would get a number of sizes in both your parathas as well as Lassi.  Pro tip: go with empty stomach and enjoy as many items on the list as you can."
5.0,"Amazing paratha and lassi. Price is reasonable and seatings are good. It's in a food court near bus station. A must visit place if you are near Channsandra, Whitefield."
4.5,"Awesome food, amazing lassi, If u are around and foody don't miss it and the amazing part is sitting over there it will take you to village zone..... #feeldesi"
4.5,"Situated in Prashanti Complex ,Channasandra Main Road, Near Bus stop. This place is a must visit. The seating arrangement is very good, it will give u a feel of north Indian pind (village).  The lassi , paratha everything is good. One must try their parathas which comes in different sizes. They provide quality food at very pocket friendly rate. U will get addicted to this place.  We ordered Queen Size Aloo Paratha and Queen Size Gobi Aloo Paratha, Medium Sweet Lassi and Prince Size Jaggeri Lassi. They have 3 sizes in Paratha, Queen being the smallest, King and Emperor. Queen size paratha is more than enough for 2 people. And in lassi they also have different size glasses.  Rating : Ambience : 3.5/5 Service: 4/5 Food : 5/5 Overall Rating : 4.5/5 Keep up the good work Happy Eating Mooch Marod"
4.5,"Very nice place for a Good set of Parathas. Oh sorry not set of Parathas, a Single Queen size paratha can do for 2-3 people. That big it is.  Must visit. 3 people go for Queen. 4-5 for King. 6-7 for Emperor size. Lassi was also up to the price mark. Well worth for Money u pay. They have nice Charpoys where u can relax and eat. Nice person with good suggestive service."
3.5,"Food and service are Good But is not in sync with prices....,.....,...................................,..........................................."
5.0,My first experience eating Aloo Parata and it was the best!!!  The humangus Lassiwas something out of this world.. And a total value for money!!  It's something great for all you foodies out there...
5.0,"The Paratha in this place are awesome and the Lassi compliments it very well. If you are an Paratha lover you should definitely try this place. The Paratha's are huge, we tried a queen Panner Gobi with butter one which itself was filling and a glass of their special Lassi just completed our meal.  The ambience is all set like a Dabba itself, Coir cot with wooden plank to keep your plate. The owner is very friendly. If you are near Whitefield do visit this place."
5.0,Best paratha in town I had aloo Partha it was so delicious  it's huge in size even stuffing was also too much if u want have authentic Punjabi Partha so visit here and who was handling this restaurant his behavior was nice... @@@
4.5,"Nice place to hang out, great hospitality, great taste and everyone has to taste their signature lassi, shop owner friendly.You will get paratha as Emperor size, king size, queen size, if your gang has 6 people you can go for emperor, for 4 people king size is enough"
4.5,Best paratha and lassi in town. Very friendly host and nice ambience. Must try queen size lassi. Methi panneer paratha is to die for..delicious
5.0,I never get bored visiting this place. They have the best parathas. They upgraded their menu with even more bigger size parathas. The price is very reasonable and the taste is so good. P.S: Not a big restaurant. One queen size paratha can be shared by two.
5.0,Authentic Punjabi food. Authentic Punjabi feel. What more can a food lover ask for?  Value for money it is . Everything about this place is simply amazing.
5.0,We ordered King size aaloo paratha and lassi. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. We visited at very late hours 11pm which is closing time but still they served and their behaviour was nice.
5.0,"Awesome paratha & lassi, I just love this place & the taste these guys are serving. Couldn't find this much tasty paratha & lassi in entire banaglore & size of paratha & lassi is too big. Never seen such big paratha & lassi before.  Keep it up guys"
5.0,"Hands down the best paratha in bangalore. They have queen size and king size parathas available. When they say queen size and king size, visualize the bed sizes. Parathas are simply ginormous. One queen size paratha can easily serve 3 people. Still me and my wife managed to finish it off, as it was so tasty. And if you are too health conscious then beware they put a ton of butter on the paratha, but who cares they are so yummy. The Lassi was average.. Especially the mango one.    Talking about ambience they are a typical road side dhaba kind of a restaurant. They don't have tables instead they have charpoys for seating and a wooden plank placed on top servers as the table. So be ready to remove your shoes and eat indian style. This  is located in a food street kind of a setup opposite Mayura bakery and behind just bake in channasandra, and because there are so many eateries around you should expect some flies to be around.  They are very affordable.. Lunch for two cost us just 220Rs. There is ample parking available at the entrance of the Prashanti shopping complex.   Taste 5  Value for money 5 Cleanliness 3.5."

4.0,"A place with some great Punjabi food. Staff is friendly and is popular with the college crowd and probably the only place in Bangalore to serve such big parathas. If you love paratha then this is the place to go. Queen is enough for 2 average people, but king size is the real deal! Even lassi was really good here!"
