1.0,"Not at all value for money, we ordered starters they were barely 4-5 pieces for which they charge around 350, taste was average. name is just dhabha prices are rocket high"
4.0,I went for lunch here.There was a puppet show going on.Ambience was nice and decent.We ordered dhaba style paneer tikka.It was ok.Then we ordered butter garlic naan and mushroom.For serving the main course they took almost half n hour.But to apologise for inconvenience caused to us they gave sweet dish as a complimentary item..Overall it was Average in terms of food but the staff was polite so thats y i am giving 4.
3.0,I love there ghost and lassi ... we once took a tiffin box meal. It was amazing and felt nice with there different serving style ..   And place is also extremely cool...Perfect gateway with friends
4.0,Lovely ambience lovely love lovely service! Dhaba ho dhaba ! Come alone and enjoy ur time! Must try is Mava de lassi and the rabdi... Served by Vijoy !
1.0,"Went for Buffet, I'm vegetarian. Starters and chaats were really bad. Worst panipuri and kachori I ever had. Gravies were bit uncooked, I could taste raw masalas. Desserts were okay, not too sweet. They should definitely improve on service. One of my colleagues went on call, when he came back his plate was taken away by waiter. Starters were not served as quickly. Complimentary drinks were not good at all. Don't recommend Buffet here."
4.0,For starters we had ordered Murg Chaapein which was from their summer special menu. The chicken was cooked to perfect and soft and tender. For mains we had ordered their Dhabe di roti which was very very soft  accompanied with Bhatinda chicken curry. Curry was ok nothing wow to my taste. Deserts we order Mawe di lassi which was very filling and loaded with Mawa and nuts. must try
4.0,"We went to this place just because we were way hungry. The ambience is really amazing. The staff is quick and responsive and very courteous. The food came. If Punjabi food is considered, taste wise it was just satisfactory, nothing amazing, taking into account we had better tasting food elsewhere. The Chicken Tangdi Kabab was nice. The cheese garlic naan was pretty awesome too."

5.0,Went here for Dinner.Vijay served us well there.Food was good.One of dish ordered Rara Mutton.Was Really Good.But I wish the pieces was little better.Over all Good place to go.
5.0,"Ambience is seriously good. Staffs are really polite and helpful. Food is really tasty and good. Also, got a surprise here is the form of free dessert. Would like to visit this place again."
1.0,Went for a la carte .. not a good choice and bad experience.. starters and main course not healthy at all.. while family suffered severe constipation later in the evening. Too many waiters will be around you but still getting someone to take order will be time consuming.
5.0,"This is one of the finest place I have visited. The food was really delectable and palatable. You can really feel the North Indian flavours. The staffwere very corteous and friendly. We had Bhatti Di Tangdi, Bhatinda Chicken Curry, Amritsari Kulcha, and each and every dish was a melony of flavors and then came the show stopper the dessert Dhabe Di Mittha. It was Bomb. Layers of happiness unfolded. A must try place. And most recommend"
5.0,Loved this place and it's ambience .... Really enjoyed with my friends and family ..... Must try murgh seekh tawa masala .... Very friendly and lively management :-)
5.0,Awesome food. Authentic taste of North Indian food. Just loved it. Price is a bit on the higher side as compared to the quantity. Staff were a bit slow.. May be due to full house place... But courteous
2.0,"Food be it vegetarian or Non vegetarian is decent, one you can get at any other good restaurant. I have given it 2 star because of ambience, rest deducting 3 stars is all because if price. Cost is so high that it beats any other eatery around, for ex..drink like Jaljeera or Aam Panna ,Lassi is around 200-250bucks. Your biggest disappointment would be ordering at home because the portion size further reduce down. Small Qty of Mutton curry and rice would cost you 329. Overall they really need to work on the prices of all dishes esp. when there isn't any Oomph factor in the food."
5.0,"Nice ambience, Great staff and yummy food. What else you want? Decent place to hangout. Tried murgh Sikh tawa masala,paneer Tikka, dal makhani, gulab jamoon."
5.0,Fabulous Hotel which is very very service oriented and maintains the authentic flavours of food. Love their Baigan Bhartha...Lip Smacking. Heard Chicken Biryani is awesome from my friends who relished it till last piece.
5.0,"One of the best restaurant in Bangalore.The food,service and the ambiance was very nice.Had a great evening.Good place for celebration a special occasion for group and couple also.The service staff was very friendly.Thanks to every one."
5.0,"Excellent!! This place serves one of the most authentic Punjabi food in Bangalore. The ambience is great... !! The service is great !! Food is awesome !! Perfect place for team outings, family outings or even if you are dating a foodie !! The quantity of the food served for the price taken is justified !! Don't miss the butter chicken or the lassi if you visit place !!"
5.0,"The Daal Makhni was to die for and while the other dishes were good too, the daal was a clear stand out. The interiors were designed nicely and in theme with the name, ""Dhaba""."
4.0,This place is colourful as expected. Food is delicious and have kathputhli performances too. But the service is slow and it's bit expensive. Ideal place for team outing or family lunch/dinner. And they service delicious lassi.
1.0,"Over priced food, not worth a visit without zomato gold, too expensive for middle class family to dine in, did not allow us to use two zomato gold ids as well, this is the first time we faced this issue. The butter nuns were overpriced and two small & thin compared to the price. Got almost zero service but charged almost 100 as service charge, which i feel is totally unjustified. Not a good experience. Will definetly not visit again."
5.0,"Great Ambience, Great Service, Great Food. Had a great evening here. We visited on a weekday and still the place was almost full Would recommend the place to anyone."
3.0,"Decided to have a dhaba style food and this outlet caught my eye, read few reviews and decided to give it a shot. First impression is good, the ambiance and decorum is more or less Like a dhaba. Checked with service staff and got to know we had both buffet and a la carte menu...me being a foodies decided to go for the buffet. Food : Non veg starters were good but not great, veg starter were disappointing. Main course was better than the starters, tough all the gravy tasted the same. Was expecting more variety hence a bit disappointed. Deserts were a complete let down, the gulab jamun to mal pua were disappointing, trust me you can do much better. I believe one should try a la carte rather than buffet. Staff & Service: Staff was polite and generous. Service was slow and had to repeatedly call the staff to repeat the starters as they were served on the table, I believe both buffet and a la carte being served together makes this chaos. Overall 3/5 for me...can to alot better."
4.0,"Very very good ambience... the theme of dhaba is very nice, the cutlery, tables, setup, typical Punjabi. Great punjabi food... tastes real good. Good place to celebrate a special occasion for couple as well as for a group.. servers are friendly, but you need to be patient till you receive the order... Cheers for the foodies....."
5.0,"Visited here today loved ambiance,food and extraordinary service great hospitality by Mr. Sarvesh. Surely we will visit again. Thanks to team Dhaba"
5.0,One of the best places for punjabi food in Bangalore. The amritsari chole are to die for. The staff is very friendly and always smiling. The songs they place here are good punjabi music. It gives you an authentic punjabi experience.
4.0,"Great food. The dal makhni was amazing. The Garlic naan was good. Apart from that we ordered, chicken haandi which was good, tiffin mutton which was very good and afhgani chicken which was decent."
5.0,Good ambience and presentation was good. Would have been even more great if u had some egg appetizers. Master who assisted us Bijoy was calm and good.
5.0,Amazing service and delhi cuisine food. Must go place for north india food. Prices are also reasonable. Valet parking is also available. Kudos
5.0,"The place where one can enjoy and have one of the best north indian food , the service is lightning quick , the staff is very courteous and friendly , the place is highly recommended for north indian food"
4.0,"Good place for hang out. The food is great - vegetarian as well as non vegetarian. Drinks are good too. Come here to enjoy the taste of North India in South India. A little slow in service, but overall a great place to visit. Will visit again soon."
5.0,Amazing restaurant. One of favourites in Bangalore. The food is really well prepared and it's really yummy as well. The way the dishes are served are also very innovative. I love the effort put in this place from decorating the place to the names of the dishes on the menu to the presentation of the dishes and to the taste. Everything was perfect. Can't wait to visit again. I'm coming very soon :)
5.0,"Dhaba is the best place for food lovers. Both veg and non- veg food is so good. the ambience is cherishing. We had Bijoy at our sight who was helping us throughout. He had a calm and friendly nature. Except the money, everything is same as Dhaba[local]. Overall experience was good and music is enjoyable."
5.0,"Great place if you're a foodie. The food is really good, especially the Highway Chicken Tikka and the do try the Bhatinda Chicken Curry with Butter Naan in the main course. Ambience is also nice and so is the music. Bijoy :) and the other staff are really good !!!! The desserts are Amazzzinggg :) #foodie #chicken #fun #desserts."
5.0,Food is amazing. We had chilli chicken and balti meat...must try!!! The staff are very generous and friendly... You should definitely visit
5.0,"The food is great here. Ordered murg malai tikka, galauti kabab, mixed masala kulcha, kadai paneer, lassi, gulab jamun with ice cream. Starters to dessert everything was delicious. Staffs are really courteous and helpful. The fever was high as it was the IPL finale Sunday, and we could relish it while having dinner, thanks to the large screen at the restaurant."
5.0,Good - Pure Punjabi type with lots of cream and butter. Bad- Overpriced. 1 mineral water is almost 105 bucks. Steamed rice = matka khulfi -200 bucks. I am completely satisfied with the food
5.0,"Great food, had vegetarian food here Dal makhni was amazing laccha paratha was also good. Beverages was nice and the dessert was also good, staff was very courteous."
4.0,Its a Dhaba like setup inside and for that same reason I didnt feel like drinking from there.  Food was good but most of them had similar taste/type. Service was okay and so was the ambience.
2.0,"I have not been to the restaurant and have been ordering food via Zomato from this place so sharing my experience for home delivery. I ordered food from them on 24, 25, 26, 29th April and 5th may.  Taste - when it comes to food, this is one of the most important thing. Food tasted great despite having it at home delivered via Zomato on all the week days. Read it again on all the week days. However it was worse then horrible yesterday. Stale smelly onions, Tasteless oily fish (ordered fish fry), undercooked koftas and rubbery kulcha. A roadside eatery can give better food than what we got yesterday. Decided not to order ever again on Weekend. I understand there is rush over weekend specially on Sunday when many people order food online but no point of serving bad food. One bad experience kills all good times. If you can't handle rush maintaining quality, don't serve the food at all rather than sending pathetic food.  Portions - Quantity is ok for 2 people. Had starters as well as main course and it was sufficient. Biriyani quantity is definitely less if you compare it with other joints who serve only biriyani. quantity is good for 2 people with good appetite when it comes to main course or starters.  Packing - They use plastic container with hard cling film (hot press). No cutlery provided which is good for us. There delivery bags are made of paper in which these containers are kept. They are bright, reusable which is very good thing.  Service - I called them many time when i used to order via zomato to know more about the dishes. So that experience was good. Not sure about in restaurant.  To conclude, I could recommend this place to order food online only on weekdays basis my experience with them so far. However after yesterday's experience, it is strict no no.  Managers / Proprietors of this place, ensure your food quality is great even when you send it for delivery. I couldn't take pictures else could have posted them here."
4.0,"I had dinner with my family this weekend...though have been to foxtrot couple of times. Each time, I go I find it to be an awesome place with yummy food options....great ambience .... Would love to visit again and again...."
5.0,The food is truly authentic and utterly delicious. Devendra has been a great host and his service was amazing. One of the best places to dine in Bangalore. Must visit.
4.0,"Food is great,proper Punjabi style and authentic taste.staff is very friendly and nice. We had chicken Punjabi and kulcha which is amazing here."
4.0,Ambience-4/5 Food-4/5 Service-4/5 VFM-4/5  I love the simplicity of this place and the politeness of the staff. Almost everything on the menu is awesome and won't burn a hole in your pocket.
5.0,If you need a proper authentic delhi styledhaba wala feeling here at bangalore then surely do visit this place with your family or friends.Though it has less starter menu options but whatever they have is damn too tasty.A must try dish from veg starter is VEG GALAUTI KABAB and from main course in dal menu is Dhaba special Dal(Dal Makhani).Every food has its authentic North Indian dhaba flavours in it.Ambience will make u feel like you are away from bangalore and now at Delhi..They welcome every gues with their authentic Dhol ..
1.0,"Went for lunch with my friends. The place is overpriced compared to the dishes. Biriyani which is not sufficient for one person is 600. And one coke which you get for 40 rupees is 150 rupees. And moreover we ordered 3 cokes but they put price for 4 in the bill. When asked why its 150 the reply was immediately "" buying, cooling and service charges""."
5.0,Food is so tasty. If you are in mood to have some good tasty Punjabi food you can visit this place. Servicing is also good. Good staff. Love the food.
4.0,"A truly great place to have North Indian food in Bangalore. There are many outlets in Bangalore but Dhaba is probably the best when it comes to authentic North Indian taste. Having eaten in Chandni Chowk, Daryaganj and numerous places in Delhi, I can definitely vouch for this restaurant. The one thing you must try here is their Malai Tikka (Chicken). We were lucky enough to be served our food by Mr. Devendra who graciously suggested us the best items. The service was impeccable. I can read some reviews where they say that service is slow but North Indian Food, especially Tandoor cooked food takes time. The Malai Kofta was also great. The Butter Chicken was decent but I have had better. Definitely recommended!"
3.0,On Zomato gold. Right below foxtrot. Ambience is nice. All around painted like a dhaba. Reminds you of Chandni Chowk. Food is average and expensive! We tried the starter platters. Average. Dal was amazing! Rotis is we're great. Mawa lassi was quite good. The rabdi was really good. Seriously overpriced.
5.0,Great place to enjoy North Indian delicacies... Bhattinda chicken must try with dhabe Di daal makhani. Dinner is incomplete with dhaba special mithayi.
4.0,"Had a buffet lunch today..service was bit slow..every time we need to remind the starters..coming to the food..served sweet corn soup, which was hot and tasty..now the starters both the chicken items were marinated perfectly,fish finger was cooked well ,paneer tikka I liked the most,main course was average just 6 items..which is less when compared to other buffet restaurants..dal makhani stood out .desert part was few but still it tasted  great..weekend buffet Rs.750 per head is pricey for the food n ambience but still can try once for their different varieties in starters..paid thru dine out n got some discounts!!"
2.0,Prices were on the expensive side ... Taste was ok ok ... For that price range I expected awesome taste which was missing .... Ambience was decent ... Service was decent but service charge of 10% wasn't justified for the level of service I recieved .. going by this service charge rate bbq needs to charge 50%
5.0,Food and ambiance was good.The waiters performed a dance which was entertaining.Pritam served us very well.Overall experience was awesome would recommend to others
4.0,Overall a good place with good food! Found the waiters there are not enough maybe when we went at a crowded time but the food is great Loved the mutton gravy
4.0,"One of the best places for North Indian food in Bangalore. you have to visit this place or the outlet in Indiranagar if you like butter chicken, chicken Tikka, lassi, and other North Indian delicacies.   I loved the butter chicken, lachha paratha, chicken tikka and the kala khatta in a banta bottle. The mawa lassi wasn't great though. It could have been colder and thicker with a lot more Malai. So the -1 for that and the slow service.   Loved the quirky ambience and the decor."
4.0,"I came to this place for team lunch. We liked the environment. The place is nicely decorated in dhaba style. I liked the butter chicken, chicken Tikka, fish Tikka and fish malabari. My teammates also liked the papri chat. They have variety in dessert, most of them are our Indian dessert. There are varieties of achar unlike many other places. This place good for team lunch and get together."
3.0,"Good service by devendra., Good ambiance , music can be better , quantity of starters can be more . Taste of food was good . Good choice of spices. Not very gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood Soooooooooooooopoooer"
4.0,We came for a corporate lunch .we choose ala carte.Good service by Devendra. Good ambience. Starters were very tasty.Briyani could have been better.
5.0,We visited this place for our team lunch. Ambience was desi style with loads of bollywood influence. Mutton dishes are must try. Even roti and gravy items were good. Although din like the biryani. Special thanks to Devendra for the hospitality. Will visit again.
5.0,We visited this place for a team lunch and had a good experience. Staff is friendly and place is good... We all had a good time with a dhaba atmosphere..
5.0,We visited this place for a team lunch from office and Food was good and best part was they prepared Dal Khichdi on demand . ....... ... Lassi was yum and delicious.........
4.0,Ambiance is good.food is awesome specially non veg.service from ppl Devendra is great.great hospitality n ppl should experience it.love the places.
5.0,Awesome ambience and awesome food. Was out here with my girlfriends and enjoyed every minute of it. Ordered veg food and to my surprise...paneer was awesome and trust me I am not even a fan of paneer. Staff very attentive and friendly. And gor those cricket lovers...they also stream IPL...in case you wanna visit and fun with your boys/girls.
3.0,"Polite staff, food is a bit pricey. Interiors of a modern dhaba. Live IPL screening with a wide range of lassi. Gulkand lassi was really nice. Tried Achaari soya Chaap, not upto the mark. However Rice and Aloo Gobi Tamatar masala was good."
2.0,Not Happy with the staff Full of attitude Specially the staff services that was very rude and unethical. Not satisfactory. Food is okay And location is good.
5.0,"Best place I have been to in a while. Most courteous staff. Dishes we tried based on suggestion of our server are Paneer makkhan masala, Bhuna aaloo, Maava Lassi, all of these dishes were awesome. Thanks to our server Devendra for giving us such a nice experience."
5.0,Awesome food. Awesome service. Thanks to @gaurav. Will surely visit again. Dal makhani was expecially very good. Overall a good place. Ttttttt
5.0,Had an amazing lunch at this place.. delectable dal makhni and sinful thandaai..Devendra was very helpful and polite..this was a delightful experience...
3.0,"Place is okay-ish. They have done a lot of theming and made a perfect dhaba vibe. The worst point is the food charges and slow waiters. We had to call for water after every glass we finished, keeping a jug of cold water on the customers table is a common sense which they failed to achieve."
5.0,Thanks for a well organised dinner for My mothers birthday. It was a pleasure hosting our dinner at Dhaba. Specially the all food you served was delicious and service is prompt and efficient Everyone loved the food and the service. Thanking the whole team of Dhaba for making the evening a memorable one.
5.0,One of the best Dal makhanis I have ever had!  Mr Devendras hospitality is spot on! He served me and my friend really well! Had an awesome weekend!!  Must visit!
4.0,"Beautiful ambience,tasty food , tasty rabri, well served by devendra, like the music as well as members. Tried kofta and likes a lot. Little bit expensive but tasty food."
5.0,"Awesome authentic Punjabi delicacy, unexpected taste, highly recommend place to visit who loves typically north Indian food.. as you can see pictures say a lot."
5.0,"Sumptuous Food, Awesome Ambience And lastly the gesture shown by management Specially Devendra is so heart warming.  Loved it.Guys please try it once Desi food with great taste......"
4.0,Ambience 3.5/5 Service 4/5 Food 4/5  This restaurant is decked up like a dhaba. It has rajasthani look and surprisingly they screen ipl matches.  Service was good and the waiters did their best.  Food was okay. Not too fancy but just about right. Didn't delight me and could have been better.
5.0,Great place! Had my team lunch over here and we had an amazing time. Food was super good. Variety is the main thing over there. You will find really good options for your meal. Well behaved staffs will add extra comfortness. Will see u all soon again.
5.0,"Alot many dhaba in town, sounds like similar but its not the same. Dhaba originated from capital (Delhi). Real taste with original spices. We had Paneer tikka, paneer was so soft and nicely marinated. Then one of the best signature dish for which we heard from many ones BALTI MEAT simply loved it with special Dhabe di roti. Again their chicken was so soft n juicy simply licking my fingers.  Mentioning our server of the day Bijoy who took care very well.  Thank you"
5.0,"Best place to enjoy north Indian road side food,simply looks like road side Dhaba. great ambiance,nice service and outstanding food. must try Balti meat their signature dish"
2.0,"food was not good, we went with the team and almost everyone seemed to complain about the food taste of starters. Main course was slightly better. Staff is good, they make suggestions as necessary. Overall, came back unhappy because of the food."
4.0,"A good place to dine in & hang out with your friends and family. Good food with an ambience giving you the vibes of typical Indian dhabas. Sule Machi Tikka, Nargeesi Seekh, Rarrha gosht were on the plate. A small suggestion, need to work on nargeesi seekh as the mutton chop was overcooked. Zaleem Lassi is a must try :) A fine dining it was :)"
4.0,"A good place to have lunch or dinner with friends and family. The ambience is nice but kinda looks overdone. However, the staff is amazing. They were extremely sweet and welcoming. Now, coming to the food. We had ordered Khadayi Paneer, Dal Tadka, Masala Papad and Tandoori Roti. All the dishes were delicious but definitely not worth the price. Dal and Paneer is for 350 Rs. One Tandoori Roti is for 70 Rs.  I found the food to be really expensive. Also, if you have been to other North Indian Places in the town, you would not prefer going to this place again. There are better restaurants with less prices."
3.0,"Food was Ok not awesome. Starters are good, main course food is not spicy and chicken pieces are also not good quality. Food quality can be improved."
4.0,"My partner is very difficult to please when it comes to her penchant for her Dals and the high scrutiny to follow! After a lot of research, she has found her favorite Dal Makhani in town and this place has become a weekly routine of sorts, be it in place or home delivery.  Last weekend we had a good time there and tried some of the menu. Great ambience, friendly staff and an interesting dance performance by the staff to top it all off! Veg Galouti Kebab was good. Cold coffee felt diluted and too thin though. The Kaala Khatta flavoured LIIT drink was pretty good to taste but yet again felt diluted and could be better."
4.0,"Nothing special about the ambiance considering the price bracket they fall under. However, they really lift the mood with peppy Punjabi songs and I loved that part. Waiters are very polite and try their best to suggest dishes based on what you like. I tried the Sabz Burni which was too yummy. It had pickle flavor in it which was not overpowering. A lovely mix of vegetables that I couldn't stop licking off my fingers. Next I tried the Handi Gosht that had very nice brown colored gravy. Although, I did have an issue with the amount of meat on the mutton pieces. The next time I go there I'm gonna stick to Chicken. Teamed both these curries with Naan, Lachha Paratha and Roomali Roti all of which were soft and well cooked. I think the reason I'm going to remember this place is the desserts. Rabdi with Jalebi and the lovely Dhabe Da Meetha are a perfect way to end a meal."
4.0,Nice north indian food... The cutlery and ambience is typical of the dhabas on the punjab highways.. we tried the burni sabzi and chole .. worth a visit..
2.0,"We went to this place for a family dinner in a group of 10. Visit started with a situation as we got stuck in the lift with kids. The lift from starting gave a weird vibe. As the place is on 3rd floor and we were with senior citizens we went into the lift only to get stuck and start our evening with kids crying. Now comes the food part. We ordered Veg only. We ordered veg platter, Tandoori aloo, Lahsooni palak, bhindi masala, dal tadka, chole, garlic naan, tandoori roti, and jeera rice. Food was average and only thing which was upto the mark was tandoori aloo. Chole was really weird, being a punjabi restaurant we expected atleast chole to be good. Another thing which was really awkward was that the servers taking plates without asking. Two members who were still eating had their plates taken away. I think their were people waiting so they were asked by the manager to hurry up. Overall it was not a good dining experience. Food taste - 2.5/5 Ambience - 3.5/5 Quantity - 3/5 Quality - 3/5 Service - 2/5 Lift - better take stairs. Chances that I return - No chance."
4.0,"Ambience- 5 star Staff- 5 Star Veg Food- 3 star Non veg- 4 Over all experience was good, I ordered kahadi paneer and tawa mushroom and both were ok, I won't say it was great or bad but I had fun with my friend, My friends ordered non-veg and they loved it though, so for overall experience 4star"
1.0,"This is a very overrated place to be honest. The food is bland, no variety on drinks, and the desserts are pretty average. Plus the ambience is a total downer, and they add service charge to your bill without even informing you. Not Recommended."
5.0,"The place for delicious North Indian food and the lassi is to die for. Here the some dishes worth trying veg galauti kebabs, non veg platter, fish tikka, butter chicken, veg malai kofta and mutton curry. Nothing to complain about. Try this place when you some northy food cravings."
4.0,"Veg galouti kababs were excellent! Paneer Butter masala, garlic naan n amritsari khulcha were pretty good too. The Mushroom starter was average while masala papad was not any good. Still overall a good place with good north indian food n vibe!"
5.0,Awsome food taste and quantity. Surrounded by good companies..Also liked the ambience. Recommended for team lunch .. lunch time is good .. the service could be a bit fast
5.0,"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing music. I'll recommend the dal makhani and chhole. Do try the Cheese Garlic Tomato Naan. If you're from Punjab, this place will surely remind you of your hometown."
5.0,"If you are really looking for some finger licking north indian veg and nonveg food.. this is the place... -5/5 for ambiance -5/5 for food  -5/5 for value for money (appears to be on higher side but once you get the portion it's very much justifying) -5/5 for service and suggestions as per the group to place the order  We have done some crazy stuff and had our beer in Kullhadd for the first time. We ordered Bhatinda Chicken Curry which was just awesome, dal makhnai is famous n after having it we realised why its famous just out of the word and Palak lahsooni was also too good...!!!"
2.0,Two stars as we went only to have dessert. Especially Kesari phirni. The Phirni has to be chilled but it wasnt. Phirni is a kheer and yet there were not dry fruits in it. It was just plane rice grinded mixed with sugar and kesar thats what they are serving.
4.0,It is very good restaurant .great service by rajat.. come here mostly. Had chap and malai kofta and jaljeera .. everything is tasty .. frndly and cooperative staff
5.0,Loved chicken tikka and butter chicken here. Amazing service by devender. The vibe of the place is also nice. must visit if you love north indian food.
4.0,"The place is good for hanging out with your bros or family members when you want to have good quality conversation. The location is perfect as it is in the main Marathalli area and also, the menu is well thought through. They focused on adding quality food and not a lot of options which I personally prefer. Try the classic old butter chicken(it's totally worth it) with onion kulcha and rumali roti. Total fab  Lassi lovers can hog on mava lassi while having butter chicken. The only point I deducted was for this starter amritsar da kukad. Some people might prefer that overcooked charcoal flavor but for me, it didn't click somehow.  Will surely visit again.   Ambience: 4 Food and presentation: 4 Staff:5 Location: 5"
3.0,"Food is simply amazing. We order Paneer Butter Masala, Kofta, Tandoori, Roomali Roti and Kulcha. Most of it was good except the Roomali Roti which was cold. Also, the place is highly expensive. Keep a check on that as well. Ambience is decent and location is good too"
4.0,"A great place to have authentic North Indian food. The kebabs, gravies,bread, rice preparations to true to the actual tastes. The only qualm was that I think it is on the more pricey side. To my surprise the prices vary between the indiranagar and marathahalli joint too of the same restaurant. Would recommend a visit though."
4.0,"Great ambiance !! Loved the interior, delicious food !! I have uploaded a picture which I loved the most in my Instagram account,  Sweet was really good.. but a bit pricey compared to quantity"
5.0,Dal Makhini and Veg Platter of this place is worth to go for. Ambience is nice and Zomato Gold is must if you visit this place cause of its cost.
5.0,"Delicious food and very hygiene. A bit expensive though, but worth giving a try. Ambience is good , punjabi cuisine is best relatively. Would visit again!"
4.0,Nice ambeince..Staff was friendly and we liked dance performance by them...Food was amazing specially paneer and dal.However masala papad was a disappointment. Further they are charging bomb for 2 very small pieces of pan so think before ordering pan...Overall a nice experience
5.0,This place gives you feel of having proper dhaba food. The blend of masala n spices are perfect.It is of the my personal favourite restuarants . No matter if gou order veg or non-veg the food will be absolute yummy..
5.0,Excellent service was well taken care of. Appreciate the staff. They were extremely friendly and helpful in getting what I wanted. Kudos. Will come again
4.0,Ambience 5/5 Food 5/5 ( only problem is breads. Roti isn't good compared to the main course) Staff 5/5 Value for money 5/5 (if you've zomato gold)
5.0,It's a place worth a visit. One of the best place to have north Indian food. It's bit on expensive side but I used zomato gold and it costed me 700 for two people.
2.0,"The Dhaba failed to live up to the hype as many recommended. The ambience is absolutely beautiful with a mix of retro & rustic, however the food is a complete let down. Prices are quite high.  The buffet on a Friday was very average. Most of the dishes had excessive oil and lack of flavor especially the Bhindi masala and Paneer Curries, the chats and roti were very good though.  Chicken biryani, the meat was too dry and masala was way too tasteless, though you could see masala.  A highly priced place for below average food, wouldn't miss anything if you skip this restaurant. Service is great & courteous."
5.0,"I got to visit Dhaba which is located at Marathahalli. Before visiting I have heard that Dhaba serves one of the best Punjabi foods in Bangalore and after trying out their food it is definitely true. The ambience is such that it gives a Punjabi feel, adding to that was the friendly service by the staff which gave me an amazing experience at this place. I was able to taste the food from different Dhabas around India and I have learnt that there is so much into Indian food than there is. Hats off to chef for preparing such delicious food.  Masala Papad  So I started off with a Masala Papad and a glass with a glass of old monk. The masala papad was topped with onions, tomatoes and spices it was so flavourful. It is a perfect munching option that was paired with Old Monk.  Chicken Manchurian  The next dish that came out was the Chicken Manchurian which was a mix of Punjabi and Chinese flavours alternatively can be called as Chingabi.  Sanghi galassi  It was a collection of drinks from different parts of India . These were the palette cleansers which refreshed the taste buds.  Galouti Kebab  Now the dish that came next captivated me was this dish the Galouti Kebab. It was pure delight which just melted in my mouth literally and I was literally blown off.  Amritsari Kukkad  Marinated with spices that are whole and not grounded. So that you get that flavouring in the chicken. It is lighter flavoured chicken dish that I have come across till date.  Balti meat   The signature dish of Dhaba, that pairs so beautifully with the Missi Roti. Loved the curry it was delicious.  Bhatinda chicken curry  I love most about this dish is the warmth and the soothing colour of the curry which is just the comfort that goes along with Butter Garlic Naan and Dhaba De Roti  My favorite was the Galouti Kebab.  If you want to taste some really great North Indian cusine I would definitely recommend Dhaba.

4.0,"We went to Dhaba for lunch last day. I will come directly to the review  1. If you have ZOMATO GOLD then this place will be a good deal. 2. This is my second visit to the place. Like the last time this time also I liked everything about their food. We ordered Highway Special Chicken Tikka(properly marinated and cooked) , Palak Paneer(traditional and authentically made), lachha paratha and Ganne juice wala mocktail. The mocktail was really really drool worthy with some pudina and nimbu flavour in it. 3. Located at very busy street the place does not have a proper parking I felt. They do have a valet parking but last time when we got our car there were loads of mud on the wheels. This time they said parking was full and we had to go to Innovative Multiplex and then park our car."
3.0,We decided to stop over at this place after a long drive for lunch on Saturday. Opted this place based on the 4.3 rating and wanted some North Indian veg food for a cuz who was visiting us.  Place does give you a North Indian feel and we placed orders for veg and non veg. Mutton sheek kababs and some potato fry with honey. Channa masala and butter chicken with some naans and kulchas. Lassi to water down the food.  The food on the whole was nice nothing to write home about but what happened as a gold member is what I am totally ticked off about.   So we ordered about 4 main courses and I checked in with zomato gold. When the bill was brought back I realised they hadnt subtracted the 2nd highest item on the bill but rather the 4th highest item.  I informed the waiter and he said he will get it corrected but ended up coming and saying that they could only offer the gold for the 2nd starter that I ordered. To which I contested and so the manager came by and gave me this concocted idea that since I ordered two starters the second one is free and surprisingly to our luck we ordered the second veg starter towards the end so his dumb logic didnt fly so much so he got angry with the waiter who served us well and told him to get out. Feel sorry for the waiter and tried to see if I could get to speak to him before we left but couldnt. This experience is not something I would like repeat so I really feel the zomato gold doesnt live up to the hype it is   This is not the first time restaurants have come up with weird ideas of how to inconvenience the customer who uses zomato gold
1.0,Today first time i visited Dhaba but it was just below average . Food are tasteless and expensive too. I ordered food which includes Tandoori roti that cost 59 rs each ...very thin and small roti...i don't know on what basis they are charging so much....
3.0,"The ambiance is  great I mean full punjabi,  but the food is not good at all I tried this place two times both veg and non veg are in the same condition not good in taste. The table service is very good and is at the perfect location."
3.0,Go here if you have Zomato gold!!! The place was packed as it was the weekend.. The main feedback I have is there is a thin line between fast service and shoving the food in front of peoples faces.. The guy who took our order was busy looking everywhere else except paying attention to what I was ordering.. Food could have been served a little more politely instead of just rushing to it.. One of us had asked for water. He poured it for the one who asked and everyone else also but by the time he reached my glass there was hardly anything left but he still did not refill.. Such things matter the most no matter how the food is. The only person who smiled through the chaos in their restaurant and was courteous was the receptionist..  No complaints about the food.. Mawa lassi was fantastic..  Might definitely not be sure about another visit..
4.0,"Taste was good, starters and mutton curry in main course was awesome. All items are bit costly, even water bottle costs 120rs and 10% service charge."
5.0,A very casual dining setting. Typical Dhaba-like food menu. Decent music. Tasty food and great service. Decent place for frequent visits and casual outings.
5.0,The service and staff is very nice. Soya chap is a must try. Ambience is also good. Staff is very friendly and cooperative. U get swad toffee that is the best
4.0,"we went for a team lunch the ambience is like dhaba crossovers modern bars .The mutton seekh kebab was good,biryani wasnt that interesting though."
5.0,"Awesome ambience , good food , good surrounding ....feels like , you actually on pure Punjabi dhaba .. with Desi style . Food is really great , me and my friend order handi murgh and butter chicken 1986 with butter naan ...item is really tasty .... ghar wali felling aajayegi ......and last one is special Punjabi lassi ..one of the favorite ...."
5.0,Today my first Visit in the dhaba.marathali And I'm Found Something punjabi style Model food . trust me this is the one only Restaraunt of full punjabi styl .nice dance batamiiz dil .and there staff is very quickly Service Specially thanks kailash good going .i will come soon again.
5.0,"Amazing place. Nice ambience. The food is simply superb. Ordered a veg galouti kebab and it was so soft, it melted right into the mouth. The main course was charming too. We couldn't decide what to have but then a courteous table keeper Devendra suggested to have their famous Dal Makhni and kadai paneer. Truth be told, I was a little skeptical when it came to dal makhni as I generally find it boring in Bangalore. But to my surprise this dal makhni was out of the world. Super creamy and had an amazing taste. Ordered an extra Naan just to gobble up the Makhni :) lovely place, would love to go again"
5.0,"Devendra offered really good hospitality, food was awesome! Will come back again soon! Soya chap was yummy! Very good restaurant overall. Would recommend."
5.0,Absolutely amazing food ... being a punjabi you will gonna love it!! Went twice food is so good as always.. Must visit place for all North Indian specially
5.0,The food and service was really awesome Service by Devendra was really welcoming... Things to improve would be the lassi which was expensive and not worth it.
5.0,"A very nice place to hangout with your friends and family, with awesome food. Loved their theme, a must place to visit if living near Marathahalli"
5.0,If you are in a mood of Bollywood night and a great food this is the place to be. The place is designed like a road side dhaba and gives a very rustic look. The service Staffs are also really good. The taste of food is something which they can work on a bit.
5.0,This place is so good! One of the best places to relish the perfect North Indian taste. The service was quite good and polite and swift. (Though we went on a non rush hour of Monday!) There is a wide range of Starters and Main course to choose from and also many drinks options! The place has a huge seating so always hope to have seating in busy restaurant hours. But what strike me most is the ambience of the place. It's very colourful and cool. 5 Stars!
3.0,"Ambience is just okay, prices are high. Food quantity was a lot. We had ordered mutton galouti kebab which was great, however the musroom gravy was not up to the mark."
3.0,"Good Food, Fast Service, Friendly staff but too pricey for a moderate ambience......Avoid drinks, mocktails......below average preparation....Deducting 2 starts for price...."
4.0,The place was quite noisy and nobody was dancing. We chose a table far away from the DJ. Food was yummy... got the authentic taste there. Bit costly for the average ambience.
5.0,"Delicious food!!! Mutton was so tender in mutton curry, butter chicken was amazing even lacchs paratha was excellent. Staff is polite and friendly!! Keep it up!!!"
5.0,"Dhabha is like a home away from home! It is one of the rarest places in Bangalore which serves authentic Punjabi food!! Their Dal Makhni tastes exactly the way it is prepared in North India, and is the must have along with garlic Naans, this is something we regularly eat but today we decided to  have full course meal along with starters, mocktails, main course and of course dessert and lassi!!   We started our meal with veg platter which included Tawa onion mushrooms, soya chaap, bhune aooloo and Veg Galouti kebab!! Everything was amazing but Veg Galouti Kebab stole the show, they tasted so authentic like purani delhi ke kebab and almost melted in the mouth!! Both the chicken started were rocking and the presentation was next level in a smoked iron box!   We tried multiple mocktails such as Gane ka Ras, jaljeera, rangeela, virgin Anaarkali etc etc and our favourite of all of them was Rangeela which is made up of Kafir Lime and passion fruit!  Main course cannot be complete without Dal Makhni and Butter Chicken and again with Aunthentic Delhi vala taste!!  Dinner cant be completed without having wonderful desserts, and we had the best Dhabhe da meetha which was like multiple desserts in one bowl- the lowermost layer had  vannila ice cream, topped with shahi tukra, rabri and cherry gulab jamun on top!! Super yum!!  overall 5/5 with great ambience, food and service!!"
5.0,"Amazing taste even though a bit expensive. As always, their Dal Makni is the best! One of the best restaurants. Best place for North Indian food."
3.0,"went for team lunch here- this is ala cartey restaurant (but they accomadate lunch buffet) - starters were servered to the table (good), main course (average) and dessert (avg again)  taste - 3/5 ambience- 3/5 service - 2.5/5 (we went around 40+ ppl - more time to get each time) value for money- 3/5"
4.0,"Awesome Punjabi 'traditional' Ambience. We ordered Highway Chicken Tikka, Balti Meat, Paneer Makkhan Maar Ke, Khadai Mushroom, Naans, Rotis and Sweet Lassi. The food was great in taste but in terms of money the quantity was not worth it. It appears to be as costly even after applying Zomato Gold. The service was fine. Had a quality time anyways. With Sudeep Naskar Pushkarsh Sinha Abhishek Dhar Siga Davidson Vijay Lakhmani Surya Shree"
1.0,Thums up Price 35 per can and dhaba price 149 per can. Food was good and don't order any soft drinks it's not worth it. Check the bill and get surprise
5.0,"Bejoy was very attentive and very soft spoken guy. He managed to make sure what we like we should get on time. I wish him all the future success here, he is rock star for me"
4.0,Good ambience and great service!!! Tasty food  Non veg Buffet costs around 800 including tax which is worth it. A must visit place. Located near More store in Marathahalli
4.0,"Lovely and different food experience from this one. Not a Dhaba per se. A royal one, maybe  There's also a dance during dinner time wherein the waiters, chefs and other people join. A great sight"
5.0,Love the place with beautiful ambience and Food here is really amazing. good for family and friends.love to come here again. Taste of the food is always delicious . Makes me happy
1.0,Not at all worth the money. Taste is not good. Also frequent loud birthday music can be disturbing. And now just writing to complete 140 letters.
1.0,"Hard kebabs, time pass rotis, gravies kind of ok.  Over priced and nothing great. I do not recommend spending here at all. There are many other north Indian options around."
5.0,The ambience of the place is really good. The dj's music collection was amazing. The staff was really polite and helpful. One of the places I would definitely recommend you if you are looking for a place to just sit down and spend a nice time with your friends. Food was also good and hygienic.
1.0,Used to order from this place even though it is on the costlier side but this time the dal was so watery and tasteless. Really disappointed and will think again before ordering.
4.0,Why not Prices listed on Menu? Its good is prices are displayed. It is easier for people to decide. Please take it as a feedback and reveal the prices of items in your menu
2.0,"Extremely overpriced and taste is also not very good. Quantity of food is very less. Water bottle costed Rs 115. Apart from gst, you have to pay service charge.  If you are going only for having food, it is waste of money, mood and time.  Ordered butter chicken which costed 389 (without service charge and gst), and the taste was way different than butter chicken and chicken was present in traces. Taste of Amritsari kukkad okay. All the naans were bad in tatse compared to other restaurants.  Taste 1.5/5 Ambience 3/5 Quantity of food 1.5/5 Hospitality 4/5 Value for money 1/5  Comparing with other restaurants nearby such as Jalsa Gold and Float, my suggestion to go here is a big NO."
4.0,We went twice here but once we tried ala carte and second time Buffet. In ala carte we ordered panner and some regular ones which were good. In Buffet we had some starters only for veg and chats as initial dishes. We dont have much options in main dishes and desserts are like ok ok. Service is little poor and we have to wait a lot for each order.
2.0,"Found the food to be decent, though music was blasting very very loud and they refused to correct the volume, we with our 4 year old kid had to rush through"
5.0,"probably putting this review bit late as dined in this very place couple of months back, enjoyed the place to the core, it was the birthday of my better half and the staff over there made it special by celebrating it with us and dancing on a famous Bollywood number, excellent place to have a authentic Indian food."
5.0,"one of the best north indian restaurant in the city, super quick service and tasty food complements each other really well, ambiance is very catchy, will be on the top of my list from now on whenever will come out to dine."
2.0,"Its over rated. we had buffet lunch, starter were all good but when it comes to main course they had limited categories and food was just ok.  Main disappointment is things are too costly. we ordered just lemonade without seeing the menu card and they charged around 300/- for each glass :( it was really surprise for that kind of restaurant."
3.0,Food was good but they took an hour to to bring food on table. Paneer butter masala and chicken Tikka was very good. Please don't order lassi here.
5.0,"Food was good.,specially badam halwa. It is awesome if you badam halwa fan. Sabzi is also good in taste. Its a value for money place. Liked it"
2.0,"I was there for a casual dinner, felt the prices a bit over than expected. The food was okayish. The Hatke factor was missing. Being so over priced, I expected something unique.  the ambiance was good and the service was friendly. But I wont recommend this place for a second time."
5.0,What a kadhai paneer !!! Real fan of your kadhai paneer. Also the staff is very very friendly. Give it a try ! Good place to hangout. Prices are a little high.
5.0,The restaurant has good food and good liquor... Non veg is not that great but veg is great... We ordered paneer items and all were awesome..
5.0,Nice ambience with great songs. I liked the food as well. We have ordered   Dhaba paneer tikka as starter - 3/5 Main course - Paneer Makhan waala - 5/5 but too spicy. Although restaurant did give us other paneer curry because I couldnt had it Garlic Nan - 3/5 it should have more garlic Amritsari Kulcha - 5/5 too good Presentation- was good Response was quick in order taking and managing
1.0,"Out of all the places that I visited in Bengaluru, this has been the most disappointing of them all. Having visited other Dhaba outlets in other cities, this was my recommendation and I repent to have gone here. This place just doesn't have a life. Staff don't seem to be interested in serving and look like they are being forced to do the job. Almost all of them look tired and there's absolutely no energy or smile. Perhaps, time for them to reinvent what they were good at. We opted for buffet and the food nor service were that of Dhaba standards. Starters were dry and didn't seem to be fresh. The feedback shared went to deaf ears. Main course had the same problem with dry food without moisture in them. Desserts were lifeless and tasteless. There are better options in the locality and I may prefer trying other options in the future."
4.0,"Great food and nice ambience  Do try dal makhani, chicken haandi and aam Panna. For deserts Ras Malai is a must try. Give it a shot if you want some nice north Indian food in Bangalore."
5.0,"Good staff, even better food. The dal makhani is to die for. Good ambiance and very courteous people run the place and you can rest assured knowing youll be treated well."
3.0,Food is tasty and service is also fine but the dishes are quite experience. One more thing this restraunt don't except zomato gold for all the dishes.
4.0,"Good buffet spread, dhaba thed ambience.May be a one time visit kinda place. Can improve on the service during peak hours. Got jaljeera in the name of shikanji"
5.0,Awesome Food and Ambience. The dance by all the staff was too good which added more glamour to the evening and Uttam Kumar Sahoo was very polite and courteous.
4.0,"Good Food, Great Ambience, Helpful staffs and everything is Awesome, just a bit overpriced but you will have an awesome time if you go with group of friends."
4.0,"A really good place to visit. A bit pricey, yes but the food was good. Overall Ambience - 4/5 Food - 3.5/5 Cost - 2.5/5 (1 being highly priced)"
5.0,"Mild and appetizing taste,awesome ambience...good for team parties and a la carte food. Had an amazing time with the team... food varieties are very good."
4.0,"Big dhaba style indoor seating . We ordered gulab lassi that had loads of gulkand flavour and came in a huge kullad glass - very refreshing. Naan , dal tadka and paneer every thing was very flavorful and tasted really dhaba style . We ordered potato crisps that was equally good , made in Indian style with khatai on it .The portion size is big and value for money"
1.0,Go for the food but stay away if you love your Car. They have awkward parking arrangement where parking place is owned by courier company which keeps operating heavy metal trolleys. Our car was damaged and post that hotel manager behaved very rudely without acknowledging the issue.
5.0,Nice ambience Food is good Nice staff  This restaurant is nice for fimaly I visited with my family good food. I visited very soon. Very nice all mocktal
1.0,"I ordered soya chaap masala..and its pathetic in taste, the quantity is very less...not value for money. Will not order next time from this place"
3.0,"Its overrated I felt, not worth the money. I had mocktail-which was not too good. Paneer Kadhai-not extraordinary, have eaten much better in smaller restaurants than this. Naan was too hard. Service is quite fast though. I didnt like it overally. But looking forward to have NV here, will be posting a review soon regarding that.Oh and ya, do parcel your leftovers, that is the only thing I liked about this place, the bag and box they provided while parcelling. Haha :D  #happyeating :)"
4.0,Worth visit! Food and hospitality was nice. Ambience is okay okay. Food is little over priced. But they have a lot of options in Veg. Over all taste was good
4.0,"Personally, we didn't like the Chicken. Apart from that, food was great. Mojito is a must try from this place! It has a great DHABA ambience, be ready to get clicked."
5.0,"Very nice ambience...if you want proper desi feel,do visit once. tasty north indian food good staff.very good service by uttam sahu Good music must visit specially for north indians.."
5.0,"The food and the service both were really good..The staff was very polite and helpful in getting us the perfect items as per our taste buds!  My 4th or 5th visit to the place!  Ordered bhindi masala and paneer tikka masala which was perfectly cooked with right blend of spices.. Overall, a must go for food lovers"
5.0,The decor of Dhaba really gives you the feel that you're eating at an authentic Dhaba. The menu is not vast which is great as they focus on a chosen selection of dishes. Wound highly recommend the Murg Gosht
5.0,"If you ever want to get the real taste of North Indian food, do visit this place. On top of it they played top chartbusters of Bollywood through out the night. I tried a flavour of Lassi (which I don't remember :/) but it was really good."
4.0,"For a perfect authentic Punjabi food this is the place. It doesn't disappoint us. Though priced a bit high, it is worth. Their rotis are very good and paneer based curries too tastes great. I like their interiors with Dhaba based theme."
3.0,"I understand the place has 4.4 rating but may be thats because of the ambience or staff courtesy or their buffet. We ordered ala Carte and it was not worth something above 3 or 3.5. We ordered veg galouti kabab, chicken, paneer masala and breads. Veg Galouti kabab was sweet which was the first disappointment, Chicken should have been cooked little more and the gravy should have been mixed properly, they were not complimenting each other. Paneer masala was nice and the savior. Breads were decent. Overall I was not too satisfied. By the name and reviews i was hoping to get a real North Indian flavour (hopefully Delhi) but it is not there yet. You can easily skip this for Jalsa Gold or Gramin anytime."
4.0,"Dhaba Estd is a place for North Indian food. The taste of food is definitely good and so is the ambience of this place. I visited with my family and had a good time over dinner. Dal makhni was very good and authentic. Perhaps, one of the best ones in Bengaluru. Malai Kofta was just average and not so great. However, the portion served was large even for two people. Garlic Naan was as usual good. Tandoori Roti was much better and also easy on the stomach. It was soft and tasted good. Service was below average and the staff didn't attend us well. We had to call them so many times when they would actually listen and come. Ambience is good and matches the theme well."
5.0,"According to me this place serves best authentic Punjabi meal. You shouldn't believe me until you taste it. The staff is amicable , Bijoy and Gaurav were my hosts and trust me they knew their job. The quantity of food is ideal ,actually it's more than expected and definitely you would be delighted once you have it. The only teeny tiny issue I have is with the price of beverages , lassi for 229 ...hard to believe right ? No complaints about the taste though , but Mr. Owner if you are reading this ..can any changes be made ?  Anywho I love to come here and you must too   We got rabdiii as a complimentary side ...( Just telling )"
4.0,"Went for a dinner of 4members since had an idea of having alacarte and went where the staffs were very friendly and the service was very nice but when comes to food had a mixed options where we started with #NVPLATTER which disappointed highly (the kebabs were over cooked) for main course ordered #Daldhabba(makhini)and #BHATINDA CHICKEN CURRY and few naans the dhal melted in mouth which is simply awesome out of the world so dint concentrated on the chicken curry but frds said it was nice,I dint wanted to have any desserts since it may dilute my dhal flavour but with compulsion had gulab jamun which is out of the world Over all a nice place for Punjabi food but literally over costed, total damage for the wallet is 3003 which is higher for the food we had."
5.0,Had an amazing dining experience here. The food was too good. The staff were courteous and friendly. The ambience was amazing too! It's a must visit!
5.0,Awesome Punjabi theme based restaurant. Crowded place and live music is very good. Food quality and service was awesome. A good experience on a team lunch.
3.0,We tried kebab platter and a few dishes in the main course. Most of the items on platter were a let down - esp the soya chaap. But the main course items which were recommended by the waiter were quite tasty and I think every one should just go with their recommendations. One more let down was that there was no soup/shorba on the menu.
5.0,"Ambience- Contemporary with a twist Food- Quantity is good enough for 2 and the flavour is absolutely Lip Smacking. Balti Meat texture and flavor is out of the world. Staffs are really courteous and very helpful. i was accompanied by a senior citizen and we were taking buffet , the went par in terms of service and served each and every thing from buffet on the table for my Grandfather. its very hard to get this kind of gesture from restaurants nowadays. please intact the same taste and service.Thank you guys for a wonderful experience"
3.0,Overpriced. Mutton balti was good. Rabri was not good.It tastes like milk cake . Ambience is ok. Staffs are friendly. Service was slow. Not worth to revisit.
3.0,Ambience : 4/5 Food : 4/5 Service : 2/5 Price : 3/5  The people who are servicing are too careless. They don't get you the things until you say them multiple times.  They made me to wait for 15 min to even get the final bill. I don't know how they were generating it though.  I felt some of the food items are overpriced for the quality/quantity they provide.  The waiters are too ignorant.

5.0,"Recommended by my friend, came to try out this place for the first time, Indeed it was a wow experience. Love the food, their mawe lassi which is dry fruit lassi was the besttry this lassi if you are a lover of lassi. Over all it was a great experience with lovely ambience."
3.0,"A resto-bar that dreamt of a dhaba.   The place is a rather schizophrenic version of a dhaba, with some jarring decor looking out of character. It does have the noise of a dhaba though. Ambience : 2 on 5  The highlight was the food, it was satiating even though quite ordinary. The gravy was yummy and not oily, however the paneer felt like it was just added to the gravy. The roti were good and not rubbery even when cold. I ordered Mawa lassi expecting creamy goodness on top, but the mawa was nuts. It was yummy nonetheless. Firnee was flavourful but seemed dry. I'd give food 4 on 5.   Service was okayish, nothing out of ordinary. A metric of evaluation - my glass of water was empty for long time. They brought plain tandoori roti while I had ordered with butter. Maybe the management needs to improve.  Service : 3 on 5"
4.0,Biryani over here is a must try. Service was good. Ambience is good but could be better. A bit expensive but is worth. Surely visiting again.

4.0,"Recently I had ordered chicken do pyaaza. The packaging was nice. Delivery was also prompt. Price was 329 inr. It had 2big and 2small chicken pieces which I think is less. They can increase the quantity. Taste was above average not bad,not something brilliant. In all good experience."
4.0,A nice place to visit and hangout with your friends. The ambience is good. The food is good. Do try the Punjabi Sabjis here. We had paneer Makhan masala and kadai paneer along with butter rotis.

2.0,"My wife and I went to Dhaba on 14th Feb based on a friends recommendation; and also due to high rating on Zomato. However, I didnt find this place worthy of 4.4 rating  We ordered the famous non veg platter. I was very disappointed with the taste and portion size. They charged an exorbitant amount for this selection but taste wise I did not feel it was worth it. Amritsari fish was too oily & bland, chicken tasted like preservative and Mutton kabab was okay. The serving staffs were prompt and very friendly.  Due to disappointing starter served to us we decided not to go for the main course. We had very high expectations from this place but turned downed by the food served to us."
5.0,Visited Dhaba after being recommended by friends and colleagues. The staff were cheerful and ambiance . Wonderful hospitality shown by Suraj Squeak and Aditya
5.0,This place has an amazing ambience accompanied with great food and amazing service. We went for Valentine's lunch with my colleague and they were having a offer on 1+1 on their signature cocktails. somras and toofan cocktails were awesome. loved the way they hv written for valentine's offer on black board. simply awesome. Table reservation is recorded on weekends.
5.0,"After hearing so much about this place from my friends.Finally came here for Dinner with my family. The Decor is lovely,the food here is great,try the Anarkali drink it is the best mocktail I should say.The unexpected dance by the staffs made our evening more enjoyable. Special thanks to Bijoy suraj for his awesome service."
5.0,"Came here for lunch with my team,this is my third time coming to Dhaba,food and service here never disappoint me. Kudos to the Team Lovely place to enjoy with friends or family."
4.0,Food was delicious...but you will have to wait bit long to taste the food because their service is very slow. Ambience also is very nice. One can choose this place for special occasions. But they should mention average cost as Rs 1500 for 2.
5.0,"Went this restaurant for the first time, name of the restaurant is to gud as their food is, and thiem with beautiful quotes just loved it. Tasty food with gud staf"
5.0,"So today we went to this place after hearing a lot about it and I was not at all disappointed. They have this amazing north Indian food, nice ambiance and the service is too friendly. If you love North Indian food, this place is a must try."
5.0,There Dal Makhani and Kadhai Paneer are to die for. Perfect place for a family lunch or dinner. I felt their price is slightly on the higher side but its definitely worth a try.
1.0,We are very disappointed with the food quality..The curries are very very oily and also gobi was tasteless with huge slices of potatoes..The dhaba roti also was totally tasteless. The food is very costly compared to other similar restaurants.
5.0,"Though their ambience and service alone are enough to make you visit this place twice , their divine food will definitely make you fall in love with them. Their a la carte menu is extensive and the buffet is a must try. This place is one of those rare ones which is apt for both friends and family."
4.0,Nice Delhi style food good ambience good place to hangout with friends and family.Prompt and quick service definitely good place for Delhi style food
5.0,Awesome food and ambience. Good theme of Punjabi and Bollywood spread all over the walls. They did a dance on some famous punjabi music and were joined by some people from the audience as well.
4.0,Nice ambience and courteous staff. We like the bar menu and the presentation style. The booking experience was smooth and so was the table allocation.
5.0,"Courteous staff...They break into a dance on weekend nights..Lively ambience, great food...Usually a wait...Best to reserve table in advance"
1.0,Be careful. I ordered Jack Daniels 60ml and they gave me less than that at same cost. And they are enjoying that they made some profits. Cheap tricks. I am regular customer there and they fooled me. So I will never visit again and also suggest my friends to be visit.
5.0,"Very alive and family type place. So much of possitive vibes. Food is decent. Not very spicy which is a plus point. It's always crowded on weekends coz of the demand but despite that it's super awesome n comfortable. Staff us very friendly, polite n super fast! MUST GO with ur family place"
4.0,"The experience was good. The staffs were friendly and the service was good. Ambience is also nice but it became full crowded as we went on weekends. The food tastes were very good specially all the items present in the veg platter, we loved all the items. Price is little on the high side but overall experience was good."
4.0,"Was a great place. Nice ambience, vibrant mood and amazing finger licking food. Tried the buffet at lunch. They had good variety in non veg. Starts with a welcome drink, followed by starters. We were full even before we reached main course, but couldn't resist the authentic punjabi cuisine. Must go place."
3.0,Ambience is great. Liked the starters. Disappointed with the biryani. Courteous staff. Can visit for once. One of the nice place for north indian food.
5.0,Had a good time at this visit we tried dal and Kala chicken it was too tasty the service was very good and they have funky quotes on the walls my server was Bimla and bijoy they did a good job... Will be back soon
1.0,Been there as the reviews was good. Disppointed....Service is very slow we had to wait for long to get simple thing like butter milk and onion. Food taste is below average compare to price charged. Food is not worth the amount paid. Will never visit this place again.
5.0,The place was quite big they have elaborated buffet which a person can incomplete the full... But we took the own menu choice ... asit was well trained and professional we loved the dal and the butter chicken. Overall my experience was very nice and the dance was eye treat
5.0,"Great Ambience and authentic taste of food, the drinks menu is also good. Good service from the staff even the crowd was more. Good for a team lunch or dinner, valet parking is also an added advantage"
4.0,"A place about which I heard a lot.so decided to have a visit . Initially was thinking of going to Indira nagar outlet but considering the traffic decided to go for this one. Nice place with very good ambience . Full of Punjabi quotes and impressive decor. Food were tasty as u expect from most of the Punjabi style restaurants. I felt price were on the higher side but when I saw the food quantity I think that was justified. They have various separate counters like liquor counter , milk.product counter with some interesting Punjab name given to it Place was over crowded . Wait time was very high . Only one person taking table request and keeping track of that . This need to be improved for hasle free experience .otherwise , it was a nice experience  Rating can go below as : Food - 4/5 Ambience - 4.5/5 Service - 3.5 /5 Overall - 4/5"
5.0,This place is for all the foodies! Ambience-5/5 You get a complete urban dhaba feel. The food gets served in heavy copper vessels. The like and feel will put you in a dhaba in your imaginations  Hospitality- 5/5 The staffs are very polite. They are always around and ready to help. The service is extremely fast Food- We chose the option of buffet and every dish on the plate had flavour and taste. Both veg and non veg dishes are good- real good! Dont miss the desserts!!  But they save their best for last:) They serve swad. If you have had these toffees in your childhood; you will leave this place carrying happy nostalgic memories!
4.0,Food was okish. Waiters were well mannered and well behaved. Ambeience is very good. We order paneer Tikka in starter that was great. In main course paneer butter masala was not up to expectations.
4.0,This is a decent Punjabi restaurant with good Dhaba ambiance inside. The food used to be good but may not be the best. The chaas is really good out here.
1.0,Very poor food.  Sub jhalfrezi was bland in taste. Roomali roti was not cooked properly. All in all this place can be easily avoided. The service also needs to improve a lot
4.0,Food is great. Seating and ambiance is good too. They have actually out loud music to their advantage. Can take the help for staff to choose plus they're all courteous.
4.0,"I liked this place a lot, the ambiance was good and very friendly staff. There was a moment when the songs started playing loud and we were confused, what was happening, then all of a sudden the staff started giving a dance performance and that was fabulous.  Food quality was amazing. Good for office or family dine out."
1.0,Very expensive and food was not worth the money !! There are far better dhaba kind of restaurants which provide better food and at reasonable prices. The only good thing was ambience added by the karaoke singer.
4.0,"Summary :decent north Indian food  Order :the lunch buffet  Food (4/5) : Must try the kulcha with chole  Ambiance (4/5) : The effort is there to make the restaurant feel like a road side dhaba of north india, the copper glasses and plates, the refreshment bottles, the graphetti on the walls etc give the 'dhaba feel'.  Value for money (3.5/5)"
5.0,Nice authentic place and great food. Balti meat was out of this world. Very nicely cooked meat with amazing gravy. Gajar (carrot) ka Halwa is also delicious and is perfect after having a full meal. Nice ambience and people are also very friendly. Good comfortable seating with delicious food Devendra! Good Job man. Really happy with your attitude and hardwork.
5.0,The food is good as always. Paneer makhni and malai kofta is finger licking good!!! And the staff is also corteous and nice specially asit. 5/5
5.0,"Sweet people acknowledging a slightly delayed service with complimentary sweets.  The staff is very polite, especially Uttam Bhui and go all out to make it a good experience. Very authentic Dhaba food with amazing Kaali daal... Im sure the Dehli folks will love it!!!"
5.0,Been to the same place for third time...pretty decent for drinks & dinner..Dal Dhaba & Veg Galouti is always the best on Dhaba Estd menu in both the outlet.
4.0,The place is awesome..and delicious Punjabi food. Had a great time. Chilly chicken and Dal Tadka were the best.. The ambience was good too. Staff was polite and there was not much delay in food delivery as well. They can add some soup options in their menu. Must try food in this restaurant
5.0,"Place was good , even manager and service was great .. They helped us to make our zomato gold uses most of it . Food was delicious , how ever quantity is little less ."
4.0,Authentic  north indian taste. Baalti meat is just amazing. Highway chicken tikka is too a must try. Overall full marks for taste. Can improve the service. Faced some delay in orders due to friday rush but they could have managed better.
5.0,Asit served us very well and the service was very good and fast and even the food quality was awesome.Must visit place... Try paneer chilli masala sabji for sure... Butter naan and roti both are very soft and delicious
4.0,"The food is great, the butter chicken was super butter-y and tasted absolutely amazing. Do try the chicken dishes and Daal makhani here, it has such a rich flavor. Perfect place for some north Indian food cravings in the area."
2.0,"The food did not meet our expectations. Being a big fan of malai kofta I ordered the dish but ended up very disappointed, one advice do not order malai kofta here, it was literally Gulaab jamun dipped in a creamy gravy which had no flavours other than sweet, less salt, no spice flavour, no other element, just sweet. My friend ordered mutton which wasn't good either. The missi roti and garlic naan were okayish. We just went there because of high ratings but were quite disappointed. The only good part about the place was Asit who  assisted us very warmly and was quick on service"
4.0,"The ambience is superb The cost is pretty high , though the taste is too good but the quantity is very low. The only drawback is they add their own service tax inspire of including gst ...so when u visiting please check the bill if they have added any service tax make sure u ask them to remove.."
5.0,"I've been to many North Indian restaurants but this one was neither planned nor ever thought of going. Suddenly today while coming back from shopping went to Dhaba to try the foods. Which came out with many surprises.  It's near to Radisson Blu plaza, Marathahalli ,near the highway easy to locate. After reaching there I found out that it was fully rushed so I planned to have my dinner there only. Though my queue no. Was 40 still I got the table in 15-20 mins. But keep in my if you're visiting with family or group please book/reserve table first before coming.  The interior is just like pure Punjabi Look (*pics attached) Usual truck in the front, live bar, large dinning area, Pics of Kusti and the list of winners are hanging there in the wall. And many more.  Now the Food :  We didn't ordered much as we were already half full still we ordered Plain Naan,Balti Meat and the chef's special Burni Murgh ( Chef Ravi Saxena's recipe by lanes of Amritsar).  Balti Mutton was properly Cooked and medium spicy and the thick gravy was delicious.  chef's special Chicken was the main attraction of our dinner. Spices and with a slight touch of pickles made it something different and taste was too good.  Many people have concerns about the price. Fyi I would like to tell you the price of the curry and all are same as around Bangalore but the desserts you can say a bit costly.  The staffs are polite, friendly , sober, faster and with a smile in their face while serving made our day.  Find the following ratings: Food: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Staff and services: 5/5  In over all I can say one of the best place for North Indian/Punjabi foods in Bangalore. Would love to visit again."
1.0,Considering a 4.2 review expected a lot from this place.  Ambience was 5/5  Coming food it was not satisfactory. Felt it to be tasteless and over priced. Not many options for vegetarian in starters.  Food & Service 2/5
3.0,Ok Ok Food.....and waiters were bit impolite.....starters were fine but food was disappointing. As service charges are always optional ...we actually refused to pay the service charges and next minute waiter asked me we will not provide you service then from next time..
3.0,"Food was fantastic. We took the buffet and it was super tasty and authentic. Number of items are lesser than waht you get from the likes of ABs etc but then they make up with taste and freshness. The best butter chicken you can get in Bangalore. Mutton dishes need to be improved. But one thing which can land them in trouble and leaves a bad taste is the service....pathetic. For every request as small as a roti basket....you have to wait for 10-15 min, stand up and try to seek the attention of the server. Call him.....repeat and then may be they will deliver. This when the restaurant was half full. The server did come to introduce himself at the beginning but then that is the end of courtesy. Dear owner.... I loved your food...dont want to see you closed. Please bring up your service or I will loose the only place I get authentic butter chicken."
3.0,"After doing a couple of research of restaurants in Marathahalli..decided to finally try this restaurant for a sunday lunch with family... The ambience of the restautant is decent, pretty much the similar standards we see any Punjabi restaurant. The staff were extremly friendly and courteous. Now coming to the food..we had ordered dhaba paneer tikka and a starter based out of soya..both the starters were decent..wont really say mindblowing.. For main course try the Baigan Bharta and Dhabe di roti which was really good and even the CHAS we ordered was really nice... Pricing is slightly on the higer side..landed up paying 2.5k fr 3 people (veg cuisine). Overall a good decent restaurant to try ..but not sure if you will pay a visit again.  My ratings: Food : 3/5 Staff : 4/5 Ambience: 3.5/5"
4.0,"This is a Punjabi dhaba themed restaurant with colorful and very well decorated interior. It serves one of the best north Indian food. We had achari soya chap and paneer tikka for starters, and paneer makhan masala for main course, both of which were made with soft and fresh paneer. Although the quantity served was good, the price charged for all the menu items is on a higher side. I found the music a bit too loud to have a comfortable conversation."
5.0,"The place is really good. Nice ambience and tasty food. We loved the mutton, cooked to perfection! Service was nice too and friendly people. Everyone should try here, we will be definitely coming back."
1.0,I went to this place because it was with good rating but dont know on what basis it is that highly rated.. Higly overrated... Too expensive.. Low quality food.. Delay in service.. Not at recommended...
4.0,"The food and service quality is definitely 5-star worthy. But it's ridiculously expensive. Can't ""digest"" the fact that a simple chaas (buttermilk) was 200 bucks! Should've checked the cost of the items on other restaurant review apps. That said, both veg and non-veg items were delicious. It could be a regular dining option if they make it a little cheaper. Otherwise you're not going to see me there unless my office is paying the bill!"
4.0,Very nice place to take the kids along for a dine out. Every Friday it has a live DJ that really makes for a fun evening . Food quality and service was very good. Loved it
5.0,Was looking for a good North Indian restaurant in the near by localities that has zomato gold is when I came across this place. This place is located at the main ring road at the 6th floor . They have managed to give it a dhaba theme. Amazing ambience. We ordered tandoori chicken in the starters and 2 chicken gravies handi chicken and chicken patiala. All the chicken dishes were to die for. Amazing mouth watering taste with the perfect blend of spices. After a very long had this authentic Punjabi taste.  The veg pulo was great as well. The prices are slightly at the high end but the taste compansates for it. Must try!!
1.0,We asked about removing service charge since it is optional to pay now by government rule. But they charged 10% while arguing that they can not remove it. After explaining them for a good 15 minutes they still refuse to remove the optional service charge. At no other place did I have to argue about removing service charge. And their menu mentions nothing about it. And it's legally required to write the same on the menu. Food was good but this is just ignorance of the law on the restaurants part
5.0,"Visited here for dinner last night. And we liked everything about this place. the ambiance is so colorful and staff is so lovely. It was a birthday party, so the crew celebrated and danced for us. In food, all their non veg options are yummy and delicious. Their lassis are whole another level. and a must try."
3.0,"Ambience and sitting area/capacity is excellent, staffs are polite and quick to take request. Service is good but why should I pay 10% extra service charge? It should not be made mandatory, I would rather love to tip for service given. Anyways, coming to the food items i ordered. Jaljeera and mawa lassi was disappointing and overpriced. I mean, who charges 249 bucks for Jaljeera?? I didn't see the price and ordered, my mistake. Mutton tak a tak and Bhatti di tangdi was tasty and should be tried if you are visiting. Dal makhani is again overpriced and ghee overpowered the dal making the dish very heavy. Paneer Makhan wala was tasty and quantity is sufficient for 2 serving. Butter Chicken curry was very spicy, I have had much better chicken curry elsewhere. Overall the experience was not as delightful as i would have liked."
5.0,"This is the most authentic north Indian Food I ever had in Bangalore. Chicken actually tasted like it was cooked by my mom. I had handi chicken, makki di roti, sarso da saag. Also the staff gave an epic dance performance."
4.0,"This place is a little difficult to find, situated at third floor of the building. It has got rustic feels, decor is of a typical North Indian dhaba. I have heard a good deal about the food served here and it really matched up to the expectation.  We ordered soya chaap and mutton galouti kabab for starters. Loved both of these dishes. For main course, we ordered butter chicken, paneer butter masala, cheese tomato garlic naan, Missi roti, lacha parantha and tandoori roti. All these dishes were yummilicious. A major plus point is that they have zomato gold on food here. Highly recommend this place to go with your group and binge on the North Indian food here.  Food - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Service - 4/5"
4.0,"Amazing food and also the ambience is good. Tried both non veg and veg dishes , its good. If you are punjabi food lover then you should definitely visit this place"
1.0,The place did not turn out to be as good as expected. Food is very costly but not such good in taste. I was not happy with either the ambiance or the food taste.
4.0,Food is awesome tasty and there is no such comments for the improvement. The only thing is the price is little bit higher than other. Device and hotel atticates are also nice. Totally authentic Punjabi style restaurant.
5.0,Dhaba never disappoints. The galauti Kababs are good! Great place for North Indian food. Vegetarian will love this place plethora of options.
4.0,"Food is for eating, and good food is to be enjoyed. Must try if you are looking for North Indian cuisines. Mutton curry and Paneer Tikka was the best from my order list. Recommend you to try also. Also tried Fish fry and Chicken masala and it was okay. Doorstep delivery was on time."
1.0,"Highly overrated , food not at all worthy of price . Very disappointed with taste of food. Thanks to Zomato gold for saving for money. Service was satisfactory ."
4.0,"I visited this place with my team. The experience was okay not great. Price is high. If u order any curry, it will be around Rs.329 and butter naan/kulcha is Rs. 69 + tax , pan : 89 + tax so you can imagine . Please do not order chicken chilli. It was not good at all. Drinks are over priced with respect to the place. Please keep one thing in mind before asking for bill - service charge. Please ask to remove it before bill is generated because they will argue like hell once bill is generated. Jitna accha mood khana kha ke hua h voh sab bekar kar denge voh log!!! Food: 4 star ,Behaviour: 3 Star, Price : 3 Star , Ambiance: 4 star. Hope this help. Happy Eating!!"
5.0,"It's located in Marathahalli outer ring road above @home, Nice ambiance and food was amazing, if you like spice that could be great, this is my second visit place, I love there lunch buffet, all the desert are superb test. definitely I will come back soon."
5.0,"We ordered Kala sa Kala chicken,sarsoon da saag, makai Roti n lassi.The amount was good enough for 3 to 4 people.That chicken they brought in a coal iron which people used in 80s for pressing clothes nd the chicken was extremely juicy. They served sarsoon ka saag along with gur and white butter.@ last tried their Lassi it was very thick but not malaidar . So I would request you to improve the quality of Lassi. Overall it was a wonderful experience and become 1of my fav in Bangalore."
5.0,Service authentic punjabi taste with Bollywood music. Enjoyed the food a lot... Must try dal dhaba kala sha kala kukkad along with that we had dhaba roti kulcha Is the best restaurant in Bangalore the staff is also very polite and attentive.... Overall awesome
1.0,"The taste of food is good but the service is bad. Really bad. Actually they won't serve you at all if the restaurant is full. I have doubts on the hygiene of the place. My water was refilled twice (after spotting and complaining about dirty water) but both times it had foreign particles. I can only imagine how my food would have been cooked. The food won't arrive as per your request. It would arrive at the whim of the waiter. As he would only visit you once(to get your order to table ) , so there won't be anyone around to even complain. As he arrives on table, you would ask him to serve, he would depart making some excuse without ever returning. So now it is upto you even you want to eat. If you do, then suit yourself. Very poorly managed. And amazing thing is they would take service charge from you. I wonder for what! If you are one who looks for service for experience, this is not the place definitely. If you only care for taste, the taste of food is good. Definitely not the place for refined date experience nor the place where you would want to take your parents. Ok for boys night out in case you plan to drink heavy and eat, cos frankly then you don't care for service as much. Never going back."
3.0,"Great food and ambience.It was pretty crowded and buzzing.The place actually gives you a feeling that you're eating at a highway dhaba. The staff members are very polite and dearly try to address your ask.We had Chicked tak tak, bhatinda chicken curry with butter nan,roti&parathas. Starters was not that much great.But, gravy along with rotis were delicious. Bhatinda chicken curry was extra-ordinary. Best deal for food along with zomato gold."
5.0,"The ambience of this place is amazing. Great service, the staff even performed to entertain us. The food tasted amazing,little pricey but with the gold privilege it's worth it."
2.0,Bad experience. Service was slow. Per the high price I would rate the food as just nearing to average and nothing really great. One glass of beverage is above Rs. 250 and it didnt taste anything great than a normal fruit milk shake which should not be more than 100 bucks. I think the management has kept the price super high very over confidently.
4.0,"Visited the place for dinner with a friend. We'd reached quite early in the evening and could find a table immediately. The staff is very polite, attended to us promptly, the food was served quickly. We ordered Veg Galouti, Dal Dhabha, Subz Patiala, Naan, and Jeera Rice. The food overall was well made and tasty, specially the daal and galouti kebab, they were brilliant! Do not miss on those two items when you visit the place. The lassi was lip smacking as well. The ambience is quite colourful and quirky and matches up to the name and theme of the place- Dhaba! I would rate the place 5 stars. However, I've rated it 4 for not finding any shorba (soup) selection on the menu! I could see people on few other tables too inquiring if they served shorbas. I would love if they extended their menu to include some soup offerings. Overall, it's an amazing place to grab authentic North Indian dhaba food in Bangalore."
5.0,Excellent food specially the non veg and very friendly staff. Great service provided by Vikram. A must visit place in Bangalore. I gained 2 KGs after visiting AB's.
5.0,"This place has been there in Indirangar for quite long, recently they have opened a branch in Marathahalli area. The food is excellent i must say and so is their hospitality. Awesome service. Mutton takatak and lassi deserves a special mention here. We took back to back lassis and skipped the desert this time. Portion wise the dishes are good for 2-3. Planning to come back again to try other things here. P.s. the staffs gave a complimentary desert to us :P"
3.0,"Waited for too long, food was also not that good, South indians will not prefer here, there are lot of other options, not sure why this rated more, however polite staff"
5.0,"Bijoy, you are a rockstar. Fantastic service and even better performance on the dance floor.  I was pleasantly surprised by the staff making their way to the dance floor and making sure we had a good time. Would love to visit again.  I'm glad that Dhaba captured the essence of the food and feel that we get in Punjab and Delhi, and I will surely recommend it to any Bangalorean who wants to have a taste of Punjab without leaving Bangalore."
4.0,Good one! Authentic Punjabi food Good for both vegetarians and Non vegetarians. Nice ambiance with a bar inside.Would suggest this place as worth visiting.
4.0,"Typical dhaba place - colourful, desi styled ambience, delicious food topped with some Punjabi music!  It's pretty expensive for what it offers. I guess it all goes in for the Dhaba brand.  We ate a lot of dishes - murg tangdi, mutton galouti kebab, fish fry, mutton gravy, and dhaba di Roti and dal khichdi. Giving 4 because the fish did not seem very fresh.  All the dishes were good, especially the Dhabe di Roti. It contains egg and it's very soft in comparison to any other bread they have on the menu.  All the waiters danced to some of their favourite numbers at least once a day and we got lucky today. It was very entertaining. Our staff was ever smiling whenever he spoke to us. The manager was also clearing up tables for the guests.  Overall the experience was a very good one and would definitely visit again and try out the vegetarian dishes."
4.0,The place is very well themed and the food is delicious the menu the theka all are well thought only thing is its slightly on expensive side and even a coke costs 150 bucks. But otherwise the service and fopd quality makes up for it
4.0,"I have ordered home delivery from Dhaba86 and we really liked the taste of their food. This time went for a dine in on a Sunday evening. The restaurant ambience is set up well with lots of Punjab village life inspired motifs. The food was tasty but the servings size was small. Overall, the service and food was good and I'll not hesitate to recommend and try again for good North Indian food in a city like Bengaluru."
4.0,"Good ambience, music. North indian food is amazing here. I ordered makke di roti, sarso da saag, garlic naan, butter naan, chicken malai tikka, badam halwa. All were amazing. Naan had some uncooked portions but excused it for the lovely sarso da saag and badam halwa.  On top of that, the moment the dj arrived, all employees started dancing, taking the energy one notch higher."
4.0,Food was quite good. We ordered Dhaba style paneer tikka. Taste wise bang on! Slightly expensive though compared to the basic butter chicken and Naan that they are serving.
5.0,Serves authentic punjabi taste with bollywood music... enjoyed the food a lot...Must try tandoori aalo and Paneer taka tak.. along with that we had garlic naan and kulcha with baigan khatta mitha.. Lassi is the best Bangalore.. In desert you can try rabri.. The staff is also very polite and attentive.. Overall awesome experience with Dhaba...
5.0,"Serves authentic punjabi taste with bollywood music..Had Tandoori aalo, Paneer taka tak, baigan khatta mitha with Garlic naan and amritsari kulcha... Lassi is the best in Bangalore.. In desert you can try rabri and gulaab jamun."
5.0,"I ll say , place were you can sit and chill for hours having some good drinks or if u want the desi lassi and another think which makes it more happening is that you can enjoy all the flavours in you mouth from north india with a huge variety on your menu card."
3.0,"I liked their signature Dal Dhaba, goes very well with breads and rice alike. Chicken butter masala was excessively creamy. The management should consider having more staff on the floor if a la carte is what they want to be known for. Definitely come here for the Dal Dhaba."
5.0,Enjoyed the buffet it has too much of variety and the starters was very tasty and good we liked more the paner kuchan also the dal was the best part service was humble and quite
5.0,Classically designed restaurant to give you that authentic punjabi dhaba feel. Amazing food and presentation. Tandoori bhune aloo is a must must try!!
4.0,"Wanna Punjabi Food, this is the place. Ambience matches the name. Lassi is a must try. Food quality is good, they levy 10% service charge in addition."
4.0,"Ambiance: Awesome Taste: 1. Roti and curries are very delicious (Particularly Paneer items) 2. Don't try biryani. Chicken Biryani was more like a Pulav and not a good taste. They give so many pieces and very less rice. We ended up wasting so many pieces, as pieces alone were difficult to eat Cost: Expensive  Good thing was they have Zomato Gold."
3.0,"I dont find this place worthy of a 4.4 at all.the ambience is nice,they have given that desi tadka look,but as per the reviews and the ratings for the food it wasnt great at all. The naan wasnt properly cooked and on complaining the waiter said its per our standards,we got the naan changed teice coz it wasnt cooked properly.gravy was good,but really not worth according to the prices and the service."
5.0,Loved with food and ambiance. Service was really nice. This platter was so tasty and yummy.  Specially the music you played whiling having food was forced me to dance
5.0,"We ordered handi chicken and patiyala mixed veg with naan. And In the dessert we ordered ras malai and gajar halwa. We liked everything, there was no excess oil and the food was not very spicy. Also, the dessert was not loaded with sugar and ghee. I would definitely come back here."
3.0,"Food is a bit overpriced and quantity is less. We ordered Non veg platter, chicken was delicious, mutton and fish were average. Ambience was good."
3.0,"Good place for a north indian food. But very spicy starter( paneer taka tak). And the kadhai paneer was not at all spicy. I don't know where it went wrong but was not satisfied with the food. Sweet lassi was excellent though. Good environment , ambience as well as service. No problem with that."
4.0,"The food quality is very good and there are lot of varieties to choose from. Non-veg platter was perfect start alongwith oreo choco shake. For the main course, we were focussed on the kadhai chicken, butter chicken, paneer butter masala and dal makhani. We can very feel the taste of the spices and the black pepper. Bijoy has taken great care of us while we were sitting calmly and having food. The staff has been very polite and friendly.  Looking forward to visit again soon!"
3.0,"A nice restraunt with overly priced menu.  Nice food with slow service .May be following tortoise story theme, slow n steady win the race  #JustOneTimeVisitRestraunt"
4.0,"Visited this place on Saturday night. Here is how I would like to rate this restaurant Ambience - 4 Food - 4 ( Though the food is ok, but seems like excessive oil has been in few of the dishes) Service - 3.5 (Though the restaurant was not full, and waiter introduced himself before taking the order, most of the time he was not available when we wanted to order) Price was relatively high with respect to quality of food and service. Recommendation - There are not many places in Bangalore that serve good North Indian Dhaba food, so this place is worth a visit, at least once."
5.0,"Amazing place to have North Indian food. Have been here 3-4 times and never disappointed.  We were served by bijoy who is always very polite and hospitable, cheerful and smiling.."
5.0,The staff was very friendly. Service was pretty fast. Specially our host Vijay was great and very Frank .He also helped understand the best dishes. #punjabifood #
5.0,Awesome food and service is also great.! Staff is very nice . Ambience is also good. Must visit place and should try dal tadka. Bijoy is very friendly and helpful.
5.0,"Everything in this restaurant is exceptional. The decor, food, service, drinks and specially the Baba with the goggles painting I guess credo goes to the painter for such a wonderful painting. Bimla our server was so helpful in suggesting the fine dishes from the menu."
5.0,A place well located on ORR Marathalli. Best in terms of authentic North Indian cuisine. Dal Makhni and Balti Mutton is to die for. I guess they have the best Dal Makhni in whole Bangalore. Service is attentive and quick.
3.0,The place is located near to more megastore marathalli.  Vallet parking is available here.  It's located in 3rd floor.  The service is not that fast. They are not clear what to serve when  Starters are not that great..Main course is fine..Pan quality is not good should improve  Overall service needs to be fast and some items needs attention also...  No where near to AB's or BBQ Nation
4.0,"This place totally satisfies the Punjabi in me. As the name suggest, dhaba is themed as a dhaba. I have had a la carte as well as buffet here. For buffet, the menu is pretty standard with a couple of starters and a good main course. Highlight is the live counter. For a la carte I have tried their butter chicken and dal dhaba with butter naan. They serve it with sirke wale pyaaz. The food is really tasty and i am glad they have opened up such a good north indian option in Marathahalli, amidst all the biryani places around! This place is paisa vasool and a must visit for those who are missing northie guilty pleasure food and even for those who want to explore the food of northern India. I rest my case."
5.0,"As soon as you enter the restaurant you start admiring the ambiance. It looks and feels authentic dhaba.  Food is awesome, service is great, drinks are good, love desi music and staff dance!  Kudos to the management.  Have a great time..  Cheers!"
4.0,"Awesome buffet experience!!! Everything in their menu was so good and yummy, after long time I had great North Indian food. Service is good too. Total win-win!!"
4.0,"Ambience was Good. Staff was polite and courteous. We ordered Chef's Special : Sarso ka Saag and Makke ki Roti both tasted good, but still was missing that special feel. I have eaten better of the above items here in Bangalore. Dhaba dal was average hence deducted 1 star."
5.0,"On my last visit to Bangalore got chance to visit Dhaba. And it turned out as a good to have food their. Loved the ambience , decor and food. The best past is the service. Hatts off for their service. Thanks Sanjay to make my day. Will visit soon"
4.0,"A bit on the costlier side which might make you feel sometimes that you could have eaten more for the amount you are spending. Coming to the taste, it was really good. We loved their dal makhani. Do try one of their signature dish Chicken ""Kala Sha Kala"" because trust me, the edible charcoal makes it heavenly ;)"
5.0,"What a wonderful place it is!! What you need on a brunch.. Good food.. Drinks.. Desserts.. Entertainment.. Good service.. . . . .so on..  On top of all good stuff, what if when you get a service from BIJOY!! He is such a polite, calm, soft spoken genetlmen and he serves the food and treat the gueat like his guest.  Thank you."
5.0,Love the starters here. Especially Mutton and fish. Friendly environment. Not a fan of main course here. Best for team celebrations during lunch buffet.
5.0,Polite and friendly staff. 5 star service by Bishnu. Good quality food and nice ambiance. Good place for family and friends gathering. Had a great time.
5.0,Great place for exotic North Indian food in Bengaluru. My first visit and absolutely loved it. Would recommend to every food enthusiast out there.
5.0,One of the best places for extoic north indian cuisine in Bangalore. Have been here twice and loved it. It's gets better in every visit. The kala Sha kala chicken tikka was out of this world.
5.0,"Hey... So I have been wanting to go this place for a very long time... I had heard so much about this place from my friends all the way from Delhi. To my relief it definitely did live up to its hype... The food was just splendid... I had gone there with my wife and parents... We ordered for the brilliantly made balti meat. The mutton so tender that it was literally breaking down with 3 fingers... *Delicious* we also had butter chicken, bhai Dilli yaad aayi gayi!!!!"
5.0,"Lovely place to enjoy with the fantastic drink ZALIMA & ANARKALI. Really liked their drink name. Food is also met on exceed expectations.  I have tried their services in Delhi, a official tour and I searched this place great time at Bangalore too."
5.0,"The ambience itself here is so welcoming that you feel at ease. We were a group of six We ordered Dal Makhni and some more dishes,the Dal which they are serving I should say the best ever dal I have ever had. If you are a lover of north Indian food,i would strongly recommend to try out this place. Thank you Dhaba team for the wonderful food and service.Will be visiting again soon with all my friends and family."
5.0,"Amazing food amazing service .highlight of the restaurant when the staff dances for some amazing bollywood numbers.  A must visit place at Marathahalli,just located below FoxTrot Marathahalli"
5.0,This place is real good. The staff was very courteous. The food was excellent. The entire ambience was so special. Must visit place for foodies.
5.0,Unplanned visit turned into my favourite place. Best place for group get together and wonderful place to visit specially for birthdays they will help u to celebrate the occasion. Will definitely visit again and recommend to my freinds.  Cheers Team
5.0,The place always stands on the height it is on. For the last three times ASIT has been my guy. He knows what I want to order and always been in the exact nature he is when I met him the first day. So its a great experience every time.
3.0,Prices are too high for the taste and quantity they offered!!! One example I can give is that I had never seen the price of one small glass of lassi to be 250 approx
5.0,"Location-5 Ambience-5 Food-5 Service-5 Staff-5  This Pind style Dhaba is located at the 3rd floor next to Raddisson Blu. The ambience depicts the theme of a Bollywood style Punjabi dhaba. The place is lively and the walls are covered with Bollywood pun's.  We ordered 3 dishes: 1.) Dhaba Paneer Tikka- It was mildly spicy, juicy, light and slightly smoky. A great choice for appetizer. 2.) Amritsari Chole-The taste is similar to the chole one gets in the punjabi joints on the streets of delhi. 3.) Butter chicken 1986- The gravy was creamy and the chicken was tender and juicy.  For breads, I would suggest one should try Missi roti.  The staff really tries to build a personal connection with the guests. Each table was assigned to a specific individual who looks after the guests. I was even offered a shikanji when I was waiting for my friends.  Overall a must visit place if you are craving for authentic Dhaba style Punjabi food."
5.0,"Visited this restaurant for the 2nd time last Sunday as of course my 1st experience was extremely well. This time went with my family and we were overwhelmed with the service that they provided. I am generally not someone who prefer Indian Cuisine and dine often in Indian restaurants, but this one is a thumbs up for me. Starting from the dance entertainment till providing complimentary dessert items till gifting my little one balloons :-), our lunch experience went really well this time as well. It is worth mentioning of Binoy (I hope I am naming the correct person, a bengali waiter) and Asit, who did not fail to serve us to our satisfaction. Would visit here again for sure!"
5.0,The place has a good ambience and food is outstanding. I had been there for an occasion and I didnt feel disappointed. I would recommend this place if they require good food around Marathahalli.
1.0,Food is not at all good .No way near to punjabi food. Only dal makhni was ok ok rest were really bad. Platters are the worst.andd service was also vey slow they brought our food after 45 min
5.0,"Had some good dhaba food after quite some time.  Located right in the line of so many other multi cuisine restaurants, this place is a stealer if you want proper punjabi-haryanvi style food. The staff members are very polite and dearly try to address your ask. The buffet here is just perfect for a tummy filling relish:) Ambiance wise, do not miss out on paying a visit to their wrestling history and collection room..."
5.0,"Delicious Food, amazing service and great hospitality !!!! Keep it up guys !!!! The ambience is exceptional. Balti meat what is their signature mutton dish is mouth watering and superbly delicious. Will definitely recommend others to visit.."
5.0,Had fun on a Friday Night with colleagues. Food was delicious. Loved the ambience of the restaurant. Service was top notch special shout out to Bimla and Bijoy for a wonderful service. Would definitely love to visit with family again.
4.0,"We were two people looking for authentic North Indian cuisine on a Sunday afternoon and after considering other options in and around Marathahalli, we zeroed in on this place.  Ambience - 4/5  It's a proper family restaurant, hence it was pretty crowded and buzzing. The place actually gives you a feeling that you're eating at a highway dhaba.  Food - 4/5  For starters, we had something to do with potatoes, which was exactly how I'd want potatoes to be, spicy and crispy. Unlike most other places, their starters had good quantity.  For main course, we went for the breads and for main course, we had their bhindi masala which was hands down my pick from there. It was really well made that we actually wanted to order extra rotis just to have the bhindi. It was AMAZING. We also had their veg biryani which was a little bland for my liking and finally we wrapped the meal up with their jamun :)  Overall - 4/5  I'd come back here just to try the bhindi again :)"
5.0,"Bishnu was the awesome host to us, And the food was awesome and the kala Sha kaala kukkad was the best and the fav from now the ambience was the best part and you guys where awesome in all the things  Thankyou and keep it up"
5.0,Amazing ambience with truly delicious dishes served. Loved the mushroom starter.. Great hospitality shown by Vishnu :) will be back here soon!
5.0,Really great place for food. Do ask for recommendations and the servers are really great and could make your visit worthwhile by suggesting best dishes as per your taste preferences.
3.0,"The place is locate in ORR and is easy to reach the location in google maps is a bit off, so be careful.  Had been here twice and both times the last experience have been completely opposite, first time we liked it so much that next time we decided to eat north Indian decided to go here only but this time we regretted it.  These are the dishes we tried :  - Kadai paneer : this was very good, the paneer was soft and had the right balance of vegetables and paneer  - Dal makhani : tried this both time and both times we were very satisfied with it, was rich in taste but not sweet  - Paneer taka tak : this is a starter had a slight Chinese flavor to it but was nice  - Dhabe chicken : this was just like homemade chicken with lots of ghee in it, the chicken was soft and tasted very nice  - Paneer makhani : this is suggested to us by the waiter, but we didn't liked it as the gravy was very odd, it wasn't a flowing gravy but with small onion and tomato pieces all over the gravy  - Handi chicken : this was another things suggested by waiter, and we didn't liked this also, this also didn't had a gravy but had full pieces of garlic and big pieces of onion and tomato, because of this the taste of gravy never mixed with chicken with was very odd.  - Lassi : it was good, thick and tasty but 230 odd ruppes for a Lassi is too much  Want to give one more try to this place, as one experience of ours was very good.  Food : 3/5 Ambience : 3/5 Service : 4/5 VFM : 3.5/5"
4.0,The place is good with nice ambience and nice food. The food is tasty n good. The food tastes almost like it was made in punjab. Only thing i dint like was the chitta butter chicken it is too bland n in white gravy.
1.0,"Not much varieties on main course, veg starters were full of paneers, deserts were not a good as expected. overall service is poor and not worth for money"
4.0,Nice ambiance and food no doubt is very tasty.. you will feel proud by seeing all Pehelwans pictures..  Quality and quantity of the foods are also good..  We ordered chefs special charcoal chicken & chicken wings (starter). Then lachha paratha with handi chicken and chicken do payaza (main course). I felt handi chicken can be lill more spicy then it would have perfect.
5.0,The place has a very nice vibe. Please try balti meat if you are a mutton lover. The service and staff are very nice. Good place to celebrate an occasion
5.0,Biggest Restaurant out of all their chains. The best in taste always. I am a regular foodie and try to bring my friends and loved ones whenever possible. Keep up the awesome service and hospitality guys. Cheers!
3.0,Didn't like the food. Over priced. Zomato gold was applied but they are not much aware about it. Non veg dish like chicken butter masala was too weird. Can work on the food quality
4.0,"Good hospitality, good food, quick service, but slightly high prices. Tried veg food only, so not so sure about the nonveg . Can be a one time visit."
4.0,Great food and ambience. Palak paneer seekh is not good. Mawa Lassi is ok fry fruits quantity was less Makki ki roti and sarson ka saga is great. Paneer taka tak is also good. Mushroom hara bhara pyaz is not tasty. Avoid
1.0,Food is very expensive specially buttermilk and lassi are charged at 230rs per glass. Take long time to serve the food after the order is taken. Not value to money.. taste is not as good as any other dhaba style restaurant.. specially non-veg is not tasty at all.
4.0,Really enjoyed the food at Dhaba . In starters we liked the Paneer tikka . In main course we relished the winter food : Sarsoda Sag and Makke ki roti . Will definitely recommend it for a sumptuous North Indian dinner
3.0,Vibrant place with good interior. Good for group lunches. Quantity is average and taste is ok. The service is great. Parking is not available but you can park in the nearby restaurant parking zones.
5.0,"True to its name the place is reminiscent of an authentic punjabi dhaba and it reflects in the food being offered too. The colourful walls with desi decals, steel n copper cutleries, decorated love counters and a bar that reminds you of lassi shops with all those glass bottles kept in line for decoration.  We ordered amritsari kukkad, mutton taka tak, daal, balti mutton,bhaigan ka bharta, dhaba style dal makhni and some nans. Oh yes, a generous serving of Rasmalai in the dessert.  Out of all the items that we ordered it was the mutton taka tak that we found the yummiest of all. So much so we almost ended up ordering one more. The mutton chunks were soft, juicy along with masala made of tomatoes, onions and green chilies was simply delicious. So was the amritsari kukkad. Succulent chicken pieces marinated with curd and smoked with ginger and garlic flavor were too good to resist.  We would definitely recommend this place to everyone who wants to experience Indian dhaba culture with a modern twist and taste some lip smacking dhaba cuisines."
4.0,"Good north Indian food. Dal makhani is amazing. Soya chaap, which is rare to find in Bangalore, is good too. Malai Kofta was really beyond expectations as it was not on the sweet side."
3.0,Mediocre food. Good atmosphere. This is a veg only experience. The menu was limited with no shorba / soup types at all. And it's a bit pricey too. A sweet lassi would cost you 220 + bucks.. yes you read it really right. I was quite astonished at this price totally.. and it was nothing so special too.  Infact nothing that we ordered were so good that would bring you back. Only the lively karaoke was the highlight of the night. Nothing else. Sorry!
4.0,"Food is for eating, and good food is to be enjoyed. Delicious food With North Indian taste. Mutton curry and Paneer Tikka was the best. Recommend you to try also. Also tried Fish fry and Chicken masala and it was okay. Doorstep delivery was on time."
5.0,"Starting from Ambience through appetizers|main course|beverages and right till the desserts, this place serves unmatchable North Indian flavours and delicacies. While the regular dishes - Dal Makhni, Butter Chicken etc. is anyway outstanding, Dhaba has launched an extraordinary winter menu called  Pind Diyan Gallan.  Recommended Appetizers -  Tandoori Fal-Fruit( a very creative fruit delicacy and a must try even for non vegetarians) and Kala Sha Kala Kukkad.   Must try Main Course - Sarson Da Saag ( finger licking food with makki di roti and white butter)  Methi Mutter Malai(vegetarian prep taken to another level)  Burni Murgh ( for chicken lovers- well cooked and tastily spiced)   Must try desserts-  Gulkand kheer( a very elegant preparation with optimum sugar and rose quantity)  Khubaani da meetha (a chewy and tangy apricot preparation with vanilla ice cream)    Must try drinks Gulaabo(cocktail with a kala khatta twist)  Ganna Sa Ras (sugar cane lovers, dont miss out)  Aam Panna (sweet, tangy and mangoish )   To top it all, we happened to be there at a karaoke night, post which the staff demonstrated a fantastic dance performance on some trending Punjabi tracks."

5.0,"After a rain-filled adventurous ride to the restuarant.. walking in drenched and getting directed to the less cold corner of the restaurant was a treat. Appreciate the prompt gesture from the manager.  Special call out to Bijoy for making the rest of the evening pleasant, with his prompt response and availablity at our table. The food he suggested were all good too.  We had a tandoor aloo, paneer tak-a-tak, veg biryani and the handi kulfi. All of which I would rate 4 on 5. Good food. Good service. Good ambience. Priced slightly on the higher side but nothing a Zomato gold subscription can't take care of.  Overall a nice experience and would definitely recommend."
5.0,Most vibrant voracious sparkling and scintillatingly cool dhaba. Asif was especially courteous in serving us. Definitely recommend it for punjabis
5.0,First time when me n my husband went there was some issue with the billing system. They asked us very politely to come next time. Second time we got lucky and had a gala time here :) Plus they have zomato gold 1+1 on food..... Jaada kuch nai bolna bas gharke khaane ki yaad dila di aapne!!!
5.0,"Awesome food with a cordial staff :) must visit for North Indians. A la carte menu is nice with a buffet option as well...........,. Recommend this place"
5.0,The food here is truly awesome...Authentic Punjabi food that I've ever tasted in Bangalore. Service is top notch especially by one Mr. Bijoy and his team. They make you feel cosy and at home. Kudos to the team. Must try are Dhaba Paneer starter and Amritsari Chole.
4.0,Very friendly and polite staff. Amazing and fast service. We ordered sarso da saag and makke di roti in main course which was really delicious.
1.0,Service was pathetic even when the crowd was less. They took more than 30 mins to bring the main course when it was ordered almost with the starter. It's really embarrassing sitting with your family and waiting for so long. Please don't try this outlet atleast.
4.0,The food was delicious..we have ordered paneen tiktak in starter and paneer makhni with Amritsar kulcha n butter naan in main course...overall food was good except parking facility. Must try pan virgin mojito and dry fruit lassi...e
1.0,Very high priced and Worst food. service and theme was awesome . Shouldn't try fish and paneer item here.. fish is smelly and paneer taste is like pickle. Not worthy at all
4.0,Rest was fine just the chicken handi was not not good. Expectng something better!  Chole especially .. were totally awesome.  And lassi tooo.
1.0,"I have gone to this resturant after see the rating on zamato, i have ordered paneer tika which is good but i canot described the main course it is really disgusting, i have ordered paneer makhni it is the worst pneer i have ever had and then i order dal tadka ,it looked like they just boiled the dal and given"
3.0,"Been here twice . The ambience is amazing but the food is average . I have tasted its paneer Tikka , tandoor tangdi starter and butter chicken .  Price : on the high end Taste : average Quantity as per price : good for main course , less for starters Ambience : good , dj plays nice songs"
3.0,"Order: Handi Chicken and lachha Pranitha  Taste:3.5/5 (too oily) Menu:3/5 no options of thali. Curry and bread costs a lot. Restaurant didn't have any combo/thali option for online delivery Packaging: 4.5/5  Value for money: 3/5. The food is nice if you take out the top layer of butter/oil but still is not worth the money. Many other restaurants provide tastier food at lesser price.  Would I order again?  sorry. Pls come up with thali/combo options so that we can try some more dishes and if they are irresistible, will order again."
4.0,"followed by    Ambience: (3/5) Good interiors, not quite exactly like a Dhaba setup. You get a good feel of a dhaba though because of Punjabi songs playing in the background and the food.  Service: (5/5) Exceptional! The guys are very polite and helpful for special requests and quick in terms of turn around times.  Food: (4/5) Great food! We ordered Soya chaap achari and Paneer Tikka for starters. Both tasted awesome, but they could have made soya chaap more achaari. Ordered Amritsari Chole and Pindi Daal Tadka for mains with Garlic naan and Tandoori Roti. Chole tasted very authentic and was delicious. So was daal!    - It is slightly expensive. One glass of Buttermilk costs  about INR200 but was tasty! - None other that I can think of for now.  Will visit again!"
4.0,Visited with one of my friend. Got a place which can actually lift up your mood. We ordered handi murg and Nice food full on punjabi style.Friendly staffs and great music. Must visit if you wanna have north indian food with loud music...

5.0,"Great food and the selection of drinks is a must try. Once the music starts pumping in, you get to enjoy the ambience even more. The staff is verf courteous and make sure that you are engaged when needed."
3.0,"Service was Good and quick, Food quality was ok, Beverages were ok, Breads: good, Platters should have some more variety, A little Overpriced"
4.0,Had been planning to go here since long and finally made it through a team outing. The place is Punjabi themed with colourful and witty captions around. You get a bante ki bottle as welcome drink.  Starters - Non veg starters were quite tasty but the veg ones were a little sweet for our liking. Main course - Tried a little bit of few items and couldnt find a flaw. There was lesser variety though which didnt do justice to the price. Desserts - Jalebis were amazing and so were gulab jamuns. Service was a little slow at start but a nice place to visit.
2.0,"Okay, ambience wise, the place lives up to its name. The staff is also very polite. Food was okay, but the quantity for that price was too less. The chicken Biryani which I ordered, has room for improvement."
5.0,Asit has served very well. He has arranged cake in very minimal time & suggested all the great dishes! Overall good visit. Nice staff. & all the staff are good dancers.
5.0,"Amazing food, great staff and awesome ambience. A kind request for not having the karaoke evening its to loud and makes the whole experience go for a toss. Thank you Bijoy and Bishnu for the amazing service."

3.0,Ambience is really good. Prices are on the higher side. Taste is just fine. Service was really good. Should bring new varieties. Its a one time go.
5.0,Great food !! Amazing staff specially Gaurav who took good care of us. The place also serves alcohol  and perfect place to dine and wine. Try their authentic kebabs and crispy butter breads and it will make you nostalgic if you are a North Indian.
4.0,Food is good and the staffs are humble and polite. Nice ambience.. But the price is bit heavy.. Never order for a water bottle they charge 110 for a bottle.. Go for regular water.. And zomato gold is great.. Love zomato..
3.0,Location on top floor on outer ring road marathalli.The place is based on dhaba type.But u really dnt that vibe as seatings are madern based.Coming to food.I tried their lassi which was ok ok.Kadai paneer which was pretty fresh n spicy n semi gravy.Their tawa gravy sabzi.Both were ok ok nothing which stands out.May b a one time visit.Use zomato gold prices will mke ur visit worthwhile.
4.0,"Makes u feel that u r sitting in a typical punjabi restaurant  Ambience is simple n sober One very minute problem which I personally felt was by the name of the dishes u cannot guess whether it is a starter or main course, the names r such Prawns n chilly chicken is a must try Overall a good place"
5.0,"This was my 3rd time visit to dhabha and as usual, food was tasty and good.this time we enjoyed food with t20 match also, they projected the match over a screen  We ordered handi chicken and choley. Service was really good and fast Asit is the person who was handling our table, Was pleased with his gesture towards customer."
5.0,Amazing Indian food experience Ambience: 5/5 Food :4.5/5 Service: 5/5 Family friendly place.. Great discount with zomato gold else a little heavy on your pocket
5.0,The food is awesome and staff is very courteous especially Vishnu. Had a great time here. They even accepted our request for masala soya chaap which was not available in menu.
2.0,The food was very nice...but we ordered 3 shikanjis and it was around 280 bucks a bottle each with all the taxes...it made the bill explode by around 800+...but the quality of the shikanji was poorer than roadside...
5.0,"Had been there for lunch, nice and pleasant experience. Mr. Asit is very polite and friendly served delicious food and lassi with jet speed. Staff response is very nice. Highly recommended"
5.0,Very good service. Good ambience. Tasty food. Place is accessible easily. Enough parking space. Cost of the food in par with the quality of food.
5.0,Asit served and recommended us the best dishes. The hospitality made our lunch experience good. Recommend this place to have some authentic Punjabi North Indian food.
5.0,Food was great... Butter chicken was amazing... And the ambience was also good. Asit was very polite. He gave us complimentary desserts. Overall great experience.
5.0,The ambience and the food was extremely good. Dal Dhaba was the best and Butter chicken was delicious too.  The service provided was good and prompt. We had a nice dining experience because of the service provided by the staff (Mr. Asit).  Would love to visit this place again for the food.
4.0,Quirky ambience... Colors all over.... Very quick service by Asit...coming to the food....bestest dal makhani I ever had....paneer Taka Tak was taka Tak. :D would love to visit again...little heavy on pocket....but zomato gold saved us ... rating - 4.5
5.0,"Very courteous staff, delicious food, great ambience, I love coming here. Sushant is always so humble and helpful. Starters were amazing and deserts too...!!!"
4.0,"Great food..but some how i found the prices to be on the higher side, no doubt food is very tasty, a sweet lassi was around 160 or 190 which i found a bit highly priced for the ambience rest all was great"
3.0,"It was holiday but I had a long and tough day at office. So I had to pamper myself.  I didn't find a dedicated parking for this place. Ambiance is nice with some catchy tag lines.  I asked for butter and garlic nan, with the iconic dal makhni and ever mouthwatering panner butter masala. Nans were soft and great in taste. Dal makhni is by far the best I have had ever. Panner gravy was dissapoting as it was bit sour in taste.  Service was lighting fast.  Again one more restaurant in town who charges service charge.  This is place is worth trying but I give one  less because of the parking, sour gravy and service charge.  I paid a recent visit to this place again to explore the non-vegetarian options. Food was good. On the second visit I tried to compare the food and price with others and found this place is a bit costly than others."
1.0,"When you walk in to this place you fell for the interiors. It takes you to actual Dhaba. This gets you a confidence that this place is worth it. They have almost every north indian dishes. I actually had went to have Sarso da Saag. They managed to get the dish picture on the menu but the they dont serve the famous Punjabi dish. When asked why, I was told they have changed the menu. Strange!! I ordered Soya Chaap which was normal not extra ordinary. Then come the Masala Papad, normally I have always seen Masala vegetables over the papad. But here 2 papads cut into 8 pieces are served with masala vegetables on a separate bowl. You have to put those over papad and eat. This is not how Masala Papad is served. Restaurant had actually ruined the dish. We ordered Kadak Paneer as a mains. To my surprise this dish which should be spicy was sweet. The taste was very disappointing.  Now me and my friend have upset stomach.  Overall the experience was pathetic."
5.0,Everything about this place was absolutely fantastic. Yummy food & very friendly staffs. Biryani and butter milk was too good. A must visit.
4.0,Beautiful typical punjabi place!!!  Amazing kababs Not really a place for vegetarians  Galouti kababs a must try  Truly heavenly  A food lover can understand what I mean when I say heavenly!!!!
5.0,greatttt place. nice staff...best thing about the place is taste of the food which sure is a delightful treat for the taste buds. Ambience adds to the bonus point
4.0,"Located in the vicinity of marathahalli, is certainly a place to enjoy with friends and family and to have authentic Punjabi and Dhabha style food.  The ambience and interiors is amazing. Designed with a touch of dhabha as the name says.  They serve good quality and quantity of foods.  The staffs were on their feet to serve us.  Price are a bit higher.  The most entertaining is the dance performance from waiters and manager.  People can enjoy dance with food.  A proper Punjabi food venue to eat at.  My recommendations:  	Chitta Butter Chicken(My Favourite)  	Kadhai Mushroom.  	Amritsari Kulcha	  	Non Veg Platter(My Favourite)  Overall had a great experience here."
5.0,"I have been here for a dinner with friends.  The place has got the vibe of North India Dhabha with vintage bollywood posters and truck frame selfie corner. I love their playlist. These days we rarely found playlist Full of dhol, Punjabi and street songs. The food presentation is great. I was amused by the taste of Gulabo Lassi. We ordered Dal Dhabha, Butter Chicken 1986, Malai Kofta for main course and Veg Galouti , Murgh Seekh Tawa Masala and Masala papad for starters. Veg Galouti just melted in the mouth. An applaud to service too. Would definitely visit this place again on the bollywood night.  One tip: Please serve masala on the papad not on the sides."
3.0,"The food and service was great but their policy on zomato gold was super cheap. Instead of giving a dish free, they gave me one of my 3 paratas free. That was super lame of them. So you've been warned if you're coming here because of your Gold membership. Otherwise foods excellent."
5.0,"The best north Indian food I have had in Bangalore, so far. The service is extremely good, the ambience is great and the company - well that depends on you."
5.0,"Delicious food, and the most delightful service we've had in a while. Was a very laid back and fun atmosphere to dine at. Don't think twice about a visit."
5.0,"Amazing food !!! Butter chicken was top on..... lassi OMG!!!! And their garlic naan !!! Still can feel that taste !!! Suraj was amazing, he welcomed us with a smiling face and helped us with our orders!! Definitely would  go again!!!"
4.0,"Had been here with an office colleague. The ambience here is amazing, with proper Punjabi songs playing in the background, cots for seating and small quirky Punjabi quotes all over the walls. We had ordered Balti meat Butter naan Highway chicken Tikka Rasmalai( was too sweet) Each and every dish was perfect (proper Punjabi) but the quantity was less  The service is perfect  Prices are too high  Hygienic place  Overall a good place to go for proper Punjabi food."
5.0,"Of all my reviews, I am extremely happy to write this one for DHABA. This place is really good for all the food lovers especially North Indians, you can just get mesmerized with the taste. I really love this place...  Ambience: Too good, colorful, full of lights, pictures and all ...(5/5) Service: Good (5/5) all the attendants are very polite and on their toes Rates: Just fine (4.5/5) Taste: Wish.. I could just use some emoticons to express my joy (5/5)  Food: AWESOME :)  It was an engagement treat from one of our friends so we just opted for Veg & Non-veg buffet coupons at the time of booking,which was actually a good decision if you have more than 5 people.  I actually don't remember all the dishes but all of us tried both veg and non veg starters, they have wonderful options and it was really filling.. I will recommend just skip a meal and then visit Dhaba. Starters: I will recommend try aloo chaat, paneer tikka,chilly paneer, corn seekh kabab, Soya chaap was also there but I did not like it that much. In non-veg I really don't remember the dishes but try everything and just take one piece as your main course is on the way... Trust me you don't want to miss it...:0  Drinks: Beer/ jal jeera/ sikanji ... I tried Jal Jeera with sugar in it :) my combination (4/5)  Main Course: Do try Veg Biryani here (5/5) its wowwwwww.. They have around four option for Curd/Dahi.. I chose dahi bada- My Favorite...it was so yummy (all smiles). Veg options: Dhaba Dal: Ok Ok, Matar paneer: good , Chole: Too Spicy but nice  Non Veg: Do try chicken khurchan, if I am not wrong.. (5/5) really good try with a plain tandoori roti other options are in mutton ( which was very good as mentioned by friends)  Meetha: (You can use all the synonyms for yummy ;O) 1. Gulab Jamun : recommendation try vanilla ice-cream and gulab jamun... and close your mouth and eyes and feeelll it... 2. Moong ka halwa : Eat it with Rabri ... you can just go crazy... 3. Some yellow dish : Can't recall but it was ok, glasses are cute  Just visit this place.....Pictures are below....:0"
4.0,"Overall - 4/5 Food - 5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Service - 3/5 This is great place for someone who likes desi North Indian food. All the items carries lots of desi ghee. We ordered Galouti kebab (house speciality) and Mutton Rogan Josh. We also tried couple of different bread items (Lacha Parantha, Butter Naan & kulcha). All the items tasted really great. You will be here everytime you have an urge for desi food."
5.0,"The food was amazing, the ambience is also really amazing and the waiter pritam was also very nice. I would recommend all my friends to visit this place and visit again soon :)"
5.0,Great place to eat. Must try dal makhani. Pritam served us was very polite and in the end gave us complimentary desert. Ambience ok ok. Garlic nan was great
5.0,Very good place to eat. Staff was very good specially pritam. Ambience and food was very good . Dal makhni amd palak panner was specially good.
4.0,"Tasty but overpriced! Could have kept their dishes a lil less costly. Went for a dinner, ordered palak paneer ke seekh, amrisari chole, amrisari kulcha and naan. Food was delicious but not the worth of money spent on it! Like 269 bucks for 200 ml of shikanji, not done! Reducing 1 star for it. Overall experience was fantastic."
4.0,most of the items were yummm in buffet....had prawns n fish in starters which were bland...got heart ache after seeing the prices for lassi's / beverages....so didnt try n dont even try....for 2 people buffet including taxes paid around 1600/-
4.0,Great service and colourful atmosphere. Enjoyed the Dal Makhani! The music was too loud though. Shouldve been a bit lower. Nice experience overall.
5.0,Nice place to hangout with friend. Awesome tast and ambiance. Vishnu...who served us is exceptional. Eager to visit this place agian and again
5.0,Gaurav server us the yummiest dal makhni and butter chicken of bangalore. The ambience takes you to Punjab with lip smacking food they serve
5.0,"We ordered mutton galauti kabbab, dal tadka and jeera rice. Since, our intention was to go light on the food - daal tadka and jeera rice were perfect and delicious. The kabbab was sensational and a must try if your in Dhaba.  The ambience is colorful and the theme is Bollywood retro style dhaba. Service was very prompt - thank you Gaurav!"
5.0,it is a good choice for north Indian people like me. food was good and in weekday especially Monday will be good to visitbecause Monday it is less crowed.  Taste - Good 4/5  Ambiance - Great 4.5/5  Service - Good 5/5  Value of Money: 4.5/5
4.0,"The Kababs are amazing. Also, I never tried mushroom but took a step and tried mushroom for the first time in my life and this place did not failed in changing my perception. Please try the Kababs and Mushroom gravy in Main Course.  Hope this is helpful. Follow back for more reviews!"
5.0,"Food is delicious here especially paneer makhna masala and butter naan is also very crrispy and properly cooked Rarrar mutton was also gud. Staff is also gud ,Asit served us very well I just have one complain that cold drink they charged was too much"
5.0,This place has the best North Indian food.  Taste - Absolutely amazing  Ambience - Great  Service - Good  I basically had an awesome dining experience here. Definitely try their Chole and Paan Mojito.
1.0,"The quantity and quality both are bad. They are so overpriced. The money charged vs the quantity served is too bad. They have spent all the money of fancy packaging and forgot they are food chains. I ordered butter chicken from here and very disappointed. The pieces of chicken are bad ones, it doesn't smell good and taste is also very blant."
5.0,"Dhaba, has undoubtedly the best North Indian food in all of the Marathahalli-Whitefield area. Great many options in veg and non-veg both. The food is very authentic!"
4.0,"Really enjoyed the food here. The balti mutton and chicken butter masala was awesome. So was the ambience. Felt very satisfied with the conduct of staff, manager and overall presentation of the restaurant. But that costs your too dearly."
5.0,Good food ........ good service by Asit ............. great experience!!! Allergies were taken very good care of by the chef...... Will definitely recommend this restaurant!!!
1.0,Over priced and food quality not up to the mark..  we ordered Biryani but when we got it; it was looking more like a pulao. I would definitely never recommend anyone to visit here.
3.0,A good place to have food.  Ambience is fine. The staff is very good and courteous.  Do not order Masala Papad though. The first thing most people order disappointed a lot.  Curries were good. Breads could been better.  Overall it's a decent place to go. But there are better places.
4.0,Food taste is good .. service is nice . Amit is servicing in nice manner .. veg galouti is a dish to taste for sure . Location also very good
4.0,"The place is right next to raadison on marathalli main road..it resembles typical dhaba.... The ambience is soothing and nice. One thing I want to appreciate and talk about on top of everything is their staff.. everybody carry a warm smile and greet and listen to your requirements n respond and get you things soon as possible. Their recommendations are upto mark. We tried galouti kabab and amritsari machhi , chilli panner and dhaba style Dal tadka.. they have special tiffan panner main course which is very cute and reminds you of your school days. The gravy comes in one carrier box and the rotis in the another.. we also ordered lassi which was very delicious..on weekend I would suggest table booking as this place is always filled with People. Weekdays are good to go without table.booking.. the pickles they have is finger licking good...must try for some desi food."
3.0,Heard about the place so decided to visit which was long due.. but after visiting the place being a vegetarian not much options. Heard a lot of the dal but nothing great. The service was poor and the ambiance was ok nothing great. After being seated and placing the order it took a long wait for service. The best part was when we wanted to order the biryani the steward upfront comes and says sorry we dont have biryani. We requested him for asking the kitchen but he refused and said sorry we cant make it only steam rice we can serve.  The rudeness of staff was very bad. The food was not up to the mark. Much hyped place and not value for money the kind of portion they serve. The bread served basically the Amritsari kulcha was not authentic it is just like a normal stuffed nan.. the food was not up to the mark...
1.0,"a black dot in the name of punjabi dhabas, so so very over priced food items, and if at all u r charging so high make sure that your food tastes unique, so very unprofessional, god knows who the chef is, i ordered khara masala paneer i didn't get a drop of khara masala taste or the aroma then i ordered kadhai paneer worst ever kadhai paneer in my life, i can make better kadhai paneer than your chef...... you guys are cheating and swindling people , if i could give you negative rating i would happily do it"
5.0,"The food was very delicious. It was a bit over priced but totally worth it. I ordered dal makhni and garlic naan. They didn't just give me that. They gave salad, chutneys and hard candies. They delivered a whole experience. I enjoyed everything very much!"
4.0,"Typical dhaba food served here. It's quite pricy, if you've zomato gold it helps. Good ambience. It's usually a busy restaurant so make a reservation before you go."
5.0,"Food: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Staff: 6/5 Music: 4/5 Yes, an extra points for staff. Following are the reason: 1) I had a birthday in my group so visited Dhaba, and the staff where so cool that they gathered around and sang birthday song. 2) Also they had a full dance performance and it made the day special. 3) After every few minutes the staff will engage you also keeping in mind the space provided to the people who dine. Must try: Daal Makhni, Mawa Lassi and the mouth freshener. :) I would recommend every one stay around Marathalli area to visit the place."
3.0,"The Dhaba decor is the USP of this restaurant. The interiors are flashy and colourful.   Food 2.5/5 The food is very mediocre, at least for vegetarians. Not much of a choice and not a great taste.  Ambience 3.5/5 Its a dhaba type set up and to some extent gives that feel. Use of vibrant colours create a desi mood. But the mosquitoes are a turn off.   Service 3/5 Service is ok. Staff is polite and helpful.  Overall, its a highly overrated place.  Some items on the menu are highly overpriced."
3.0,"We went to dhaba for lunch...the crockery and ambience make you feel like you are in a proper dhaba...we ordered achari soya chap, Punjabi kukad masala,veg biryani and dhabe da Mitha...soya chap and kukad masala was good but veg biryani was such a disappointment...you can't call it biryani it was just rice and cauliflower with lots of chilli powder...and dhabe da Mitha was good but the quantity was too less compared to the price paid so again a disappointment."
4.0,I was there last month. It's was my first visit and really I enjoyed a lot food was excellent service was also. Ambiance was good. Thank you Team. Keep it up.
5.0,"Visited this place on a weekday for lunch after having heard a lot about this place. We decided to get the veg buffet because the options were really great and suited the price.  Starters: It started with chaat and Pani Puri and they had me with those two. The chaat was really authentic and flavourful. The Pani Puri was also good. The other starters included tandoori aloo, beetroot cakes, paneer chilly, paneer tikka, corn cakes. All the dishes were well cooked and tasty but I especially liked the tandoori aloo and the paneer chilly. The tandoori aloo is a must try in this place.  Main course: It consisted of the usual bread, rice, veg pulao, daal makhani, three veg curries and salads. Everything was quite nice with the right flavours, although I would definitely recommend the daal makhani. Very few places in Bangalore have such authentic daal makhani and this is definitely one of them.  Desserts: The best part about the buffet was their amazing spread of sweets. It had all varieties of sweets but I especially loved the badam halwa, phirni and the rabdi. Although the Jalebi had turned cold when we had it which kind of spoilt the taste.  The place also has a comforting ambience, great decor, good music and pleasant staff. I would definitely recommend this place for a wholesome north indian meal and ambience."
4.0,"Went here on a weekend for buffet..there is not much info on Zomato about the buffet menu..when I asked them they said it's bcoz their menu changes regularly...coming to the ambience, it's pretty cool and dhaba style except the seating...I liked it...the standout dishes for me were tandoori bhune aloo, chilly paneer, murgh malai tikka, fried chicken wings in starters..paneer butter masala, chicken khurchan, Dal makhani in mains..moong Dal halwa and phirni in deserts...few items I didn't like were mushroom hara pyaza, corn pyaaz ki seekh, tawa prawn, mutton biryani and rabri..I have attached the entire menu for the day in the pics..do check..they do levy a service charge which I was ok with because the service is very good .it's prompt and attentive...so all in all its a good place for buffet or ala carte for gold members..normal ala carte without gold is a bit expensive..."
1.0,I'm disappointed by pricing Who charges 230rs for chaas!!! It's very strange that a glass of lassi and glass of butter milk cost the same and I couldn't find butter milk on menu...
4.0,"Nice place for Punjabi food, I went there with my family. Ordered only veg food like Dal makhni, veg platter, kadhai paneer , garlic naan. Each and every dish was very tasty.one can feel the freshness of spice used in it. Specially Dal makhni was awesome. My daughter liked paneer tikka and cold coffee there."
4.0,A very authentic Punjabi / north Indian food restaurants I have been to. The starters were really good except chaap which was very bland and too chewy. Main course was really great but what stood out were the desserts. Really nice halwa with just the right amount of ghee and phirni are my favs
3.0,It's a poor and delayed service. Taste was a bit ok and hence the 3* rating. Spent like almost 1 and half hour just to have 2 varieties. Quantity of the dishes is also less and wouldn't be enough for atleast one person.
4.0,Been here for dinner. Ordered mushroom starter which was mouth watering. This place is cosy and they provided very good service. Roti Curry's were also up to the mark. Will definitely visit the place again.
4.0,"Colorful Dhaba feels with Punjabi/Hindi music beats just as you walk in~~  We ordered galoti kababs in starters which were so soft that it literally melted in the mouth. The waiter who took our order was really sweet too.His name started With A  Next they served us SANGHI GLASSES Which comprised of combination of a little bigger version of SHOT looking glasses from aam panna, sugar cane to various other Desi flavors to enlighten your taste bud.The presentation was quite appealing  - Butter chicken & Naan. Butter Chicken along with naan is happiness  which they prepared and served happily. Full Points.   -For desserts we ordered GULAB JAMIN Which was pleasant too.   Overall I loved the vibes there and would definitely visit again.I also heard from my friend that the waiters and everyone throw some positive vibes and energy by dancing around 8PM when everyone is dining. couldn't experience it this time but may be next time. :)"
5.0,"Superb food ...great taste ...mouth watering starters . Friendly staff ....what ever best you can say about their food and friendly staff service you can say it... Had a great time and yummlicious food... Right from the softness of galoti veg kababs in starters to the tenderness of chitta butter chicken in main course...All items make you happy and to made you say ""WOW ITS SO YUMMY"" loved the amritsari chole and daal makhani as well....and Missi paratha was the best as well.... Highly recommended must to visit with friends and family....it's near Radisson Blu hotel in marathahalli...just above @home showroom....perfect 10/10 restaurant..."
5.0,Awesome place.. great service .. great food.. served with smiles. Definitely recommended. Dal makhni was really nice. Authentic Punjabi taste.
5.0,"Food- 5/5 Ambience 5/5 Service 5/5 Staff- 5/5  I went with my husband and ordered only Vegetarian food. Starters- We ordered Veg Platter: consists of Veg Galouti, Paneer Tikka, Achari Paneer Tikka, Achari Soya Chap, Tandoori Bhune Aloo. Of all, Tandoori Bhune Aloo and Soya Chap standout and were very delicious.  Main Course- We ordered Daal Dhaba (Daal Makhani), Paneer Makhan Masala, Dhabe di Roti, Amritsari Mix Veg Kulcha and Garlic Naan.  Daal Dhaba was super delicious and so was Garlic Naan. Dhabe di Roti was average and the Kulcha as well as Garlic Naan could have been more crispy.  Quantity of dishes were good enough and price wise it is a reasonable restaurant.  Service was good and staffs were courteous and attentive.  Vibrant and lively Ambiance.  Overall great experience."
5.0,We went for a casual lunch on a Saturday. It was not too crowded and the ambient was pleasant with bollywood songs in background. The good was tasting really good.   sunnehari chicken Sheekh kabab . Decent  Butter chicken - delicious  Garlic naan - Very good   We were attended by Asit who has a nice smiling face and was very courteous. We got complimentary desserts too
4.0,Full marks to food and service.Ambience can be better. But worth. They have live music on wednesday and friday. Must try the tasty food if you are in marathali
5.0,"Such a lovely place amidst all flashy pubs and restaurants in marathahalli. Pure Desi feel with all those posters and frames shouting all bollywood taglines and famous dilogues along with colorful ambience to suit bollywood theme perfectly.  If you love bollywood you will instantly like the ambience as soon as you enter the Dhaba. In case you are wondering they must be serving only traditional veg or non veg food... Wait... They have all along with the daru sharu too!   Food here is quite affordable and also great in taste, we ordered one paneer starter along with mutton Tikki and fish fry with some beer  Mutton Tikki was so soft and succulent & full of foosgasmic flavors. Dish fry was also good and you must eat it hot as served to get all the taste. Paneer starter was good but as iam more into non veg so can't enjoy it much   They also hosts some lovely musical gigs like karaoke night and DJ akhada on I guess, Wednesday & Fridays respectively. We were there with my friend Kshitij who was hosting the open karaoke night where I got an opportunity to sing for all and staff was so lovely that everyone came and wished my for my good voice   After everything we ate, it was time for dessert and we tried Rabadi and badam halwa. Both were beautiful and a must try desserts.  Such a vibrant place is ideal for friends and family's of all age n type. A must visit place.

4.0,"True to it's name, Dhaba looks and feels like a north indian punjabi dhaba complete with steel utensils and punjabi songs.  I have been here thrice now and I absolutely loved the Butter Chicken, Dal Makhni, Galouti Kebabs(with tiny ulte tawe ke paranthe). Paneer Tikka deserves a special mention. I have never had such soft paneer pieces that aren't homemade. Another commendable but underrated thing was the whole wheat crisp tandoori roti. I love places which serve good breads.  Lassi could use improvement considering its an essential staple of the punjabi fare. It was a little bland.  The service is good and the staff is helpful and attentive.  Prices are reasonable."
5.0,"Simply put, the best place to have butter chicken and dal makhani in all of Bangalore. Its a tad expensive but if you have Zomato gold (which we used), it makes the experience all the more worthwhile.  The taste simply melts and makes you wanna revisit the place. Even the lassi here is pretty good and is as thick as i generally prefer. The ambience is like a dhaba itself and the staff is courteous and responsive as well.   I would suggest this place to anyone who wants to have good mughlai food."
4.0,"Nice place to dine in with friends and family. Authentic Taste. Friendly Environment. Nice Staff. Service was great. Quick Service. Applied Service Tax, but removed without question when objected. Only one thing which I didnt like was the quantity of prawns in tandoori prawns , for 3 Prawns they charge 1200 Rs + GST. I think they should think about this."
5.0,"Perfect north Indian food, everything is just amazing right from starters to main course, veg and non veg, lassi and paan and the flash mob by their staff. ""Yaha jao to jam ke Khao""..... Must try :- chicken Malai Tikka, veg platter and galoti kabab, kadai paneer & butter chicken, paratha tokri with lassi and paan. Made our evening"
5.0,Awesome North Indian food. Reminded me of delhi . Lachha parantha is very tasty. Very sweet staff. I had a great time with friend. We danced with the staff on punjabi music ! I highly recommend for North Indian cuisine.
5.0,The food was really great.  The ambience allowed the possibility of the whole rustic dhaba feel. We enjoyed the service and taste.  Kudos to the dance as well
4.0,Food- 4.5/5 Ambience- 4/5 Service- 5/5 Price- 4/5 Hygiene- 4/5  The perfect punjabi ambience and great punjabi food. This place has some amazing lassi and lovely dal makhani.  Details soon.
3.0,The ambience is good. Went there on basis of feedback served by Zomato users. I would say that the place is a bit overhyped . We ordered Galauti kabab that had more of cloves flavour and that was taking away the succulent meat's taste. Chicken curry was fine but their signature mutton gravy was just okish
4.0,I would like to begin with appreciating the staff members who were courteous enough and ready to adapt. That is the kind of service people look for even if it is getting too late they are humble enough to treat you wisely. The food was good. The butter chicken better than usual restaurants. Rest of the things that we ordered was good as well but i would make a special mention for dhabe di roti which made everything tastier. Also matka kulfi is better than the tikka kulfi.  The ambience is normal nothing fancy but the seating arrangement is quite organised.  Overall a good experience mainly because of the staff and the food.
4.0,"Carrying a legacy of more than 30 years, Dhaba Estd 1986 Delhi is a part of Azzure Hospitality (the same brand which runs the Mamagoto brand). Erstwhile known as Dhaba by Claridge, this one comes with a twist and gets you the Dhaba style food & ambiance in a restaurant. Present in multiple cities in India including Delhi-NCR, their origin, they have two outlets in Bangalore. This review is for their outlet in Marathahalli.  Was quite impressed with the interior, thats what I like the most about Punjabi restaurants. Funny Punjabi memes, vintage Bollywood posters and a rustic element to the overall ambiance certainly make it unique. Staffs were attentive and polite, thats made the hospitality a great experience.  A detailed review of the food is below:  Mocktails:  Sweet Lassi was a bit of a disappointment. It didnt meet my expectation of an original thick lassi. This was probably prepared in a mixer, not hand blended and hence more liquid. The taste wasnt bad though. The Virgin Mojito was good.  Non-Veg Platter:  We opted for this to get a taste of various starters in one plate. This had Galouti Kebab, Seekh Kebab, Murgh Malai Tikka, Highway Chicken Tikka, Amritsari Machhi. The showstopper was the Galouti Kebab  the speciality from Lucknow where the minced lamb kebab was served on a crispy Naan. Truly melted in mouth. Murgh Malai Tikka was prepared in white cream, absolute juicy. Amritsari Machhi was crispier from the outer layer, and tender from inside. Seekh Kebab was soft, but not juicy. Highway Chicken Tikka was average.  Butter Chicken 1986:  This one is their original Butter Chicken and strongly recommended. The boneless chicken pieces were soft and the gravy was creamy, making it one of the best Butter Chicken in the town. A must order during your visit.  Overall, the dining experience was pleasant with courteous staff and delicious food, not to forget the funny & casual ambiance with a Punjabi theme.  Happy EATING!"
5.0,Edited Review:  Visited this place again on the insistence of the Management to have a meal again and give them chance to change my view wrt to food and service.  Changed my rating for 3* to 5*  Reason: The main course meal I ordered was really tasty and good.. little less oily or buttery would have been better..  The best part of this place.. Attitude of staff.. really concerned about the customer service and satisfaction.  Wishing them to keep up with this attitude and Great Food.  ************************************* *************************************  1st Review  The Good part - Ambience.. decor.. service.. Menu options  The Not Good part - Food  Ordered Starters.. soya chap was dry and bland.. panner platters tastes of too much and only SALT.. and that to burnt.. sheek kabab was undercooked and loose.. couldn't gather courage to order the main course..  Only good thing was Lassi.. wasn't overly sweet like many places..  Overall.. overpriced for what they have to offer..
5.0,Butter butter and more butter. That's this place is all about. Truly Punjabi. The paneer is simply awesome and the ambience of nostalgic dhabha on road sides gives an informal feel. Good for groups.
5.0,"I can't give anything less than a 5 star rating to this place that spells ""Punjabi"" in every aspect - ambience, food and the music. Despite being a vegetarian, I was totally blown away by the place and trust me on that!!! Perfect for a team outing or family get tgthr..Started off the evening by ordering the variety of lassi that they have to offer..I haven't had better lassi in ages. They also have a splendid range of cocktails. For starters, we tried  1. Khade Masala Ka Paneer Tikka - Delicious in every bite..need I say more 2. Tandoori Bhune Aloo - Crispy and flavorful 3. Veg Galouti - Classic 4. Mushroom Hara Pyaza - Tasty  Main Course -  1. Dal Makhani - Can't miss this one ...u will surely be licking ur fingers 2. Kanastari Baingan Bharta - Fell in love with this one..what a flavor..even people who don't relish egg plant would enjoy it 3. Amritsari Chole - Reminded me of the true punjabi chole that we eat up north  Dessert -  1. Tilla Kulfi - Left me craving for more 2. Rasmalai - perfect way to end the meal  Breads are served hot and it's very soft and cooked to perfection.  Love the service and the staff is very helpful..enjoyed the music and the performance by the staff to some popular Bollywood numbers  Head there to satiate you north indian food craving..."
5.0,"This place is love. From menu to the service, everything was so good. I would especially recommend this dessert( dhabe da mitha), it was delicious.  And last of all, the service from ASIT was exceptional."
5.0,"I have been there with my wife for dinner. Its Ambiance and live music is very good. They are serving with lovely gesture, food is also good 4+ was served sooner than expected Staff were nice & friendly. Also that day all staff done flash mob with everyone."
3.0,"had a tasty meal of kofta, tandoori paneer, amritsari channa, lassi, zeera rice. but the downside is they sell water bottles which costs 100 rupees per litre! we can get 10litre water for 100rupees at shops outdise. water is essential source , it is inhumane to sell a water brand that marks its price as 100rs."
4.0,"Food - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Service - 5/5 Hygiene - 4/5 Price - 4/5 Parking - 4/5 Fire Safety- Fire safety device available and secondary exit is accessible to customer. No exit points blocked.  if you are from Northern part of India and you are missing the authentic Dal Makhani Paneer, Butter Masala and host of other North Indian delicacies, this is the right place to head out to.  I kind of judge Punjabi food joint by the quality of lassi and dal makhni they make. And I must see that they were almost a perfect 5 on both the aspects.  The moment you step into this joint, the Ambience is something very catchy and attractive. it has a true blue Punjabi essence and Dhaba feeling. I really liked the posters of yesteryear Punjabi dhaba which used to be the case in undivided Punjab. They have very nice posters and artwork depicting the Dhaba culture and also the Akhada culture or the wrestling culture in other words. You could see the medal ranking of different wrestlers mostly from undivided Punjab, part of which currently is in Pakistan.  Their ala carte menu has unique way of serving and the presentation is really very nice. However we had gone for a buffet as a part of a review invite.  we were welcomed with the Grand glass of lassi which had All dry fruits and a very thick curd which was just the right amount of sweet. It was delicious and a great Lassi that I had over a long period.  They have a dedicated chaat section where you get on North Indian chaat that you want. We had pani puri and Dahi papdi both of which were amazing.  Pav Bhaji was also very delicious to have.  the assortment of veg and non veg Kabab and because they also very delicious especially the Amritsari fish Tikka which was amazingly tasty.  Mutton fry was also very delicious and Nice.  Kadhai Gobi had that slightly burnt and roasted Aroma of gobi which was mind blowing. This was by far the best days I had including the non veg delicacies.  Palak paneer was also very soft delicate and made with the right amount of spinach in the gravy.  Dal Makhani as mentioned already was amazing and I really help myself with two bowls of it.  The Roti was very soft and delicate and we chose butter naan.  Beliram ka Meat was tender Meat cooked in whole spices and tasted just great. The fragnance was nice and enjoyable.  In dessert section, jalebi was not that great. Firni was ok. Gulab jamun was amazing. Mousse was good as well.  Considering authenticity of the Punjabi food I was really very pleased and would like to congratulate and thank the management and Chef for maintaining this good quality of North Indian food.  Thanks again and I was humbled to have been invited for reviewing the joint."
5.0,"The food is really nice, and the ambience is authentic dhaba-like. The service and attitude of the waiters (especially Asit) is extremely good."
4.0,"I had been here for a team lunch buffet . The food wasn't quite up to the mark or rather what we had expected after getting good reviews from friends. If zomato would have given the option of 3.5 then may be that is what I would have rated them, but the extra marks goes to the vibrant decor.It definitely adds on to the charm of the place and also lifts up your mood.  Food-3 Service-4 Ambience-4.5"
4.0,"Good authentic punjabi food, polite and friendly staff,Asit served us really well. Gelauti kebab is must try. They conduct live music on Wednesday so that made our evening."
4.0,"A typical Punjabi themed restaurant. Loved the ambience. Polite and courteous staff. Good service. Food is delicious. On our visit the staff performed a flash mob. On special request, they organised for cake and even play a birthday special song"
5.0,Quite a nice ambience with quality food.  For starters we ordered just Dhaba paneer tikka as we were only two people. It was amazing in taste and feel. Main course: Ordered Amritsar Kulcha and lachchhaa paratha with Paneer makhan masala. It too tasted great. Then we ordered Rabadee for dessert and it really was a delicious one. The team was great and well behaved.  Overall a great experience. Thanks team Dhaba Marathahalli.
4.0,Nice food and polite staff. Have been to this place twice and each time amazed by the smiles and politeness on the faces of the staff... Half of the mood is made by their generous brhaviour and rest is taken care by the food .....
5.0,"If you crave for authentic dhaba style North Indian food, then there's no place better than this.  We ordered bhatinda chicken, dhaba chilli paneer, chicken tikka, mawe di lassi and kesari phirni. All the items were extremely delicious and totally dhaba style.  Also service was fantastic, specially assisted by Asit. Really impressed and satisfied :)"
5.0,"Being to Dhabha last Friday (my 3rd visit) and as usual the ambience and service was diligent, the staffs were very polite. We ordered Galuti kabab, Paneer tikka, and chicken kabab which was delicious. We had amristari kulcha, Dal Makhani, Balti meat and Jeera rice which made our evening. Don't forget to have Rabri and Rasmalai. Overall it was a great place to visit if you like pure North Indian Punjabi food it's a must visit."
5.0,This is my first review on Zomato and I m putting this just because this restaurant deserves more than 5 ratings. Starting from the entrance the desk which says Aao Swag Anusar to the interiors of the restaurant. Quirky quotes on the wall . Movie posters of early 90s on the walls.  Lets come to food now  Amritsari Fish - 5/5... such a nice flavour Gul reminded me of Local street food of Amritsar  Paneer Tikka- 5/5. I never had such a soft paneer in whole bangalore .  For mains:-  Chole- 5/5Truly flavourful reminding of Amritsar Bhatinda- 4/5. Need little bit of balancing of spices.  For Desserts:  Dhabe Ka meetha- 5/5 its like 4 desserts in a small earthen bowl. I never had such an amazing dessert in my life.  For drinks:  Virgin Paan Mojito- I never thought a mojito with Paan. Its really worth trying   Service - 5/5  Such a happy face all around since we enter we till we left the staffs are really courteous and they know the products. Special shout out to Asit ( May be Im not sure) who helped me in suggesting food and it was worth trying according to his suggestions.   I complained about the spice level of Bhatinda curry and the manager Mr. Avinash approached to the table and got it replaced with a fresh one and they didnt even charged for it. It was a nice gesture from him.  And at last the staffs performs a small gig on top punjabi songs which is very unique.    Kudos to the entire Dhaba Team Had an wonderful experience will definitely visit again.
1.0,"Food is average. Good ambience. Courteous staff. I was disappointed with the pricing here. Just felt it was not worth it. And who would charge 250/- for a glass of butter milk which is not even placed in the menu, right thats a very clever move. Obviously everyone would order buttermilk or lassi in a punjabi style dhaba, so remove the pricing off the menu and cheat ppl wow. Never going back again."
2.0,food is good but the cost is very high
4.0,Must try mushrooms which they serve in platter. They also served me only mushrooms in place of other vegetables on special request. Their pan mojito is something you won't find anywhere else. Very refreshing and just perfect. Also the ambience is nice. only thing is little slow service when it's crowded.
4.0,"Food is good, ambience is also good, staff are customer friendly but service is slow and somewhat feels disappointed when you don't get food on time.. just need to work on timings rest very good"
4.0,"It has typically bollywood styled theme with all retro posters images etc.. I could not see any source of natural light at all, decorative lights are good however. Service was very good. Helpers were ready to serve and attentive. Food quality and quantity both are above average but very costly  Paneer makhan malai and murg malai kawab both were very tasty. One starter One main course 3 breads will easily cost you around 900-1000 rupees."
5.0,Great choice in the buffet. Tasty food is served here ...... Welcoming staff they customize the food for us I would recommend this place for sure.
4.0,"A bit expensive but the food is worth it. So are the desi drinks. Ambience is descent. Service is quiet good (which accounts for extra Service Charge apart from GST on your bill :D). Overall, a good place to have some nice punjabi food for dinner."
4.0,Really nice service. Very few restaurants offer the sort of service that this restaurant offers. Courteous staff. We ordered veg galauti kebab which was really good. Dal makhni is awesome. You wont get such dal makhani in most famous restaurants. Butter chicken is also good. Would visit again to try other dishes. Ambience is good. Drinks are costly which is a turn off. But overall very good experience.
5.0,"This is a must visit place, very colorful , lively...entire staff performed on couple of songs and they were in sync..staff was very helpful.. service was good..food quality was nice..must visit for next time.. Afghani chap was very nice Dal makhani was very nice"
4.0,Visited here for team lunch. Good place and good food. We enjoyed a lot. Good music and ambience. Team danced a lot. Polite and generous staff
5.0,owsam..... good food and best service.... enjoyed alot. starter also good and the test of food is mind blowing. we had team outing and the service provuded is very good
5.0,"Its a grt Nd decent place in Marathahalli, they have a wide spread of buffet in lunch Nd a la carte in evening   Balati Mutton Nd dhaba daal , a must try food ,  If u have a team its grt place to visit Nd evening is suitable for family affair."
1.0,The food cost in the menu are too much expensive when compared to other restaurants. Also in Bill they included service charge and we noticed and they gave a new bill without service charge. Will never visit & suggest this Dhaba to any of my friends & colleagues. Worst
5.0,Amazing place ..i love to come again nd again.food is very gud...specially pritam service is very gud.polite....i love this place very much....
5.0,One of the best places at Bangalore if you like North Indian Cuisines. Not so costly. The staffs are really well trained to serve the customers.   Ambience- 5/5 Food- 4.5/5 Hygiene- 4.5/5 Staff- 4.5/5
4.0,"Ordered biryani,less quantity.. Really delicious food..but it is pricey.. Got well packed food, requested for extra raitha and they considered our request....happy with it."
5.0,"Started with nimble bites, loaded with richness of Delhi style aroma and songs, upbeat cameo by the Dhaba staffs- dancing and whistling on Punjabi Pops made the place more alive. Bijoy, helped us in easy navigation among the choices and present a welcoming smile."
4.0,"Food is nice i had khadai panner , dal tadka very good taste   paan moijito is must try Service was just ok  Ambience is good, will recommend it  But prices are on the higher side"
5.0,"Amazing Food. Amazing service. Amazing experience. Got 2 complementary Shikanjis which was a nice gesture. Overall, would definitely recommend if you are looking for Punjabi food in Bangalore."
3.0,Very average food.  Butter naans could have been better. Panner Makhan maar ke was not upto the mark. It lacked the sweetness of Makhan. Also it smelled different.  High Price does not justify the nostalgia of a yesteryear dhaba.  Price 1/5 Food taste 2/5 Food quality - good Service 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Not a place I'd visit baar baar
3.0,It is very pricey compared to the other restaurants in Marathahalli. The cocktails were not that great as well. This place has a huge scope for improvement if they really consider to reduce their prices and probably cut down a bit on their potion size as well.
3.0,"Food - 3.5 Service - 4 Ambience - 4.5  Welcomed with a smiling face and scouting to the seat...staffs were having smiling face all the time...  We went here for a family outing on a saturday evening...I liked the Punjabi ambience, food is absolutely delicious (homely taste). Everything was good but I've deducted rating in service as we had to wait longer before they served the starter and same goes with main course, otherwise it is good.  Food ordered: -  Rumali Roti Chicken Tikka Jeera Pudina Pulao Butter chicken with bone  Rumali roti was kind of normal roti which was rolled thin and made large...which was a big time dhokha for us, as Rumali roti should be extremely thin and soft like any Rumal (handkerchief)...  If you are an Indian cuisine lover, then this is absolutely a recommendedplace for any occasion.  P.S.: - But yeah in comparison to price, the food isn't that good..."
3.0,The ambience was kind of ok .. Food also was not that great .. We had vegetarian only but I personally found it little overpriced.... Service was good .. So overall 3 rating ..
5.0,"we went on a friday evening there was a dj playing songs..this was my second visit in Dhaba..the first time was on a sat evening the singer was singing of songs of kishor,rafi which was perfectly in tune with the ambience..now coming back to food Had balti meat,bhatinda chicken curry ,garlic nun, chicken takatak ,amritsari machhi,punjabi kukkad masala,amritsari kukkad,missi tandoori roti,amritsari kulcha,lassi,pudina based cocktail,rasmalai,rabri..right now can vouch this as the best dhaba in town..those who havent tried it yet must try this place..service is also very good .."
5.0,I visited the location with a colleague. The location has a lot of good vibes. The ambiemce and the staff attitude is very nice. We ordered 2 items(one was a starter and one main course). Both of the dishes were amazing.
5.0,"Awesome food, ambience is amazing, the staff here is great too. Do try out Galouti kebab and paneer butter masala. Best place to celebrate birthdays."
4.0,"If you are up for the dhaba wala ambience like me you should try this place once. Though the decor is not that of a dhaba, but with the live singing and the noisy environment it totally gives that feeling. The staff is friendly and helpful. Thanks to Asit for his services. Coming to food I would rate it at a 4.5. Tried the kadhai paneer which was pretty decent with the paneer being all soft and creamy. The fish tikka was fresh but flavours could have been better. The Dhabe ka meetha was a good option though the rabri was the best out of all. Fridays are the DJ night. And this time I was blown away by the mutton. The seekh kabab, gilauti and the balti meat. Cannot decide which was the best. Guys it's one of the best mutton you will find here."
2.0,"I feel that the food was good, however service was not as great as expected, management in taking order and delay in getting food to your table was a bad experience"
5.0,"Asit provided really nice service and food was tasty Liked the ambience Tried mushroom masala,lassi and naan Mushroom and lassi was worth having"
1.0,"I specifically instructed for non spicy palak paneer but it was way too spicy that none of us could eat. Since this was delivered to home, nothing could be done. Disappointing."
5.0,"I came to know about this place via Zomato Gold. The ambience, service, food was top-notch. We ordered Dal dhaba, Dhaba chilli paneer, Garlic naan and tandoori Rotis and we're not disappointed at all by the food. The portion was more than enough too. The food arrived quickly. Asit waited our table and we were pleasantly pleased. He was jolly and polite. Overall, it was an amazing and fulfilling experience! Would definitely visit again!"
4.0,Good place for North Indian dining ..... the dhaba ambiance is really cool ... overall a nice place to hangout.. will recommend to try if u like to have North Indian food
5.0,"Thanks a lot for the lovely service. They are always serving with a big smile.  Special thanks to ASIT, he is a very kind and really nice person. Thanks a lot for making our day so special."
5.0,"Nice place to hangout with friends and family. Staff courtesy are very good. Well behaved staff and services. Food is really tasty, in South India you will feel real Delhi taste."
5.0,Excellent service....i would love to come again. The staffs are very polite and one waiter vishu is very good...the food quality is nice.....
5.0,"Great service and really tasty food. Special mention to Vishnu, our server. Really polite guy. Food came very fast and was amazing. We visited on Wednesday and they have Bollywood karaoke night on Wednesday and that is super fun."
4.0,"Ordered veg galouti kebab, one of a kind taste for vegetarians, must try. Loved dal makhani and paneer makhan masala. Missi tandoor paratha. Got live music here every Wednesday. Very pleasant experience. Good ambience. Polite staff. Only downside is food is bit pricy."
3.0,Honestly I didnt find the food very tasty....... I think it was average but what I did like was the service which was quite prompt. The decor is rustic and I didnt find the karaoke that great.
2.0,"The food was good and so was the ambience. However they added service charge to the bill and applied GST on top of it. As service was plain average, guess a mandatory service charge makes this as my first and last visit to this restaurant."
5.0,"This is a must visit place. Very lively, Very Colourful. We were here on a Wednesday and they had a live karaoke session. The singer was amazing, singing all bollywood old hits from Amitabh Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor, etc. movies. At one point the entire staff performed on a couple of songs and they were pretty much in sync  We ordered  Palak Paneer Seekh - was very nice Amritsari Chole - again very nice Rumali Roti - Could have been better Missi Tandoori Roti - very nice Phirni - Amazing  Very much recommended place to visit."
1.0,Ordered online tandoori chicken and bhuna aloo. The tandoori chicken portion size are ridiculously small. Really disappointing. Will never order from there again.
5.0,"Are you a hardcore Indian cuisine lover like me? Then this is the place you should not afford to miss! The ambience will travel you into a typical North Indian dhaba with the lovely aroma of Indian spices. Not only that, you will find copper plates & glasses to make sure you do not feel out of place. I had been craving for some Butter chicken & some Paneer Butter Masala since long so I ended up ordering those alongwith some Stuffed Masala Kulcha To my utter surprise, food was amazing to the core & was served sooner than expected! Staff were nice & friendly. Ambience is of a typical Punjabi dhaba. And the washroom is filmy as well! I would surely recommend this place to everyone!"
5.0,"The balti meat butter chicken and dal makhni is just great ,then there are many traditional drinks must try . First time I have visited Dhaba in 2014 in Delhi but now they have so many branches in India..I have visited max off its branch its a surprise that they are serving same taste everywhere. will visit again to try other dishes in there menu . Thanks to Dhaba Team ..  Would recommend."
4.0,"Tried their North Indian thali and all their starters tasted delicious(Chicken,Mmutton Seekh kebab,Fish,Prawn,Papdi Chat,GolGappa,Pav paaji few more chats options as well.Main Course got Chicken Biriyani,Steam rice,2 Non Veg and 2 Veg curries,Curd rice,Salads.Special Mentions for their dessert sections Rabri is ultimate king here made of pure ghee and curd,Real freshly made cashew burfi,Kheer,Phirini all wonderfully tasted.Overall i would say old dilli wala ambience still maintaining the traditions and flavours.  Areas of Improvement : Please add some more sauce options like Tomato Sauce/Mayonesse etc. For desserts can add few more cake varities."
4.0,"The place was full with a lot of people waiting outside. Do make a reservation before going to this place. We tried the malai chicken and it was decent. The butter chicken was awesome, maybe the best I had in Bangalore. The Dhaba special desert which has a little something of everything was also good."
4.0,"Went here for dinner. You might have to wait for 15-20 mins on weekends. The food and lassi were good but the sides were very very tasty. Achar, mint chutney and imli chutney were very good. In starters we had tandoori bhune aalo, it's tasty but it's sweet(if you don't like sweet this might not be the thing for you). In main course we had panner makhan maar ke, paneer makhan masala(the spicier version of the former) and kulcha, lachha paratha and dhabe di roti. All of these were decent and tasty. Mawe di lassi was also good, it had a tinge of salt to it.  Taste - 4/5 Value for money - 3/5 Service/Ambience - 4/5"
4.0,"Dhabha with the name create confusion with the old Malgudi dhabha in that area. With the rustic environment, decor and punjabi food its a good place to try North Indian food. My recommendation is to go for buffer as they have large spread of snacks including mock tails. Loved the snacks overall as it was mildly spiced. The quantity and varieties of snacks is huge that we end up skipping main course. Dining experience gets kicked up with the Bhangra performances by the staff. Overall a decent place to enjoy punjabi buffet"
5.0,Awesome place with great ambiance.  Most preferable place for authentic indian food. Should try the chicken tikkas and the thandai. Great place for buffet as well. The staff over here is really good and friendly with a very jolly attitude. I came with my friends and really enjoyed the food with the music .  I would love to try this place multiple times.
4.0,A good place to eat North Indian food in this area. The food was tasty and thr staff was polite and friendly.  We have been to the place thrice and the experience was amazing all time. They do buffet in lunch and goes out if menu if you have some special request!
4.5,"Weve been to other branches of this outlet in Bangalore and Chennai and have always loved the food. However, The experience this time was marred by slow service - extremely and painfully slow. The food like always was brilliant - I always love the paneer starters here because the paneer is exceptionally soft and the galauti kabab is to die for. The paan based mocktail is also a must have as it is very refreshing and fairly authentic flavour of paan. The best element of our visit to the Marathahalli outlet was our server - Rahman. He was very patient in explaining and helping us pick dishes, and the best part was that he personally took responsibility for the delay in service (though he didnt need to) and apologised profusely for the same. Whenever he saw us waiting for food he would step by and assure us that he was working on getting it to us as soon as possible. My rating this time for this particular outlet would probably have been lower if it wasnt for Rahman!"
5.0,"THE BEST place around here to have some authentic north Indian food. I ordered Galouti kabab, mutton seekh kabab and Amritsari kukkad for starters which were all equally amazing and delicious. The best part was butter chicken. I've tried many other places which had butter chicken listed as their speciality like the Empire restaurant but they were all utter disappointing experiences. Kudos to the dhaba team for maintaining a good standard of north India food Cheers!"
4.0,I liked the authenticity of the food. There are very few resturants in bangalore which serves authentic north indian food. Dhaba is one of them. Taste was same as it would have been in a restourant in Delhi or Chandigarh. Ambient was aswesome. with music and dance. And it is pocket friendly as well. though I ordered gulauti kebab and it was not available. they served seekh kebab instead. but test was awesome.
5.0,"A colorful, Dhaba style warm ambience with 90s bollywood music to welcome you! Table reservation is recommended as waiting time could be really long.. The food is amazing. Highway chicken tikka and galouti kabab are a must have. Chicken takatak was average. The beverages did not impress me much and are a bit highly priced. Bhatinda chicken curry is delicious and all the breads are really nice especially the garlic naan and kulcha. Jeera rice comes with crips bhuna onion that adds on to the taste. This is a great place to be to enjoy a typical north indian/punjabi style meal with your family or friends."
3.0,"The ambience and the music was nice, the waiters set up the environment nicely. I heard good about the food but it wasn't up to the expectations to be honest. Mutton was horrible, Chicken was good enough and the Shakes we ordered in the end were something We could have bettered at home for 1/10th of the price. Good for a one time go as some starters are good. But otherwise it is Just another restaurant that merely disappoints with the Value for Money."
5.0,"Great food, must try ones are daal dhaba, paneer takka tak, amritsari kulcha and sheekanji. Staff is great. Its one of our favourite restaurants"
5.0,"Loved the ambience and food , dal dhaba style is must try. Tried sweet lassi as well , overall I would it's a nice place to go with you friends and family. Five star from me , surely they deserve it"
5.0,"Being punjabi I always in a search of authentic punjabi food and guess what?? I got it. Lets talk about Ambience: I would suggest to go on friday night, its DJ night there bcz u cant stop urself to dance when they play punjabi beats while having ur food. Cool punjabi quotation on wall. Food: Super delicious food We ordered rarha ghost, daal dhaba, chicken taka tak and sweet lassi. All this dishes suggested by their waiters bijoy and bishnu and believe me watever they told every dish was awesome. So must go and have delicious punjabi food."
1.0,Worst worst worst  Today visited this restaurant full spicy tasteless over priced food not worth it and no parking for this restaurant never dare to visit this restaurant again
4.0,We went here for a corporate lunch. The buffet was on a very decent price. The quality and options in the lunch buffet was wide. Ambience is very authentic punjabi style. The best part was when the entire staff started dancing in sync during the DJ.
4.0,"Visited this place recently. It is located in marathahalli. The ambience is rustic and it'll give you punjabi vibes. There is plenty of seating space available. The cuisine is north Indian.  Ordered tak a tak for starters. The presentation as well as the taste was brilliant. My friend ordered butter chicken 1986 and found it to be amazing and delicious.  For dessert ordered dhabe ka meetha which was a combination of Gulab jamun and Shahi tukda. I loved it. This place is on the expensive side but offers great food.  They offer zomato gold which makes it a good deal. Overall a great for North Indian cuisine lovers  Ps: My zomato gold experience here was not great. The staff is unsure about its terms and conditions, had to read it to them to make them understand. So they must improve this. ."
4.0,"This place comes hugely recommended for the experience that it offers. It's food, drink and merrymaking all rolled into one. This place deserves a solid 4.5.  Ambiance 4/5 Part quirky and part upscale dhaba. This place yells 90s kitsch all the way. The kaleidoscopic mosaic ceiling, the akhada, the neatly stacked soda bottles and tiffin carriers, the gold spot logo, the posters, wall art and the typical punjabi one liners are plucked from another time another place. All I thought was missing was a khatiya or 2 to really give this place that seal of authenticity.  Service 5/5 Exceptional is the word. Kid friendly place. The staff is warm, friendly and ready to serve. They put on a dance performance which literally brought everybody dining on to their feet. The energy was contagious.  Food 4.4/5 We tried a bunch of stuff. Galouti kabab and highway chicken tikka were great 4.5/5. For the maincourse we had balti mutton and a dhaba style chicken curry which were decent 4/5. The breads here are a stuff of legend 4.5/5. I especially liked the dhaba roti while the naan, pudina paratha, amritsari kulcha and laal mirch paratha were all great as well. I had the Aam panna which was decent 4/5 but everyone who had the lassi 5/5 were going gaga over it."
2.0,They have inflated the prices too much. For example 190 rupees for 2 gulab jamun. Besides that service was really good. They should fix their menu to stay in competition.
5.0,"Dhabha  ESTD  1986 marathahalli Marathahalli has dearth of great places for Punjabi fare  And Dhabha has made sure it sufficed this   Ambience:   The entrance provides a warm welcome to all the customers by various posters of Bollywood Actors and Actress and many quirky posters like babaji ka Tu. Add up to the charm.  Once you enter inside we get the feeling that we are in a rustic or native place like an actual dhabha on the highways, but dont worry the food and service in here is top notch.  They have live singing at times and live bands performing during weekends.  They play good desi numbers  Food 4.5/5  The food in here is pure desi da style  native one with robust flavors and made with loads of rustic spices   They have buffet option during lunch priced at 599 AI which is a boon for all corporate around  Then for dinner its only Alacarte  Been there with my close friends for dinner  Loved the below ones:   LASSI and THANDAI were amazing.  Coming to Starters my recos will be   Amritsari Fish tikka  Fish fillet coated with batter and some breadcrumbs deep fried and then served with mint chutney and some sliced onions.  Tandoori Bhune Aloo  the baby Potatoes, fried with simple spices, onions and served with mint chutney.Simple one tasted good.  Mutton raan  a must try dish for all mutton lovers trust me this is their USP  Lamb leg pieces marinated overnight and cooked for a long time over tandoor and then served along with some sheruwa , the meat was soft and had the right amount of spices not overly done remarkable is the word.  Mushroom Hara Pyaaza - Fresh button mushrooms cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spring onions.Tasted great  Dhaba wala Paneer Tikka  this is a show stopper again  freshly made cottage cheese(paneer) chunks marinated well and then cooked in tandoor, has a hint of saffron to it.  Main Course :  Lucky to get, Sarso ka Saag and Makke Di Roti   Makke di roti  made with corn flour  perfect topped with butter, and then saag is simply wow  Gharrr ki yaaad aagayiii  Amritsari Chole  The perfect chole I had in recent time cooked with chickpeas in rich tomato gravy.  Dhabhe ki roti is unique in terms of taste and goes well with malai Kofta curry, worth a try.  Laal Mirchi Paratha - Wheat Tandoori Paratha which is sprinkled with some red chilli Powder tastes good.  Amritsari Kulcha - Stuffed flour bread cooked in clay oven topped with butter.perfect and goes well with Butter chicken curry.  Service -4.5/5  The staff are really polite and they do their best to make sure one has a surreal experience out there.  They are very alert and make sure that they never give us a chance to complain about anything. That is a fabulous job team and they always have a warm smile and are ready to correct upon things if any one has issues . Keep it going team  VFM  4.5/5   Felt that the prices are slightly on higher end, cost for two without alcohol would come up to 1700 odd  But they would patch up with the great food they got to offer and also their service and warmth  If you are in search of a new place for trying good pujabi fare  may be Family dinner or Dinner with best friends ,team lunches this is the place to be ,  Im sure Team Dhabha Estd 1986 would ensure that it turns out to be a memorable experience the way it has been in our case  Thank you team  you all deserve a huge round of applause"
4.0,"It's a nice place for lunch. Ambience is really good and staff is super friendly. They offer a lot of complimentary stuff also, varying from customer to customer. Do try their dal makhani and Don't go for tiffin paneer. It tasted bad even though the ajwain Parantha served along with it was sumptuous. Overall a good lunch place"
5.0,"Craving for a good home like food drew me to this place.Talking about the ambience,it gives you full Punjabi feels.Food tastes really nice.Though its a bit pricey but the quality of the food overshadows it.Moreover the quantity is more.Tried their Matar Paneer with Naan which was delicious.Tried the Badam Halwa which tasted really good.Also they have a awesome tasting Lassi.Its a good place to visit with Family.Service is quick and staff is courteous.Had a good experience visiting it."
5.0,Amazing food and ambience. Complementary drinks were awesome. Bishnu did an amazing service. Very helpful. Even the dessert served was superb. Try rasmalai.
5.0,"We have been to this restaurant last weekend though it was in my list from long. And i would really like to appreciate the team and I am sorry dont remember the name of staff person who served us but that guy was so generous and helpful throughout.  Lets come to food - I am a vegetarian so we have had Some paneer dish and daal makhni.. that was so finger licking! They had served complimentary sweets to Us. Thankyou for this wonderful gesture! And i would like to tell you sweets were amazing!!! Desi Indian sweets - gulab jamun, rabri jalebi, moong daal halwa and few more!!"
5.0,Really nice place. Great ambience. All for Rehman when U come here. That guy is really courteous and really tried to enhance ur overall experience. Appreciate the extra effort
5.0,"I entered dis place and i start dancing d place is really really nice ambience. Am a sindhi guy and sindhis love to explore every place and eat, am one of dem i love to eat delicious food and i reached here i heard ao many times bt never been der and my experience was really awesome and am an pure pure non vegetarian so i ordered baalti meat , dhaabe di daal n mix stuff kulcha and all three was super se v upper dishes. Actually i have a vegetarian frnd also he will always wid me to explore d food so will always order veg dishes also and daal i tell u it was really really superb in taste. D waiter name called Bijoy and Bishnu both are awesome waiters in service, nature all good. So frnds visit dis placa and taste d food both veg/nonveg.. Thanks Bijoy & Bishnu."
5.0,"Little overpriced but every penny you pay is worth it if you are a non vegetarian. Although even the veg galouti was pretty amazing. The best part is the vibe of the place with the bar and the desi tharra style cocktail drinks. If you tell them its someones birthday, the waiters do a desi version of a string quartet by dancing on batameez dill and the entire place gets ten times more lit after that. And them north India feels shizzz! I personally kill for that."
5.0,"Good food now, good service. Management is taking steps to improve the quality and maintain it. There were some issues with delivered food in the past but, the manager followed up and made sure to understand the problem. My second visit has restored my faith in Dhabas food."
5.0,"After a long day, stretching upto 11:00 we were famished. And when you are in Bangalore, it is a race against time at this hour as most of the restaurants are closing. I was frantically looking at closing times in Zomato. After 2 false calls - the restaurants closed prior to the time published on Zomato - we finally landed at Dhaba and were given a smiling welcome. First impressions, the decor matched upto the name with bold and vivid colour murals, utensils stacked up against walls, wooden tables (though no Khaats) and a well stocked Theka. We were accosted by the smiling Bishnu ready to take orders, with the obvious caveat last order :-) We ordered Veg Galouti, a Veg Dum Biriyani and from the Theka I ordered their desi version of Long Island Iced Tea - Gulabo The traditional cocktail has been given a nice twist by adding Kala Khatta. It gets a zing and tastes real good. The Veg Galouti was very succulent with the right balance of exotic spices and a hint of sweetness. The accompanying small meethi roti though could have been a bit crispy. The Biriyani was served in the same earthen pot that it had been cooked in, with the lid and layer of Dum intact. On being opened, it released a whiff of steam accompanied with the aromas of clove, cardamom and saffron. Taking spoonfuls of the Biriyani it was a very satiating experience. We also tried it with the accompaniment of Mirch ka Salan which was just average. What made the experience worthwhile was the warm service from Bishnu. While the Galouti tasted very well, but it was not piping hot. On being informed about this, Bishnu ensure that we get to taste at least one each of the fresh and hot Galoutis. It was a very warmth filled gesture. Further, whenever he was serving us there was sincere joy and care on his face, that made the experience even more enjoyable. The one additional star is just because of him. At the closure, though we were quite full, the manager served us with a complimentary bowl of Rasmalai. This was also quite tasty and appropriately soft and juicy. A very satisfying experience that left us with a smile. A must visit place!"
3.0,The starter here was bad. We didn't like anything both Veg non-veg and felt horribly bad that we were planning to leave the place and cancel the main course order. Somehow stayed back and Then come the main course and trust me. The best daal makhani and aloo gobhi in the town I had here. Daal was so creamy and tasty that every byte was leaving a taste of cream on my tounge. I use to hate daal makhani but this place made me fallen for that. Main course here was awesome. Must try place. Starters paneer tikka was very thick and not marinated properly at all looks like it was full raw. Kabab was also thick and tasting so bad. Shoraba was terrible. I recommend this place only for main course .
3.0,"Went there last night. Pretty crowded for a weekday. The starters, galouti kebab and paneer tak a tak were really good. And along with them, we ordered thandai and virgin paan mojito which were equally amazing. The let down was the service which was slow and the main course which were very dry(paneer makhanwala and chicken tiffin). We had phirni and rabri for desserts of which phirni was really good and rabri was average"
5.0,Landed here for team lunch with 25 people. Entering itself you will have a feel of punjabi and north Indian touch. Ambiance was pleasant with funky punjabi quotes written on different stalls. Cutlery also give u a free of heavy utensils with brass Base used in north Indian villages.
4.0,"Nice ambience - highway Punjabi dhaba theme spot on. Polite waiters and amazing food! Favourite picks are the Dhaba de Roti, Paneer Makhan and the Gulab/Gulkhand lassi.. the veg and non-veg platters are sumptuous and hit the taste buds right. If desi flavours are your thing, you must visit this place."
5.0,"One of the best places in Bangalore, after Kapoor's Cafe which serves authentic and tasty North Indian food. Gulabo Lassi is the highlight! A must visit with friends and family."
5.0,"Loved the service from Rahman. Love the food, awesome. The non-veg food is very yummy and the ambience is very warm. Love the service. Thank you Rahman..."
4.0,Its a great place to hang out and have food with your friends and family. Dal dhaba special is really worth ordering and its creamy texture will make you remind of north indian dhabas. Overall great just 1 star less as the service was average and if it improves on the same.. this is fabulous place for having dinner or lunch
5.0,"Right from the ambiance to the staff courtesy, speed of service, and the very food and drinks! No where to cut off marks from. Special mention for Rahman who managed our table and orders. He was extremely courteous and polite. Ensured we were comfortable at all times and helped us with selecting the dishes as well.  The cherry on the cake was complimentary desserts to taste as well as some meetha paan to end the day with.  We were really happy and impressed with the dishes we ordered. Masala papad, Tandoori bhune aloo, and Paneer tak a tak for the starters. The highlight for these dishes were the chutney alongside. Please do ensure you have their ""saunth ki chutney"".  For the mains - Sabz Patiyala, Daal Dhaba, Garlic Naan, Butter Roti, Sweet Lassi, and Dakshin Express (buttermilk). The show stealer was Daal Dhaba (daal makhani). Probably the best we have had off late, in a North Indian food place. The desserts were pretty great too. We tried Kesar Phirni, Kheer, and Gulab Jamun. The phirni and kheer were just the right texture and the right amount of sweet too. Finally, coming to the decor and the feel of the place - out and out Punjabi excitement to it! You will see colours everywhere, quirky messages and reminders, a kickass and swanky bar, as well as some cool music in the background. You are greeted outside in the corridor with a sign that says ""enter swag anusar"".  All in all, a complete package for a lunch or dinner date. They apparently also have the staff shake a leg when the crowd is in full swing over weekends. Looking forward to experience that!  Only one glitch - steeper bills! We paid over 2K for a two-person lunch, without any alcohol!"
3.0,Overall food was Good. Lassi is too costly which is not mentioned in the menu. Ordered lassi for 5 people which cost 1200 alone. Ambience is pure dhaba style with some music.
5.0,"Dhaba Estd 1986 Dehli, Marathahalli is a great place to dine in, delicious food, great ambience and staff is too good.. Specially Mr. Rahman who served us this evening made sure we are leaving the place with happy faces. Also we got many complimentary treats. Would definitely visit again and We highly recommend this place."
5.0,"Excellent food , service and unbelievable hospitality from Robin. Very positive and cheerful place. Interesting menu too. Keep up the positivity!"
1.0,"Ambience good, bad service, too loud music, food overpriced, service was extremely slow. Cutlery was so bad that even a roadside dhaba will have better."
5.0,"This is my favourite restaurant for Indian cuisine in this area. I have been there couple of times and this place serves delicious food topped with extremely courteous service. I have tried butter chicken, matar mushroom. In addition to the absolutely delicious main course, they also served Complimentary Phirni. This place is a definite recommendation for its service and amazing food. Rehman was a standout person whose service made the visit worth every penny."
4.0,"We went to this place for lunch after seeing the zomato rating. This place is a must visit for foodies for people who love traditional dishes like moong dal ka halwa, jalebi rabdi, Gulab jamun and great starters. We chose buffet veg .,.. and no regrets great food wide spread and most important value for money... go go go ... dont think twice .... just eat your heart out"
3.0,I have tried this place so many times in Delhi and have loved it. But somehow the same taste does not prevail in this branch. We ordered a starter which was ok and main course which was good. But I still did not find that taste which I was expecting. Maybe dine-in is better and ordering food is not a good option for this place.
5.0,Nice place with awesome service staff(Robin) . Food was good. I would recommend this place for everyone. Worth the money. Ambience is also good.love it
4.0,"Went for Sunday lunch with a friend. It's in a busy spot along Outer Ring Road in Marathahalli. I loved the setting that was there; it was very colourful but my friend who is Sikh and from Delhi cribbed about the stereotypical things mentioned on the wall :P  The food was good; Had paneer and chicken starters, followed by chicken tiffin curry and wheat parathas. The chicken starter stood out the most.  We were two people sitting at a two-seater table but the table itself was woefully small. It could not hold more than one dish, two plates and two tumblers.  Overall, it was a good visit."
3.0,"Came across this place while craving for some good Punjabi food. Food was decent but nothing outstanding I would say. The ambience is good with colorful walls, posters and furniture. But the DJ music was too loud to have some peaceful conversations. Better not to order lassi as a small one costs 230 bucks and it was not mentioned on the menu because of which people might order by mistake and realise on the bill. Food - 3.5/5 Ambience - 3/5 Service - 2.5/5"
3.0,"I went there with my friends to celebrate Friendship day.  Awesome Dhabba like atmosphere. All the dishes we tried are tasted great. I liked their Galouti Kebab and Amritsari Kukkad the most.  Staffs are friendly, but the service is very slow. They took 30 minutes to serve the starters also we have to wait almost 1 hour for the main course.  The manager offered us complimentary Papad for the delay."
3.0,"After hearing a lot of buzz about this place , I wanted to try this from quite some time and we end up going for a Sunday lunch. The place is next to AB's and in the same building as foxtrot. Surprisingly the place was pretty unoccupied for a Sunday lunch and more than half the table were empty. We decided to go for the buffet.  The chaats and starters are served on table. We started with Papdi chaat and panipuri. Chaat is really nice and crispy. Panipuri was average. Next came in the pao bhaji which was nice.  For drinks, I had ordered choti gillasiyan mocktail which is a mix of 6 different mocktail shots with shikanji, aam Panna, Kala khatta etc. This was unique and really nice to have.  For starters I had roasted pineapple, corn tikki, spinach cheese balls, paneer tikka, beetroot tikki, veg kebab, mushroom pyaaz wala, tandoori aloo. For me the only stand out was paneer tikka.  For mains, the veg options were kadai paneer, aloo Gobhi, bhindi masala and dal makhani served with breads, steamed rice and veg biryani. The paneer was nice but dal was exceptionally good.  In desserts, I had moong dal halwa, chamcham, gulab jamun, Hale u with rabri. The stand out was jamun and chamcham."
4.0,"Punjabi to the core, this place has a very authentic vibe. The decor has all aspects of Punjab, from an akhada winner's list and their trophies to the traditional ""aao ji Khao ji"" painted on a wall. We went for dinner and got a table within 5 minutes. The place offers buffet and ala-carte as well. We opted for ala-carte and tried: Sikhanji which was sweet and salty. Butter chicken was a winner for me! What taste! Simply yummy. Even the khumb matar was excellent. Lots of mushroom and peas in a properly cooked masala. We tried garlic naan,roomali roti. The naan had three pieces which was enough for one person. We tried matka kulfi as well. It was on point with the flavor and taste. The service is very good here. Very polite and prompt staff. They even apologized for the delay in food. The food is expensive here though. The curry prices were in the range of 350-400. I had zomato gold, so it wasn't heavy on my pocket but can't say for everyone. P.s. My actual rating would be 4.5 for this place"
1.0,"So, heard a lot about the place and decided to give it a visit. Dividing the rating in 3 parts, I would give: Ambience: 4/5 Food: 1/5 Service: 3/5  They have been able to capture the Delhi vibe very well within the four walled place with amazing interiors and subtle memories.  However, the food lacked taste and was very bad for the platelets. Except Tandoori kebab, nothing was good. We tried chicken curry, dal makhni, and paneer chilli and all succeeded in disappointing us fully.  Regarding service, it was a bit slow. The food took a lot of time to come out of kitchen. The staff also looked a bit busy. So I would say it as average."
5.0,Really a awesome place to visit and really a great service provided by the staff and especially by #bijoy and #robin you people are awesome at work  keep up the good work pals
4.0,Great ambience and food. Table management is good and Robin served our table really well. Food was served quickly and the presentation was nice.
4.0,Staff has been very friendly and helpful. Our order arrived on time so there was almost no waiting for the food. Lovely experience and attendant Robin is good too ! Highly recommend
1.0,Pathetic service. They drop pamphlets for home delivery and when you call them they say they don't have delivery service. No one picks up the phone for the Marathahalli restaurant!
5.0,"If you want to eat an excellent north Indian food and are looking for a great top class service and food quality, please visit Dhaba. It's outstanding. The food is excellent. The service is great, and the ambience is very original too. We had the buffet on a Saturday afternoon. It's very reasonable and at that price you get such yummy main course and so many appetizers. The appetizers were all fresh and warm - chili chicken, fried prawns, gol gappe, chat papri, fish fingers, malai chicken Tikka, chicken seekh kebab, baby corn, etc in case I missed a few. The main course has - butter chicken, keema matar, the most delicious Dal Makhani, tawa fish, prawns with saag... I mean we picked only nonveg coz we love it. Their food is very tasty and high quality. The desserts are lavish. My God I mean. I love the food. I belong to Delhi, so I got my Go-to place now near my house too. A must must visit. Our service was properly managed by Rahman. Keep up the good service with a very generous and always helping attitude. They have well trained people who will take care of your choices. Thanks a lot for an amazing lunch."
5.0,"Do you want to have a feel of a North Indian Highway Dhaba with authentic Dhaba like taste here in Bangalore?  -Dhaba Estd 1986 Delhi, located on Outer Ring Road near Marathalli Bridge is the place where you should visit. The place is very different from a normal casual dining restaurant. The rustic interiors give you a feel of a North Indian Dhaba, with Bollywood themed posters, Dhoodhwala Counters and many more. The food they serve here takes you to some Dhaba in North India. The service here is top notch and is worth mentioning apart from the food. The recipe they use here dates back to 1986, the year in which their first restaurant was opened in Delhi.  I went there sometime back with a group of friends and enjoyed the food and hospitality. Apart from delicious starters, main courses and dessert they do have some interesting take on cocktails with a desi twist. Though I didn't like the taste of most of the cocktails we tried, yet the Somras (vodka-based cocktail with aam panna syrup, mint and spices) was simply brilliant. Loved the presentation in which they brought the cocktails, looked just like a miniature version of streetside carts selling colourful drinks - brings back childhood memories.  I loved their overall food experience - from the starters like the Khade Masale ke Paneer Tikka, Galouti Kebab, Mutton Sheek Kebab, Amritsari Machhi to the main course dishes like the Amritsari Chole, Dal Dhaba, Baingan Bharta everything was top notch. The Paneer Tikka I had here was one of the best with chatpata flavours with the paneer being amazingly soft. The Galouti Kebab was also brilliant and melting in the mouth, served on top of small paratha pieces. The Amritsari Machhi - the fried fish Amritsari style was crispy with nice balanced ajwain flavours. The Amritsari Chole was something you usually do not get of that quality here in Bangalore - those dark coloured Chole you would rarely get in Bangalore. The Dhaba Dal was a perfect accompaniment to the assorted bread we had. The Dhabe di Roti, Missi Tandoori Paratha, Amritsari Kulcha - all were fantastic just like you get freshly prepared in the dhaba. They went well with the dal, Bhatinda Chicken Curry and Rarrha Gosht. The lassis you get here is also one of the best in Bangalore. I loved theirBadam Lassi and even the Thandai drink(which is not a lassi though, but a milk-based drink).  Finally, to end it all, we had some wonderful Tilla Kulfi (the one on the stick) and perfectly sweet Rasmalai. Special thanks to the staff there for an amazing service and entertaining us sometimes with a dance performance to some Bollywood songs."
1.0,For the price portion size extremely small. Never ordering from this place again

5.0,"Fantastic food , fantastic place and the most awesome attentive service!! Lovely decor, with a Sultan movie like theme.. Punjab recreated. We had Mutton Galouti, Chicken Malai kebab for starters. Each better than the other. For mains we had roti, Balti mutton , chicken curry chicken biryani followed by a glass of lassi. The food is fresh and has the perfect blend of all spices which burst in the mouth. Special mention for Mr.Robin, and Mr. Uttam.. for the terrific service!! Keep it up.. this place is a must visit."

3.0,"Good food but at regular intervals, the staff will dance and tyre sound is cranked up to crazy high volume. Also, but limited on vegetarian options but non vegetarian options are plentiful.  Not a place to be if you want to avid loud music"
5.0,"Landed here for team lunch with 25 people on Thursday afternoon. Entering itself you will have a feel of Punjabi and north Indian touch. Ambiance was pleasant with funky Punjabi quotes written on different stalls. Cutlery also give u a feel of heavy utensils with brass base used in north Indian villages.  Starters they serve on table with very fast service. Started with dahi papadi chaat it was amazing I alone finished the full plate. Coming to paneer tikka it was some weird taste of oil, but when i gave the feedback they immediately changed with a fresh one and not only paneer tikka , aloo was also spicy , they prepared a fresh one with less spices and gave mushroom also. Beetroot and peas aloo tikki were gud in taste. Chilly paneer tikka was okay okay. Paav bhaji was tasty and fresh.  Coming to main course, one can find all salads and pickles with variety of papad and curd. Daal makkani was awesome with authentic taste, you can feel the butter flavour. All curries were good.  Best thing about main course was they served the hot chapati 's on table which mostly restaurants don't do, they wait for order and then they prepare and give which make your curries and all cool.  Rabri was the show's topper in desserts, one can satisfy their sweet tooth. Badam burfi also fresh and tasty. They served hot gulab jamoons, maal pua, icecream, phirni , fruits and pan in desserts.  In between they entertain us with Punjabi music and live dance performance of all restaurant staff members surrounding us which tempted us to dance but as we were in middle of lunch we stopped but in last we requested them and they again played the music and danced with us , which was a wonderful experience . Everybody felt liveliness and joy .  Overall it was fantastic experience , highly recommend for north Indian and Punjabi food lovers."
5.0,"Visited this place on a Wednesday evening. I had a great time there. We opted for A-LA-CARTE.  Food - In starters, we had Khade Masala ka Paneer Tikka which is a must try. It tasted really awesome. It was soft and one of the best paneer tikka I have ever had. For main course, we had chilli paneer dhaba and various kind of breads. The portion for curry was good and also taste was good. In breads, amritsari Kulcha and palak parantha were best.  Service - The food was served quick and fresh hot. Staff was quite polite. Many of them came to our table to ask us how was the food and if we need anything else. Special kudos to Robin who was taking care of our table.  Ambience- It has that dhaba Wala vibe. The music was good. There was an artist who was singing songs in between and karaoke singing was available as well if someone wants to try. The tables were made of wood and both chairs and sofas were available for seating purpose.  Overall, it was a great visit. After using zomato gold, it costed us some 670 bucks for 2 people."

Polite staff, quality service, nice ambience and live music to top it up. 2 things which I highly recommend is their pan mojito and mouth freshner. This place gets really crowded during Friday evening and weekends. It's best to reserve table before you go there."
4.0,"To make a mark in Marathahalli, an area crowded with some known names and some upcoming ones, you really need to stand out. The dhaba, goes on a limb out here and does exactly what is required to make its mark among the best restaurants in the neighborhood. The dhaba has an ambiance that is bright and perky, takes you back to the streets of Punjab dhabas. The service is exceptionally good, where the staff does not mind to do impromptu on a few desi beats.  Coming to the food, we were there to enjoy the buffet. The Sunday buffet is for 799 (NV) and 699 (V). The spread of starters were good and with the addition of pani puri, it just steals the show. The only complain remains the pav bhaji, which was dry. The food was good and something you can look forward too. The jhinga saag stood out in the main course. The dessert platter was, well, not a big spread, but the items did not disappoint either.  In all, a perky place to be. With music, food and an amazing service, this place is sure to leave a mark."
3.0,"I went to this place with my friends. As expected this place is completely packed people are waiting outside. We ordered dhaba panner tikka and paneer taka tak for starters and paneer makhaan mar ke and dhaba dal in main course with garlic naan, butter naan and tandoori roti. Garlic naan and paneer tikka was not that good. But paneer makhan maar ke and butter naam were perfect.  Beverages needs improvement. Lassi was too sweet.  Overall Ambience 4 Food 3 Service 3 Price 3"
1.0,I ordered food looking at the ratings. But my experience was not good. The veg main course had almost no salt/ taste and the rotis were also not good.
1.0,Quantity is too less as per price... Not at all worth for a la carte........................ Will nvr order again...........................
1.0,"Nothing went well from order till billing. We ordered paneer makhan masala, roti, veg biryani and their special lassi. It took more than 45 mins to get the order, in fact lassi was also served after 40 mins. The food was not that great, paneer masala didnt had balanced flavor, lassi was ok but couldnt justify the price. The service is pathetic, you have to call the staff and ask for food, when we ask the manager he said he dont know why its getting late, may be too much rush. Thats not a sensible answer. At the starting of order we said we have Zomato gold and even after unlock they didnt took the id. Before billing we reminded of zomato gold still they didnt took id, instead gave just a discount on one lassi, as per zomato gold the discount is suppose to be on food and not drinks. I understood the intention of the staff trying to be clever but we were so fed up that we didnt argue and paid the bill. Another thing to note is that they are considering roti as part of zomato gold 1+1 .  So if I have 4 zomato gold and order 8 roti all my 1+1 is gone in rotis lol.  I had planned for team lunch next week for dhaba but not we need to look for a better place after such poor experience.   Even after slow service and ok food I thought of giving 2 star but after billing I dont have any rating better than this."
5.0,"Throw in Bollywood music and some North Indian quirk, and you have a winner!  Somras, Galouti Kebab and pinch of home sickness (Hawww! If you don't know I'm from North) will get me back here Again 'n' Again. If you haven't visited this place yet, trust me and pay your visit for a full-blown North Indian fare and thank me later.   Detailed Review:  Ambience..?  As soon as you walk into Dhaba, the loud decor and Hindi music from the 90s is sure to cheer you up no matter what mood you are in. The vibe here is very oye happy, happy oye. Endless corners to get full on Punjabi swag photos clicked to make your insta-feed poppin! Secret Tip: Dress up in Indian attire to get that perfect insta-worthy pic. I regretted that I wasn't wearing something Indian.  The restaurant aims for a dhaba but is significantly posher. Akhaada-style private dining area to Doodhwala counters to cheeky lines on the wall to soft drink bottles to vintage movie posters & kitschy collages, the decor is a retro throwback to the 90s.    Sip Sip Sip..?  And their Theka (bar) though! Has my heart. You got to try different colored desi drinks (mocktails & cocktails) in small glasses that came in a cute little cart.   My absolute favorite in the cocktail menu was SOMRAS ( vodka based cocktail with aam panna mix, mint, ginger, cumin and coriander).  What TummyTumms Liked..?  Food is rich, heavy and the portions are quite big. Brownie points in the efforts to maintain the AUTHENTICITY.   Mutton Galouti Kebab: Winner.  Served on tiny parathas, the soft and delicate kebabs were best had with mint chutney and plenty of onions. Mutton Seekh Kebab Amristsari Kukkad: The masala is packed with flavors and this dish is a must-have  Dhaba Paneer Tikka: Literally melts in you mouth Dal Dhaba: Is the real deal and its coming from hardcore non vegetarian's mouth. Amritsari Choley: Made me nostalgic. What flavors and that darkish brown color which you hardly get anywhere in South, made me miss Delhi big time. Matka Kulfi: Oh! so yummy.  What TummyTumms Didnt Like..?  Other signature cocktails except Somras and Gulaabo Mushroom Hara Pyaaza Presentation: Plating can certainly improve a lot.  Other Good Things To Order..?  Thandai: Very refreshing and filling. Gulaabo (cocktail) Mutton Biryani: Flavours can be improved. Rarra Mutton: Those succulent pieces of mutton Kanastari Baigan Bharata  TummyTumms Scoreboard:  Taste: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 (Special Shoutout to Asit for great suggestions, warmth and quick service) Value for money: 4/5 (The prices are not dhaba-like at all. But the food, though really good  If youre craving desi khaana thats wholesome and yummy and love a restaurant with a fun ambience, drop by Dhaba and you wont regret it!"
5.0,"The charm of eating at a Dhaba can never be compared or compromised with any other restaurants...this Charm is preserved and presented at THE DHABA-estd 1986 located  at Marathahalli main road.  The ambience of a Dhaba maybe the year of 1995 and beyond is created to absolute perfection and rakes up your old memories.  The service is good,the Waiters cheerful and they also dance at regular intervals to the old Bollywood numbers...  The place has a well stocked bar with a cheerful bartender too...

5.0,If you are looking for the best value food then this is it ! Awesome staff! Friendly behaviour ! We had a great time here!! You should must visit here ! The quality of food is outstanding !
4.0,"We went to marathalli outlet for dinner. The ambience looked like a highway dhaba and food was really good but little pricey menu. We ordered Murgh Malai Tikka, Rarrah ghost, Highway chicken Tikka, mushroom hara pyaz, Batinda chicken curry, Roti, shikanji and Lassi. Also service was good, also quick and staff were polite. Finally it's a authentic highway dhaba style food and very delightful with staff and service."
5.0,"Dhaba inside the city-Yes Dhaba inside a building-Why Not?!  Welcome to the Dhaba at Marathahalli just below Foxtrot on the ever busy main road.  The moment you step inside,the mood adjusts itself to the rustic Dhaba ambience. Be it the old Goldspot soft drink empty bottle,the advertisements on the walls or the dabbas lined upon one other.  The place at full capacity can accommodate easily around 100120 pax at a time.  The service is amazingly fast for the crowd they handle and the servers are ready to go the extra mile in keeping the patrons happy.  The place also boasts of a full fledged bar. However the bartender needs to learn the skills of cocktail mixing better.   The Music played is 90s Bollywood songs and is absolutely refreshing to hear great songs of yesteryears.At times the music is turned high and all the support staff and Managers including the bartender dance their heart out...WOW  The Starters tried were- 1.Mutton Sheekh Kebab-one of the tastiest dish of the evening. Done to perfection. 2.Amristari Macchi-any Seafood lover will fall in love with this dish again. Done to perfection. 3.Tandoori Bhune Aloo-one Innovative dish which has to be tried. 4. Chicken Tak A Tak- good 5.Murgh Malai Tikka- Done with the right spices and served to delight  6.Galauti Kebab- MUST TRY.  The Main course tried were  1.Dhabe Di Roti 2.Missi Tandoori Paratha 3.Amristari Kulcha  4.Amristari Chole 5.Bhatinda Chicken Curry  6.Jeera Rice  The absolute joy of eating the Indian breads with the curry just brought out my old college days memories of having such tasty food at roadside Dhaba.  The Desserts tried were-  1.Kulfi-Oh My Food(OMF) . Too good and must try foodies  2.Rasmalai-Good and just right.  A evening for 2 would cost around Rs 2000/- and is worth every penny.  The Restrooms are maintained well and the walls are plastered with old Bollywood photos.  As of me if am in the vicinity would love to go back again."
4.0,"The waiters were polite. The food was nice. I ordered the rharha mutton, galoti kabab, masala papad, crispy corn, paneer butter masala and dal makhani. The mutton was cooked to perfection. The galoti kebab was nice too. One suggestion in that. There is no need to give the small paratha with that. It is soaked in oil and i am pretty sure most of the people won't be eating it. The dal makhani was awesome. I had jain paneer butter masala and it was tasty. Crispy corn was good. The masala papas i did not like. The papad and masala was given seperately. I get the idea that it was given seperately so that you can put the amount of masala you want and also the papad won't become soggy. But the masala itself was not nice. But overall a good experience. I would recommend this place."
4.0,"Dhaba Estd 1986 Delhi is a dhaba themed Punjabi restaurant in Marathahalli. Located just below Foxtrot Gastropub, this place is well known for its dhaba style Punjabi cuisine.   Ambiance: A dhaba style ambiance with an open bar, live dessert counter, chat counter and parantha counter. They have a separate lounge for ala carte. There are pictures of Punjabi wrestlers, actors, some movie posters on the wall. They have a big LCD where they regularly play music and sports. There is always a live Gidda performance which is the main attraction of this restaurant.   I visited this place on a Friday afternoon with some of my friends.  Appetizers: Veg Momos, steamed momos marinated with spices and served with Green Chutney. It was good.  Tandoori Bhune Aloo was roasted baby potatoes, pressed, shallow fried and tossed with spices, onions, and saunth chutney. Loved it.  Veg Galouti were slow cooked vegetarian version of Galouti Kebab but the base parantha was overcooked and a bit hard. Tough to tear. Needs improvement.  Mushroom Hara Pyaaza were button mushrooms tossed with green spring onions. It was good.  Dhaba Paneer Tikka was one of the best paneer tikkas I have ever tried. The paneer was so soft and it was homemade so it brought great taste to this dish. I recommend this as a must here.   Drinks: Somras was a cocktail made in heaven A raw mango flavored cocktail which was really refreshing. I recommend it.  Gulaabo was a Kala khatta vodka-based cocktail which was good.  Virgin Mojito was good too.  Main Course: Amritsari Chhole cooked in Amritsari style. It had well balanced spicy taste and it goes well with kulcha and missa paratha.  Dal Dhaba was Dal Makhni in Dhaba style, which was thick, creamy and delicious. I recommended it.  Kanastari Baingan Bharta; baingan cooked in tandoor mashed and finished with tomato, ginger, cumin and green chili. Served best with Amritsari Kulche.   Amritsari Kulche were stuffed with paneer, pyaaz, aloo and mixed veg.   Dessert: Matka Kulfi: It was good.  The service was good, there was no delay in the service and the person who served us Mr. Asif was a very courteous man.   Overall, This place was worth visiting. This brand has won many accolades throughout India. I would say, this brought the dhaba culture to a new level. I would love to visit again to have some more of their delicious treats.

4.0,"We went to Dhaba Estd 1986 at Marathalli for Dinner with friends. The place is easily identifiable & right on the main road. It gives the feeling of the typical dhabas between Delhi Highways with a calm, relaxed approach with soothing flavors around you which makes you hungry. Especially with the fragrance of pure butter (white), makki ki roti & spices around.   We were game for it & tried various options till our stomach ache happened.   We had Khade Masale Ka Paneer Tikka which was very soft, well marinated & gave a burst of flavors. Veg Galouti was quite soft too with quite a handful of galouti's though we found the base to be little tight but was told it is served as authentic as in Delhi highways.  There was tandoori bhuna aloo which was quite colorful & came with a mix of alot of chutneys, Hara Bhara Kabab & Veg Manchurian which was found to be equally good.   Dhabe di roti, Missi tandoori paratha & Amritsari kulcha assorted basket make our evening great with the combination of a classic vegetable combination like Kanastari Baigan Bharta, Dal Makhani & Amritsari Chole.   In the desserts, we relished the Tilla Kulfi which is very rare to find in Bangalore & Rasmalai which was fresh & quite yummy. Also, don't forget their 11 varieties of lassi & signature cocktail mix which is newly launched & gives you a roller coaster ride to places.  In all, if you are in south & missing the north or you are from the south & need to get your hands dirty with stomach aching food, this is the place to be in. Highly recommended.                                             foodie.prorido.com"
1.0,I ordered dal makhani from this restaurant today and when i opened the packing i was shocked to see that the quantity was just one small katori.. i literally paid 279 for one dal makhani and that too for just one small katori.. please improve your quantity specially in packing.. dont ever order from here
4.0,"""Part of the secret of success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside"" -Mark Twain.  Originally, Dhabas were convention truck-stops for truck drivers on highways of Punjab and hence characterised by loud music, display of posters of famous Bollywood movies & actors, gimmicky glowlighs and tacky interiors to entice the truck drivers and served local, heavily spiced and fried Punjabi fare(just how we Punjabis like it!).  It is said that ""The dhaba moves wherever a Punjabi goes and unsurprisingly, the Dhaba culture has now become a trend across the nation.  I have grown up eating Punjabi food and this cuisine holds a special place in my heart. So naturally, I am always on a hunt for some traditional delicacies in Bangalore. When DHABA estd 1986 set their foot in my neighborhood I couldn't stop myself from paying a visit. Although the place offers a reasonably priced Buffet with a huge spread, we opted for A la carte.  Here are my personal favourites-                                           ...Read full post on thetravellinfork.wordpress.com"
4.0,"This was an accidental find on Zomato, while searching for a late night restaurant. However, a happy accident at that. Go here for the ambience, the courteous staff and the food, in that order.  They have paid a lot of attention to incorporate all the quirks and details of a north indian dhaba in their ambience. The bright colours, rusty lights, wooden furniture, film posters and other elements add a very authentic touch to the ambience.  The service and staff of this place is easily a standout amongst most of the places I have been to in Bangalore. They are courteous, quick, helpful and engaging. Would like to give a shout out to Asit and Bishnu for taking very good care of us.  The food also is delicious. We had ordered the Amritsari chhole, Pind waali dal tadka, lachha paratha and kulcha. The chhole were delectable and had a tangy, spicy taste. The dal was the typical yellow dal you would expect at a Punjabi dhaba and well made. Both the breads were soft, well cooked and hot when served.  In deserts, we ordered the Dhabe ka Meetha which was simply out of the world. It's a delightful combination of vanilla ice cream, gulab jamun, cake and bunch of other sweets which come together in a heavenly texture.  Would definitely recommend this place for a casual dinner with Bae or besties."
3.0,Too less quantity for a kheema dish worth 350
5.0,"As the place was not crowded we just got a table without reservation. Ambience: was happening with live music, staff dance,decor. Too good for a dhaba. Food:was delicious, so soft paneer, creamy dal dhaba, stuffed amritsaru kulcha. Price: is a bit over rated but compensated with the tasty of food and ambience."
4.5,"The dhaba 1986 have two outlets in Bengaluru one at Indira Nagar and another at marathalli. I had been to their marathalli outlet for a lunch. I was pretty curious about this restaurant since I had heard a lot about this restaurant, the dance performance by their crew and food.   The ambience of the restaurant is pretty much like the indoor version of the highway dhabas. The restaurant is lit bright. I loved their, shelves which were filled with lots of dhaba tiffins and their bar areas which was pretty much filled with lot of liquor bottles which added a local flavor. The seating arrangements are pretty good as well.  Service is excellent at the restaurant, our man of the hour was a person by named Asif. There was no any delay in the service. Mr Asif sure was a very courteous man and performed his duty well.   What I ate ??? Gulaboo  Gulaboo was the desi version of the cocktail which was available at the restaurant. It was the classic khalla ghatta which was mixed with the vodka and tasted amazing. I loved their container in which they bought the Gulaboo.   Amritsari macchi  The fish was fried well with the flour and it was accompanied by the ajwani seeds. The spices were perfect and the macchi tasted amazing.  Galouti kebabs  Wow!! It was the best among all the dishes I had tried. The mutton was minced very well and cooked with ghee. It was tender and tasted good. The only drawback I would say about the Galouti kebab was that the mini paratha which are used has the base was pretty hard and that was pretty annoying.   Mushroom hara pyaaza  The mushroom hara pyaaza tasted good. It was spicy and juicy as well. The gravy covered the mushrooms well as a result it provided the juicy content to it. There were fresh tomatoes and spring onions which accompanied the mushrooms.  Dhaba chilli paneer  The spices were mixed well with the paneer and it was cooked well. The gravy was pretty spicy and soothing.  Rarrha gosht  The mutton chunks were mixed well with the gravy which comprised of tomatoes, onions and other spices. The raarha gosht made the perfect combination along with the Amritsari kulccha.  Mutton sheekh kebab  The sheekh kebab is one of the classic non veg starters available. The well minced mutton meat is nicely roled into a cylindrical form and they tasted good.  All in all dhaba 1986 restaurant is a proven restaurant which has won a number of accolades pan India. It is a wonderful place which will definitely give you the glimpse of the dhaba culture. The restaurant is filled with a number of portraits on the desi sport ie ""kushti"". The ambience, service and food is top notch. One thing i regret is missing their music and dance. I seriously loved their cocktail bottle as well."
4.0,Very nice food . Good taste and sufficient quantity . Staff are polite and quick service too . Little overpriced but compensate with tasty food . Nice dhaba kind of ambience .
5.0,I gone for lunch. Its really awesome buffet. All starters are similar like north indian food. Taste is also good. Here you will get lots of vegetarians option also. You really gonna love this.
5.0,"We all know dhaba have a low key ambience but the food is yummy as ever. Well this Dhaba has got it all! The ambience, the food, the service and drinks. I had been here with a group of vegetarian friends so I had to spare myself from the meats. But of boy I wasn't disappointed with what we had ordered. We had the Panner taka tak, they had the right size of panner cubes.. Not too big like Shahi panner nor too small like a pea. We had taken veg momos too, fairly good.  For mains we ordered amritsari kulcha, dal makani and chole curry. Out of them all, dal makani stole the show. It was so creamy and cooked just right. If you already love dal makani, then get ready to fall in love again.  To top it off, rasamalai was a perfect ending to a good meal. We were so happy with the dishes we didn't mind paying the soaring bill amount they produced. I hope to visit here soon."
4.0,It is just near to the Innovative Multiplex and @home. Went for a get-together with colleagues. Somehing to highlight is for the flash mob performed by the staff.  Food : 4/5 Ambiance : 3.5/5. Because it was little smoky inside. May be because of live counter. Please take care @managemeent Service : 4/5  They had veg and non-veg starter 6 each. Good option for main course. Dessert are descent. Specially the kheer was awesome. Welcome drink was not compromised with quality.
4.0,Had been here for a lunch buffet. They have great variety and its such a change from the usual grills and barbeques. Also worth the money. The service was good too. Its purely Punjabi. They can definitely improve on the veg starters and the complimentary mocktails.
4.0,The curry was awesome and Biryani was also amazing. Naan was a little undercooked and a little expensive.
2.0,quantity is small compared to price. Taste of tawa chicken is avvg.
4.0,"Dhaba estd 1986 is a gem in North Indian cuisine in Bangalore and for sure it proves the authenticity and such a long lineage through its food. All your cravings for some delicious chicken or paneer will be fulfilled here.  *Ambience* The setup is full of Colors and quite quirky with all various Punjabi slangs all over. An open buffet is placed at one end of the place. The place can accommodate almost 120 people or so. The special 90s number playing add to the feels of the dhaba.  *Beverages* Tried quite some of the cocktails. All of them are desi counterparts of our normal cocktails. The recommended ones are : Gulabo- a Kala khatta drink Basanti - a vodka based drink  *Food* All the things you crave in a dhaba, you are sure to find it here :  Mutton Galauti Kebab - recommended One of the most mouth melting and delicious ones I have ever had, combined with the slightly crispy roti. This one is sure for a order.  Gobi Manchurian Made with lots of garlic and spice.  Chicken Tak A Tak Well marinated and has a slight tangy tinge to it, which I liked.  Amritsari Machhi - recommended A sure one to order if you love fish. Fish marinated, battered and then deep fried with slight flavours.  Paneer Tikka The paneer is fresh and soft and the flavours are intact.  In main course, we had their famous Dal Makhani with Dhabe di Roti. Dal Makhani - recommended North indians will feel nostalgic for sure after tasting this special delicacy. The dal makhani is thick and creamy and really loved it. One of the best I have had here. Combine it with plain naan or missi roti.  Balti Meat- recommended This is my second favourite dish here. So well made that the meat just breaks from the bone. It goes so well with their Dhabe di roti.  Assorted Breads Would recommend Dhabe di roti - whose flour is kneeded with eggs for great taste. Missi roti is quite decent and I personally loved it.  This is surely my favourite stop for some great North Indian cuisine. They even have a buffet option in the afternoon which is quite pocket friendly.  foodndestinations.com"
4.5,"Azure hospitality's flagship restaurant - Dhaba, has been my all time favorite in Delhi, as for all major family dining or celebrations, we headed to this fine restaurant for an authentic culinary experience. Their balti meat is my all time favorite. To my excitement, Dhaba has two similar outlets in Bangalore, both close to me. I got to try the Marthahalli branch, probably the biggest Dhaba branch I have come across so far, in terms of area. It's a vibrant space with authentic north Indian Dhaba style food, live counters to see your lentil dishes getting their tadka touch right in front of your eyes, lunch counters and dairy beverage counters. A projector screen is also in place, running Bollywood video songs or match screenings, if any.  AMBIENCE Vibrant decore with catchy captions and funny wall paintings. The captions are typical of all north Indian slangs used on highways and dhabas. The place is colorful, from seating to walls to even the bar counter, all done beautifully and not missing any shade. Seating is all couch and cushion base based, extremely comfortable and tables wooden. Overall the place a punjabi feel and sardar slang touchs are evident, made me feel very homely. The tiffin boxes and banta bottles added the very suburban touch.  Food and drinks  Started with a cocktail taster. It had various traditional street drinks, infused with vodka and/or tequila. My favorite one was Jal-Jeera one and kala khatta (gulaboo). Bloody mary and guava variants were also done pretty well. Really admired the way the names the drinks.  For starters we had - Paneer Tikka This is the most juicy paneer Tikka I have tried in a while. The marinating was still wet which really helped , the spices were sober yet tingling, the softness commendable and infusion of curd and other flavors within made it a great start.  Highway manchurian Why I personally admired this dish is because it rendered the right garlicky and chilli Manchurian flavor I got in small street restaurants and even wedding functions' starter trolleys in Delhi. I could relate with the flavor and advise people to try it. Bit toning down on chilli is however advisable.  Highway chicken tikka Not the authentic taste, but really good for a sober palate. Admired it for it softness and decent flavor.  Galouti kebab You ask me the best at Dhaba? Mutton galouti kebab it is. With infused flavor of Desi ghee in this nicely still spiced minced paste of mutton, and base of cripy parantha (notice crispy), this was my best pick from this place.  In mains- Dal makhni Dhaba is proud of its dal makhni and so are we. This is the best dal makhni I have had so far in Bangalore, and why not? It's a pan India place with Delhi roots and they surely have a knack for it. Cramy and buttery, medium consistency yet cooked so well that it easily disappeared after the light sips. Could have been a bit more spicy, for my northy spicy palate, otherwise a total delight.  Dhaba special mutton So this was so well cooked that the flesh was easily tearing apart from the bone, had flavors well infused within and a light delicious gravy to compliment it. Admired it.  Assorted breads Dhaba special roti had the sugary touch and very crispy feel, loves it. Missi roti was cooked in tandoor and was my favorite. Amritsari kulcha had filling of aloo, minced cauliflower, paneer and other spices and was decent.  Jeera rice  The jeera bites very crispy and rendered a strong flavor, rice was well cooked and not sticky. However a small ghee touch would have helped.  For dessert, we had Matka kulfi The Malai and coconut flavor were truly evident, a proper solid kulfi with pistachio on top. Absolutely loved it and would recommend this.  SERVICE and COSTING DHABA is a medium expensive place. Service is good and staff is well dressed. Manager is all time present and ensures a great time to all the customers.                                              instagram.com"
5.0,No no no no... There is no word which can help me to describe my happiness when I got to know about this place. The moment I had the food I felt like home. Authentic North Indian food in a typical Dhaba style and the amazing service by the staff was a delightful experience. This place is really awesome for everyone who is from North and is craving for the north delicacies this is surely the place which will satisfy your taste buds.

4.0,"Was craving for some authentic North Indian food and I was glad I decided to visit Dhaba on a Sunday afternoon.   What started as a hunt for the desi classics - butter chicken and naan ended on a very different high as we not only ate beyond our capacity in the buffet but also enjoyed a mesmerising live performance by Raqeeb...   Ambience - 5/5 (it transports you to north India with its interiors, decors and wall art)  Food - 3.5/5 (the desserts in buffet need some attention, nothing was as per expectations)  Value for money - 4/5 (we chose to have buffet, could be little higher for a la carte)   - Details of buffet menu -  * round of gol gappas: pani was very spicy and gol gappas were fresh but not like the authentic ones at a local shop  * dahi papdi: all the typical delhi flavours came back as we tasted it, loved it, nice and simple  * pao bhaji: another lovely item from the live counter, must try   * shikanji: one of the favourites, was served as the welcome drink, not very sweet, not to be skipped as this taste is not easily available in other restaurants  VEG * must try starters: matar ke kebab, bhuna aloo, crispy corn * other starters: mix veg bhajji, paneer tikka, malai ki sabziyan, chilli paneer   * main course:  I tried Palak paneer as it is my favourite and I must say it was even better than the chicken dishes!  Dal makhani was just about ok. One could also try aloo, dal dhaba and pulao.   NON-VEG  * must try starters: egg manchurian, chicken 65, chicken tikka * other starters: fish tikka, masala prawns, tandoori wings   * main course: Dhaba chicken curry was best in the non veg main course.  Biryani was cold and could have tasted more fresh.  Mutton curry was also good.  Other options were prawn curry and fish curry but I was too full to try.   DESSERTS:  It was very disappointing as I always look forward to this section the most.  Tried gulab jamun, moong daal halwa, kesari phirni, Cham Cham and nothing suited the Dhaba standards.  Even meetha paan was not available.   Overall a good experience but could have been great if the desserts tasted better.  With - Himanshu Talwar"

4.0,"Authentic Punjabi Food in Bangalore. Our team went for a dinner and each of us enjoyed the meal. Non veg platter is one of the best I've ever had. Whoever goes here, don't forget to have the Lassi."
1.0,Horrible food. The paneer makhni had 1/2 litre of oil and tasted only of garlic. Paranthas were burnt. Totally horrible!
3.0,rate is over priced as compare to quantity
4.0,"Very good punjabi food. We order all veg dishes and except the quality all things are really yummy. We have ordered 2 starters 3.5/5, 2 sabjis in main course both were yummy and they made enough spicy 4.5/5, also lassis were good. Over all I want to give 4.5 stars."
1.0,Ordered Paneer chilli and after receiving this I am very disappointed. Never order from this restaurant. They are making fool. Called them they said they prepare food like this. Worst restaurant. Again think before order. Snap attached.
4.0,"Good taste but when you pay 350 or more for a gravy, you expect a decent quantity."
5.0,"Lets get straight to the point Taste - Superrrrr so nice and no artificial colors Ambience - Authentic dhaba style of delhi but yeah could be more given a touch of khaat n all Tried out Alacarte. Bit on a pricey side but you get what you pay for. So i m greatly satisfied with the type of food, courteous staff, ambience and also the serving utensils."
3.0,"The food quantity is not according to what you pay and the taste was Okish too,not value for money"
4.0,"Been at the restaurant which is quite unique with tasty food, as I tried the vegetarian options I liked the variety available however I did feel the sweet options were too less for a price. I did like the way they give time for their food to prepare which we enjoyed the most while eating it. Food was properly cooked and served hot with request. Polite staff, wonderful service, loved being there."
1.0,"Went to Dhaba looking at the multiple positive reviews on Zomato and the overall rating. But, I must say, I was utterly disappointed.  First up, the food is way too overpriced - especially when even the quantity doesn't live up to the expectation. Secondly, the taste is all messed up - the flavours don't come out well enough and I couldn't figure out the flavours of the Balti Meat and Bhatina Chicken till the very end. The spices don't really strike a chord and fall short by a mile. Amritsari Paneer Kulcha, was well, just plain kulcha stuffed with maida.  Having lived in the North, I've had far better punjabi cuisine, and honestly, there are many small restaurants in Bangalore serving better and authentic punjabi food than this place. Don't think I'm ever stepping in here again!"
1.0,"worst food service, least amount of food delivered and burnt!!"
3.0,I visited the place on Sunday evening for dinner. Ambience wise the place is nice they play loud Punjabi music. But when is comes to food the taste was ok but I found it a bit expensive. They can surely work on the taste. Main course was 3/5. We ordered chicken and paratha. The desert was yummy . I can give 4.5/5 for rabri . Overall experience was ok ok 2.5/5. May be I had high expectations because so many people told me that it's a must visit
4.0,The food was delicious but didn't have any cutlery with food.. you should make sure you have kept cutlery with the food ordered..
1.0,Extremely loud for a North Indian place. Had to leave just after entering. You could nothing have a conversation with the person sitting beside you without shouting. Better go to a pub if that's what you're looking for.
2.0,Food quality not worth the money.
1.0,got only 3 sticks of achari soya chaap for 300 bucks. Really disappointed.
3.0,The food was no doubt exceptional good including the packaging. But the quantity was quite less in comparison to the price!
2.0,"Taste was okay but quantity was too less, according to price quantity is too less, restaurant should think about it. I have ordered butter chicken boneless and they have charged me 360rs but it only has 4 small pieces. which is not well enough for a single person."
5.0,Food was really good. NON Veg items were well cooked. All items were tasting as per their name :) Chicken kebab and Chicken pulao was excellent.  Nice exp keep going.
1.0,Very less quantity
4.0,"Bangalore on Fridays become the most lively or dull place ,depending on how you choose to spend it. So, one such weekend ,my friend and I decided to go for a movie and we wanted to have dinner before that. . Which made us look at some of the options in the vicinity. A year and a half back, Marathahalli didn't have much options except for a few which by now have already been tried and tested. . .but recently this area has seen a considerable number of new food outlets opening. . One such place is Dhaba. . Me and my friends had once decided to meet here for dinner but due to elections it was closed and we were hell bent on trying this place. A dhaba styled restaurant with a well lit bar and nice decor ,I love love such places . . Although I have had heard and read some mix reviews of this place but I wanted to give it a try. And I wasn't at all disappointed. . .  We ordered some cocktails which had a very impressive desi taste to it- Gulabo and Toofan,a chicken starter -Chicken Malai tikka (might be wrong with the name) and some regular rumali roti and chicken curry. And I must tell you,it was no less in taste than a highway dhaba with the flavours oozing out from the perfectly cooked,moist chicken.  I really enjoyed my visit , also courtesy Vasu Dixit and band's performance. The pricing is a bit on the higher side,if you order drinks but nothing that can't be afforded once a while for the sake of a happy weekend.  My ratings :  Food -  Decor /Ambience -  Service -  Price -"
4.0,"Everyone loveslong-drives and highways are full of surprises. It is so interesting to see the changing weather, people, and cuisines while moving along the road. Even the smallest dhaba on a highway has yummy food which makes our trip a memorable one. Keeping all this in mind, Dhaba Estd 1986 decided to bring out those nostalgic feeling live among their diners where they will be discussing and cherishing those amazing moments with their friends/family. Hence Dhaba Estd 1986, has launched a new menu which primarily focuses on National Highway delicacies. From a simple Daal Dhaba to flavorsome Kashmiri Dum Aloo to spicy Laal Maas, Mutton Rogan Josh to soul-soothing Papad Ki Sabzi and whatever else you get in a highway dhaba is now available at all the outlets of Dhaba Estd 1986. Read through the blog and am sure you will skip your long drive once and try this.                                                                 ...Read full post on thecrumbstashdeepa.blogspot.com"
5.0,First impression: The greeting and guidance to the table was pleasant.  Food: I chose to go for the lunch buffet. The starters were served to the table and they were very good with all of them being medium spicy and the flavour was also very proportional. The main course had the authentic punjabi dishes like the Adraki Mutton and Green dal curry which were excellent.  Dessert: I have never seen such a variety of Indian desserts at one place else where. They were awesome!  Verdict: Great value for money and good experience altogether!!
1.0,Don't go with the rating for this place. Staff force the people to give them rating when they visit. So it's quite obvious just to make them feel good you end up going 5. I've seen this and telling from my personal experience. We had been for corporate dinner with my team and to be frank the food options were very limited and they had only 1-2 starters in non veg and that too they were not worth it. Overall our team was not happy and we were eager to leave this place asap. And yes we left the place without having the deserts as they dint serve us the deserts well in time. So service wise as well there is no chance to rate them or give them an extra *
2.0,Quantity is very low
4.0,"This place is good and has dhaba style ambience. Loved this place not just coz of the food but more because of the live music performance by the band called the acoustics. Singers voice is was mesmerising and they were playing all unplugged Bollywood songs. Was totally enjoying the night and was dwelled into the music.  Coming to the food menu, do try their dal dhaba, sweet lassi, Kala Khatta and matka kulfi.  Must visit it at least once."
4.0,"North Indian Dhaba Style Food : This could be the apt single line description for this place.  I really liked the food here , I have tried veg galowati , Chilli Paneer , Butter Chicken and Rotis were good too.. The Flavours are very close to the food available in Dhabas in North.  Only thing that is not Dhaba like is the pricing. Prices are a little too high here.  Buffet option is also available which is really worth trying.   One time we also got the food delivered , the service was fast and packing was awesome.  Ambience is also kept that goes with the theme.  Quality place and recommended."
2.0,"We booked this place for our 16 members team after checking the reviews in Zomato which was 4. 1 stars, but to our disappointment we did not find the place to be of 4 stars. Good things about the restaurant: - Location is good. - Ambience tried to get a look of dhaba 2.5 star. - Staffs are courteous. - Only one starter was good 3 stars for that. - Deserts were good. Especially jalebi. - Main course was not upto the mark.  Things that can be improved - Don't place the bottled before the guest arrives. After opening it they will come and say Sir it is chargeable 100. - Starters are served late and they will try to fill you by giving chats, pani poori. Non veg will come late and in limited quantity. - Corn fry, mutton keema kabab was really bad. It was chewe and taste more like garam masala. - The item chicken wings tandoor kabab was good but was served once. On repeated requested also it was never served. - Mutton curry was different when we tried 2nd time. Pieces were big and was not cut for the curry dish. Huge bone pieces. - Malabar fish curry was a big flop. - Staff will not say anything about the price for extra mocktail that they will be serving. When the bill came it was 249 for a simple masala soda. Please ask for the price whenever they serve anything extra. This is first and last time at The Dhaba. I could have given 2.5 stars but the option is not available."
4.0,good food...but cold on arrival.
5.0,awsome
4.0,Nice authentic tasting North Indian food... Good ambience of dhaba theme.. service was good too. Had veg food only this time and it was very tasty
2.0,"The only good thing about this place was its friendly staff and pretty good ambience. Items are hugely overpriced at this place. Most of the veg dishes and starters were in the 300 - 350's and most of the non veg dishes were in the 400 - 450's. After paying such a price you expect something extraordinary, but the taste of food was just like you can get at any ordinary restaurant. Nothing special in the taste department. And the quantity was also very less for the price. Alcohol was also expensive here. I think this restaurant is in a dream world, where they would charge anything and guests would happily pay for that, but thats not the case. I would never go to this place and never recommend anyone to go here. Just a small suggestion.....its still not late, you have to slash your prices down atleast by 100 rupees, and increase the quality of food. Otherwise there are many good restaurants in the vicinity. I can see this restaurant closing very soon if they continue to do this."
2.0,The food taste is good. But I dont understand why the drinks are so highly priced. A dal makhani is 325 whereas a sweet lassi is 250. Dont really understand the basis of pricing. Food rating might be a 4 but coz of price Im rating it a 2 overall.
4.0,"Superb food!! Simply awesome! I guess I had the best North Indian food here.   Rocommendations:  dhaba di roti, news lassi, sole tandoori fish and Balti meat. This all we ordered and loved every bite of it!!"
3.0,"quantity on delivery orders is lesser compared to when you dine in Overall, great food and excellent ambience The music was way too loud when I had visited the restaurant though"
2.0,"pathetic food..dont know why it is rated as 4.1..i ll rate 2 based on the food taste , quality and the overpriced menu"
5.0,awsome
3.0,The quantity has reduced...we used to order food regularly from dhaba.The taste of the food is good but cant cheat customers by reducing the quantity.
3.0,Too much oil 3.5 for the properly cooked chicken
3.0,"I did not understand why the prices are too high at this place for food and drinks both. Ambiance is fine, not great. Food taste, quality and quantity is just normal not great, so did not understand the cost difference. Still place was crowded on weekend. Service is good. Could see variety in food menu here. Overall average in all."
4.0,I have ordered a couple of times from this place. It's little on the higher side in terms of pricing but still have it a shot...  The food has been very good and good packing. Proper north style roomali rotis to enjoy with kebabs...  Tawa items are the best. I loved their tawa kebabs and tawa aloo. Must try.  Quantity can be a little more as per the price you pay.  One of the best places so far especially for North India cuisines...
3.0,Quantity less than how much we got served at the restaurant
5.0,awesome
5.0,"Very decent place.. good for all types of people, family, friends, etc. A1 staff and live music is best.. typical North Indian taste... must visit..."
5.0,A great place to have an authentic Food of Punjab with a great Punjabi Ambience n Environment. The food is not so spicy and delicious. Been here 3-4 times.
5.0,"Dhaba offers one of the best Punjabi foods in Bangalore. The taste is authentic and service is pretty decent. There is option of Buffet and Ala Carte. Valet Parking is available. The place is very lively, huge sitting place and Vibrant interiors."
2.0,Quantity is abysmal. 329 plus taxes for a plate of sheek kebabs and all we get is 3 pieces. All containers have an empty compartment. tandoori chicken is half (4 pieces). Not ordering again. Total ripoff. Was good in the beginning but with more business I guess theyre turning stingy with their portions. Beware!!!
5.0,always felt good to order from Dhaba...
4.0,Rice Quantity is little and curry has lot of oil
4.0,"Been here for the tandoori kababs specially. Good menu with lovely taste and aroma of North Indian cooking. Although been a hard core non-vegetarian, loved the veggies on offer. Surely would try again in future."
5.0,awesome
3.0,You may like this place if you are up for some north Indian dhabha kind of food. The staff is pretty attentive and put up a show for you during the event.
5.0,food was good
5.0,"Had the lunch buffet here.  The ambience is colorful and bright. It's a good place to click pictures. The service is good and the staff performed a little dance which was enjoyable to watch. Coming to the food, the veg starters were limited compared to the non veg starters. Starters included panipuri, papdi Chaat, crispy corn, tandoori aalu (this wasn't good), Gobi Manchurian, chicken wings, fish Tikka, tandoori chicken, chicken kabab, etc. Like most buffet places, you can fill up on starters as there isn't much to be expected from the main course. Main course included chicken biryani, and curries containing mutton, soya, paneer and chicken. The desserts again are really nice. Desserts included gulab jamun, jalebi, gulaabi kheer, lauki Halwa, ice cream and kalakand. The gulab jamun is highly recommended"
4.0,"Must Order Food Dishes/Drinks:  - Tandoori Momos - Manchurian with a Punjabi twist - Chowmein - Shikanji - Rasmalai  Overall  4/5 Food  4/5 Drinks  4/5 Service  3.5/5 Ambiance  4/5  Our Experience   After visiting Dhaba 1969 for multiple times, this time we decided to try out their newly launched NH8 menu. Chef Ravi aims to bring together different regional cuisines of India in a single place. The menu largely covers food dishes from states like Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat & North East India.  We started our food journey by ordering Manchurian and Tandoori Momos. Both tasted brilliant. While the Manchurian was prepared with Punjabi masala, the momos were lip smacking & reminded me street side momos stall of Delhi. More portions were ordered multiple times.  In drinks we had Choti Glassiyan  Mini version of 6 mocktails - Jaljeera, Aam Panna, Shikanji, Kala Khatta, Ganne ka sa Ras and Rangeela. Absoluetly loved the jaljeera & kala khatta.  For the mains, we had chowmein  a typical Indianized version of Hakka noodles. It was loaded with your regular veggies and was quite appetizing. Other things ordered were shudh-shakahari papd ki sabji & Kashmiri dum aloo. Papad ki sabji was very spicy (can be avoided here). The aloo was prepared with utmost love.  To end our main course, we had rasmalai & rasgulla. Both were equally good & cherished by all. Dhaba surely leaves you with memories of good food & service experience.  I am sure they are on the right path of becoming a national highway diner with the same old Punjabi dildaari."
5.0,"What taste! Ultimate Punjabi/ North Indian taste. Loved their dal makhni, galouti. A bit heavy on pocket but for a special North Indian dinner this is the place."
5.0,"India is known for its diverse culture and cuisines. The regional flavors and cuisine changes with every 50 Km. From Kanyakumari to Kashmir NH (National Highway) connects people and food plays a key role when it comes to NH. Dhaba celebrates this hot and sweet Khazaana of India by introducing Dhabas National Highway Maharaajs of Indian menu. From Punjabs favorite Tangdis to Rajasthani favorite Laal maas and Papad ki Sabzi and Gatta curry; from sweet Gujarati Daal to Kashmirs favorite Rogan Josh and Dum Aloo, they have carefully created this NHMI menu for serious food lovers. They have also clubbed Eastern Indias favorite fish recipes and also the popular Chinjabi (Chinese + Punjabi) dishes like Tandoori Chicken Momos and Manchurians with that spicy desi twist. This was my first visit to Marathahalli outlet and as always this time also I was very much impressed with their vibrant interiors, and funny posters with catchy captions. The staffs are very polite and helpful. If you are lucky, you will see them grooving with some desi beats.   This times experience was completely different from my last visit to Indiranagar outlet where I indulged in posh Paneer tikkas, Tandoori Raan and Dal Makhani. The new NHMI menu is simple and short. We tried almost everything from the menu and what I really loved is the Chinjaabi Manchurian (Chicken), Tandoori Veg Momos, Baingan Bhaja, and Chicken Chowmein. For heavy belting, we ordered some desi favorites like Gulmargi Rogan Josh, Dum Aloo Kashmiri, Jaipuri Papad ki Sabzi and fiery Laal maas, and Bangla special Macher Jhol along with hot Roti/Naans and plain rice. Whatever the menu is, a South Indians meal is incomplete without some piping hot rice. With only two options for desserts, its either this or that situation and we tried the Bangla special Rosogolla and Chenna Payesh. With the right amount of sweet quotient, both the desserts were exceptionally good. For Dhaaru shaaru (alcohol), you have to order from their regular menu. After trying some samples I opted for my favorite Aam Panna drink  Som Ras which was served on a vintage style Goli Soda bottle. Their sweet lassi is also a must-try.  Overall I liked the NHMI menu and my experience at Dhaba Marathahalli outlet. I would definitely go back soon to savor some of my favorites.                                             yougottatryit.in"
2.0,"Food: 2/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 4.5/5 VFM: 1.5/5  I happened to visit this place a couple of weeks back and I was surprised to see how the well advertised and talked of restaurant couldn't do the thing that it was supposed to do the best: Serve good food! The ambiance is proper, the servers are impressive but after all one goes to a restaurant for food.  For starters we had ordered:  1. Murgh Malai Tikka 2. Achari Paneer Tikka Now both of these were decent, nothing exceptional really but definitely not like the authentic Delhi/Punjab style of cooking - which makes the pieces succulent and soft. 3. Gurda Kaleji - This was strange! Like I grew up eating this and I'm a Delhite. I know for a reason that it doesn't taste the way these guys made it. The only good thing that happened with this dish was they accepted it back on our complaint.  Main Course was even worse: 1. Kadhai Paneer 2. Butter Chicken 1986 Both of these were strange. Especially for the price on the menu you can't serve a watery Butter Chicken which just doesn't taste like Butter Chicken. Kadhai Paneer was no good.  They have quite a few beverages, one is a combo of 6 non alcoholic drinks served on a toy cart. Some of the drinks were good but this again was more of an Insta friendly dish rather than a taste friendly one.  The desserts were better thankfully, Phirnee was good but again way too pricey.  Disappointing experience - especially when you expect something decent from the hypes that had been created."
5.0,Very courteous staff. Great quality food..Balti Meat is amazing and so is their chicken..Nice Ambience which gives you the feel of a dhabha..... Overall a great experience
5.0,Lovely place to spend time and enjoy quality food. Staff was really polite and helpful. Best Dal Makhni (Dal Dhaba) ever had in my life. Must try. Good variety of punjabi food and nice combination of drinks.

5.0,"Food quality, presentation and taste is miles ahead compared to any other restaurants but pricy."
2.0,"With so many positive reviews the restaurant had set some expectations but we were extremely disappointed with service. We opted fr weekend buffet lunch veg option. Water, mocktail, starters everything was being served only when asked for, plates were not cleared, etc. Starters were tasty and menu selection was also good. But desserts and main course nothing worth mentioning. Malpua was not at all good, vanilla ice cream was I suppose the best dessert. We went in a group of 7 with 3 kids below 6 and had called in advance to confirm kids were not charged but at time of bill manager said one kid will be charged which I felt was not very professional. All in all bcoz of bad inattentive service spoiled the experience and food also could not make up for it."

3.0,too much oily
4.0,"Nice place for a buffet. Nice setting like dhaba, though you would miss the khatiyas. Coming to food, pretty decent food even for vegetarians. They have got a pretty nice and widespread set of starters to fill up your tummy. Deserts were also good.To add up to everything, the ghazal singer adds up to the flavor with his soulful voice."
5.0,"Been to this place on sunday night with my family for dinner. Food and service both were great. We ordered non veg platter , paneer and chicken butter masala. Funny Quotes written on walls. Ambience also very nice."
4.0,We ordered in on a Saturday night. This place is my go to place for authentic North Indian food. The mutton do pyaza and tandoori chicken was amazing!! The naan and rumali roti could have been better. But over all I give a huge thumbs up! Food: 5 Value for money: 4
1.0,you guys delivered paneer when I ordered chicken .. ridiculous..I hope I don't have to order again from dhaba.
4.0,"I have been to its Indiranagar branch and was expecting the same quality in the Marathalli branch. I have opted for buffet as the items were quite big in numbers. I wasn't so impressed with the dry items of chicken as it was lacking the spiciness which I was expecting. The mocktail was amazing and well presented. You have loads of varieties in the main course and desserts. Both of them were highly impressive and I relished them fully. Lastly, the VFM is also justified. Please do work on your chicken starters, can be much better."
4.0,lived to expectation as always..
3.5,"Been to this place twice now.. This review is about my second visit but may have a carry over affect of +0.5 rating points from my previous visit.  Ordered non veg buffet, rating for the food is as follows   1. Non veg starters : 3/5. 2. Main course : 2/5. 3. Deserts : 3/5.  Service : average at best..2.5/5, servers should concentrate on serving food instead of doing bhangra to loud Punjabi music...please stop doing that.  Ambience : good. 3.5/5  To dhaba : please improve your buffet food quality...it's nowhere close to quality of food with  la carte order and please stop the bhangra!!!"
3.5,Good ambience and service. I had buffet. Limited options in main course and desserts. Only 2-3 varieties in desserts.But taste was good. Worth a try.
4.0,This place has a nice ambience. The waiters are quite polite and friendly. We had gone for the buffet. If you are a foodie and can eat a lot then the buffet is worth it. Quite delicious dishes.

5.0,GOOD
4.0,"My longing for North Indian food dragged my feet here for lunch. The decor is vibrant with some really funky Punjabi tunes being played. The attendants were very cheerful, attentive, full of energy and served food with a big smile.   The chicken and fish starters were very succulent and juicy. However the veg version of Galouti kebab did impress me but when dipped with mint chutney. Mains were decent. After the starters it was the desserts that impressed me. The Rabri was... Oh! so good. So generous of them to give us a complimentary dessert which they recently introduced in their menu.  In my opinion it is a very good place to have a happy and fulfilling tummy. Do check this place out."
4.0,"Location: Easy to find, have valet parking. Ambience: Good. Theme is of punjabi dhaba Service: Awesome Food: Good. Mawa Lassi is the best. Started with complimentary drink as shikanji, jaljira paani, lime juice. Good tasty starters and main course. Deserts are limited but taste is good.  Overall: A good place to visit and eat tasty north indian food. I'll recommend this place"

4.0,"Visited the outlet in Marathalli for lunch in Monday. The interiors are colorful with lot of quirky quotes and mud vessels that give u the dhaba feel. There is enuf seating space for team.lunches and big families. We decided to go with the buffet since it had a pretty decent spread. The starters had chicken, fish and veg items like mushrooms, potatoes and chat items. The main course felt a bit limited but still good enough. Deserts had phirni, gulab jamun, cham cham, ice cream. The service was friendly and swift. Overall: Food - 4/5 Ambience - 4/5 Staff - 4/5 Vfm - 4/5"
5.0,"When you want to have a good dal makhani there are plenty of options in town however if you are looking for the best and the real Dal Makhani, Dhaba is the place to be. I was told a la carte is a bit expensive but to me it was totally worth every penny. An absolute fun decor, impeccable service with smiling staff walking around to ensure you get a VVIP treatment.  Creamy Dal Makhani with packed desi flavours are gonna stay with you for long. Palak paneer with the lasuni overtone was a power-packed punch.  The impromptu flash mob elevated the fun experience. 5/5 on all the parameters. Thanks Neel for showing us this gem. Coming back for more with friends real soon."
5.0,ordered butter chicken and naan. taste is awesome but the quantity of butter chicken is very less for its price..
2.0,for the money the quantity is too less for 2 person

1.0,the food was all spilled inside the zomato bag. i paid more than 3400 and half of the food was not in edible condition. shockingly pathetic.
4.5,Best North Indian buffet in town! It was the first visit and I am sure I will come back again soon. Keep up the quality. Must must visit for all the foodies out there!!
3.0,Food was very oily and not worth the price they have charged.
3.5,"We'd been here a couple of times for office luncheons.  The ambience was impressive at first sight - although there's so much going on that you can't really take it all in one visit. The place gives a rustic yet bright feel of a Dhabha and the Punjabi flavors, in general. There are several humorous bites written on walls, which I've seen in several similar restaurants but I can't seem to get enough. They did make some changes to the decor in between the times I've visited.  It's always great to try out platters in such places where you can't seem to decide on what to start off with.  From the platter, I enjoyed the Palak Paneer Seekh and the Soy Chaap. My favorite pick was their Chili Paneer. The Paneer was soft and not rubbery like many other places; the chili quotient was really high just the way I like it. My colleagues ordered the Macchi Tikka and the Mutton Seekh Kebab. They weren't impressed with the Mutton but thoroughly devoured in the fish.   For the mains, we had the Chicken Biryani, Mushroom Hara Pyaaz with Missi Paratha (which probably is a strange combination but I loved it). The Biryani wasn't all that great but Mushroom was spicy and filled with great flavors.  Wasn't excited with the selection of desserts, but that' just me therefore, I passed.  The service was acceptable.                                             foodloverspark.com"

4.5,"The worthy descendent oflegendary Dhaba that was once inside the famed Claridges hotel in Luytens Delhi ,Dhaba Estd 1986 has made a mark for the the rustic street highway style north Indian cuisine in last few years. Loud , bright and full of colours , reminding me rustic somewhat rural and with lot of art elements like that would bemuse the truckwallahs (the highway truck drivers) , and loads of filmy old posters and dialogues from the bollywood blockbusters on the walls. Some crazy looking nalka chandeliers, nimbu-mirchi lights etc make this place uniquely interesting.The loud Bollywood item numbers will definitely make your foot tap during your dining here.                                                                 ...Read full post on thefoodietales.com"
2.0,too much oil and food wasn't as good as on previous orders
5.0,Ordered dal makhani and chicken tawa dish along with Indian breads. I am from Lucknow where you get some amazing food but the dal makhani here was so good that I could not even remember the last time I had something as tasty as this. I mean I can still feel the taste although the dish got over 3 days ago. That's how much I loved it. Chicken dish was also good and so were the breads. Hope they maintain the taste and quality and special kudos to the Chef
4.0,funky. colourful. vibrant ambience place is neat. spotless cutlery.  Impressive VFM Buffet. focus on taste over the number of dishes. Short yet sweet dessert assortment. Must Visit. Recommended..!
5.0,"Place is very happening, ambiance is superb , food is super awesome. One should visit to place for mind refreshments. Staffs are super cool and friendly. Cool live music. Staffs dance performance.   I give this place 5 star."
4.0,"Great food & ambience. Desserts and sides are heavy on pockets!!  Have been here for a treat from colleagues. The first attraction here is the funky wall paints and the ambience with all yellow lighting. Culnery & Crockery used here gives you an authentic feel.  Being a vegetarian I had Khade Masala Paneer Tikka and Bhune Aloo. Especially the paneer was so tender and soft which is one of the best I had till date. Handi biryani is like pulao and pricing of rotis isn't fair. Butter milk and Lassi are must try. Dhaba spl 4 layered dessert, Dhabe di Meeta is too good but way too overpriced for the quantity.  Overall it's a place that you shouldn't miss  Ambience - 5/5 Cost to quality - 4/5 Taste - 4/5 Service - 4/5 (bit slow)"
4.0,I ordered paneer but got kadhai mushroom instead. 1 less star for changing the order without asking customer. Hope it never repeats in future.
5.0,awesome
2.0,too much of oil. maida rotis. watery raita. too expensive considering the sub-standard taste
3.0,"Ambience - They play very very loud music. The songs are good, but this is not a pub. People go to restaurants to have a nice chat with their loved ones. Loud music is a mood killer.  Food is amazing though. Dal makhni is heaven. Their veg buffet is extremely delicious. Even small and simple items like peas pulav was very tasty. Desserts were too sweet and filling."
3.5,"We went for a team lunch for buffet. The food was good, but it could have had more options for vegetarians, like paneer, gobhi and aloo in starters. The complimentary drink was not so good. The main course and dessert was good, but not so great. But the staff were very friendly, and they started dancing for some punjabi dance numbers. Overall it was a good experience."
3.0,"Let me start with the positives- the ambience of the place is really good, does justice to its name. It has the dhaba feel, food is served in steel plates, which is good as well. Service is decent as well. However, food was very average. We had ordered chicken kukkad, naan and chicken taka tak. Taste was very average, quantity was less, but was highly priced. We ordered lassi which was just ok.   They should either improve their quality and quantity or definitely revise their prices. Overall, not a place i would want to go back to."
4.0,"I have now been here around 5 times and the dishes they serve are delicious ... staff is very helpful ... environment is energetic and they take care of everything you need...  their palak paneer, dal takda are awesome ... but however I feel that price is bit on a high side . it's approx 1500-2000 for 2 persons which is in high range ... otherwise it's good place to hangout ... that's why even after being in high side I am tempted to eat there when ever I come to Bangalore ."
1.0,delivery guy has given wrong order
4.0,Finally a good North Indian joint #marathalli. From ambience to food to decor it represented Dhaba to the core. Loved the hospitality as well as the food. We went for lunch buffet and it was really great. The staffs were courtesious.  If the spices on starters were bit less then it would have been totally awesome.  Coming to the prices if it had been bit on the lower side then this can be visited regularly... otherwise it's a must #goto restaurant @marathalli
2.0,"We are a team of 45 people visited this restaurant for a treat and the overall experience was a disaster. The service is horrible, food taste was average. Mocktails were pathetic. The varieties were different from what was told during booking and only a few starters servedRpeatedly we informed them to serve starters but was of waste of our time and effort."
1.0,"Encouraged by their kickass butter chicken I ordered Baalti Meat, baingan bharta. The food was very mediocre. The quantity of the Butter chicken was far more generous than the Balti Meat. The quality of packing was also different. I guess I will order only butter chicken from here in future. Sad."
3.0,"After reading so many positive reviews about this place, I thought to order for home delivery.  Food I ordered :  Malai Kofta : It was nice but since when the malai kofta is spicy......the dish has more of spicy side here whay I got which should not be the case otherwise.  Lacha Paratha : Hot paratha which were good and well prepared.  Must say the delivery packing was just awesome....i guess the amount charged is for that only.  The Only thing i would request is its very very hard to open the food boxes."
3.0,"This post is a detailed review for veg ala carte night menu at DHABA ESTD 1986 Marathahalli. They have another branch at Indiranagar too.  I went for dinner thinking its a buffet, but they have recently stopped it. Its just an ala carte menu during night.  Must try food: Galauti Kebab, veg sheek kebab Must try drinks: shikanji and Lassi  Unlimited beer and starters offer is available for this IPL season.  My ratings for this place will be:  Food:3/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5"
5.0,I finally found a place in Bangalore that makes butter chicken exactly like how I used to have in Delhi. and they are quite generous with their portions too! Hope with time the quality continues to be excellent!
5.0,Ordered Daal Dhaba and Chilli Paneer. Both were very tasty.
1.0,"went to this place last sunday after reading so many wonderful reviews with 3 other people. It was me who suggested this place to them and it was such a embarrassing situation when the food was so bad. starting with the starters...they were very oily, paneer tikka was more of fried then grilled, fish and prawns had raw smell, no doubt pav bhaji was very good but that was the only thing worth eating. main course was also very disappointing and desert was the only respite as gulab jamun and rabri were good.all of us came out hungry and had to eat something else after the buffet. we informed this to the waiter and manager too , they were humble but took no action. I would not recommend this place to anyone else ever."
1.0,"Well I gave negative rating out of my dissatisfaction with them. They are over rated I must say. Ambience is good and inside the room theres live music which was really good. Coming to food part they are average, we took non veg buffet but now I am going to write the circumstance which made me to write against their hospitality. Along with our non veg buffet I ordered a ThumpsUp, they served it in 300ml CAN along with a glass and one pc of ice in it. The MRP written on the CAN is Rs.35 which we all know right, but they charged Rs.150 for it, while I asked about it they replied because of the service they charged that much. My question is, do you all think its at all justified? Rs.35 can be claimed double which is Rs.70 but claiming 4 times higher price is not at all justified. After all its just a restaurant but not a 5 star hotel right? So think twice before you visit that place. After all we are customers and we are paying our hard earned money to these restaurants in some weekends to celebrate with our family but if we get this kind of shock do you think we can really enjoy??"
3.0,"Food is good, but everything on menu is overpriced.. glass of sweet lassi 230/- coke 150/-.. only one time visit... prices are like five star hotel.. not worth for money.."
1.0,"Bad experience..Sunday night we decided to go for the dinner to Dhabha, We ordered starters it was ok, then we ordered chicken gravy which was pathetic, running gravy bad taste ,even we prepare better than this at home, overpriced as well.The. we ordered Rara Mutton,where mutton was not cooked at all,when we raised their issue to manager he argued with us and said it is cooked. We decided to leave and pay bill and go because manager was not at all cooperative and was trying to defend , we asked for the bill it was around Rs 1998 , then we asked one of the waiter to call the chef ,he will let us know whether it was cooked or not,then finally chef came and accepted that it was not properly cooked but manager disappeared and didn't came back. I don't know what of manager he is not at all ready to accept the customer feedback instead argued and made us pay the full bill without having anything."
3.0,Good Food but not great . Live music - which was good again but the stock music was too loud. The waiters were too eager to get way with utensils which I didnt find to be polite . At some point there was a short performance from the waiters but seems they were forced to do so. absolute woeful.  overall Food - 3 ambience- 3 music - 2 courtesy - 2
4.5,"Must visit restaurant, in Marathahalli, if you are interested in North Indian/Punjabi cuisine!  Pros : - Nice ambiance, very hospitable and well groomed staff and the best part food......... We ordered : - 1. Machi Tikka.....spicy starter, seemed very well marinated 2. Sweet Lassi... perfect quantity and not too much sweet 3. Balti Meat..........the dish to go for. Mutton was very soft and well cooked, with a perfect blend of spices and right quantity of curry 4. Tandoori roti and Pudina Paratha were well baked  Cons : - Nothing as such. Reduction of ghee in Pudina paratha and Balti Meat can attract fitness freaks... Anyways taste greedy freaks go anywhere!  Thanks Neha Srivastava (@nawabitaste)"
5.0,"""W ar Pujabi ~ p Clm m ni Hnd"" I have been many pubs, clubs, bar, Casual dinning, restaurant and many more, but ""Dhaba Estd 1986 Delhi"" is Exceptionally Best Casual Dinning and Bar I ever visited and it is a place where you get proper North Indian food to be very precise ""Proper Pujabi Khanna peena"". What do you expect about Ambience! Full Punjabi songs, enjoy your food with music, you will feel like you are literally sitting in an Amritsari Dhaba because the concept of the restaurant is totally based on Punjabi Dhaba , And if I talk about service, first class, one more thing I want to highlight is, when you enter in this casual dining after giving order of the food and drink, they will first serve you a plate of onion and lemon, which all most every Punjabi would love. And Menu is very attractive and it is quite big. Food is worth the money, Amritsari Chole with Kulche and Rumali Roti, I loved it. There is a ""tehka"", which serves every alcohol. I feel this is the only place, where I get my kind of food in whole Bangalore till now. And I will rate beyond 5 star because of the Food, Service, Ambience and one more unique thing i.e. whole dining is covered with different Quotes written on walls in Punjabi. I won't mind going there again. Must Visit at least once. (Mandatory for Punjabi's)"
4.0,"Located on 3rd floor typical punjabi north Indian restaurant is a must visit for Punjabi & North Indian food. Loved their paneed dhaba, daal dhaba (makhni) and superb service. Staff is friendly and respectful. Decent ambiance. They add upfront service charge ~10% which should be asked before adding, hence deducted 1 star. Rest it was good experience in Bangalore. Highly recommended."
4.0,I had the best punjabi food in Bangalore. Curries have the traditional homely flavour with must have spices in place. Quantity is good enough to enjoy. Tried few coolers and they were nice. The only challenge we faced was a terribly slow service. Deducted 1 star for it. I would prefer to order at home in future rather than dining in for the taste.
3.0,"explore the Punjabi cuisine by visiting the Dhaba....very rich food. Great job  on the ambience, music is a lil too loud... it gets difficult to have a conversation or to hear the items served by the staff. Typical starters as any other buffet place... one addition is the cauliflower... which is not very good. The  biryani is good compared to any other  buffet... so good job on that... even the mutton was decent.  Deserts are limited to Indian and thats just amazing  the sweets  were a perfect balance of sweetness... number of items are less but its all worth having.... sweets where the highlight. Lastly they have a chat and bread counter... did not try any of the breads. But chats where  yummy   P.S. ask for the chats as they are not served. My rating for the place would be a 3.5 as there much better buffet options."
1.0,"average food, alacarte extremely costly...for the same buffet price there are many gud restaurant near by. ...ambience is OK ....only best part is live music which is gud ..."
1.0,Special thanks to Zomato as your reviews ruined my birthday party. The service was horrible and they gave only 1 potato and paneer in veg buffet.
4.5,"Born and brought up in Delhi, I'm a sucker for Punjabi food, and Dhaba serves one of the best in town. Been here a couple of times.. the first time for Lunch, and then for an all you can eat and drink event that happened recently! The food was equally good both times. Really liked the Tandoori Bhune Aloo and Galouti Kebab and fish tikka among starters.. Galouti kebabs and fish tikka are simply melt in your mouth! And the Dal is the creamties and the best! You could just go there for the Dal and finish your meal with it :) The mutton dishes too are delish. If you are looking to relish on some rich tasting punjabi food accompanied with great hospitality, head to Dhaba.. :)"
5.0,awsome
4.0,"Ok, before I start, let me confess..being a north indian and a foodie, authentic dhaba food for me has always been that elusive dream in Bangalore. Dhaba the restaurant have probably made that dream a little more realistic. The service here is courteous, the ambiance fun and the food absolutely lip smacking. Went in on a saturday night with my fiancee who's also a foodie like me (touchwood!!) and was absolutely in love with the music and food on offer. Liked their quirky twist of the menu and the bar counter. Had butter chicken which was delicious along with rotis which were soft and well made. The drinks menu or thekka as they call it was complete with liquors, cocktails and other options for non drinkers. The pricing well, is a little on the steeper side with a lime soda costing around INR 145... however, not complaining because maybe good old Punjabi dhaba styled food in Bangalore comes with a price. Overall, a good place to enjoy with friends or family. Planning a visit soon on a Friday this time to check on live music!!"
5.0,"Colorful ambiance with delicious food. That too we liked the array of mocktails, laassi was done to the perfection. Lamb was cooked as the meat falls from the bone, roti were soft and crispy. Service was too good. Perfect for parties. They also have buffet for both veg and non-veg. Highly recommended place in Outer Ring Road.                                                                  madraasi.com"
4.5,"Looking for some lip smacking punjabi food served with some swag then this is your go to place in Marathahalli. Loved the bright blue, yellow, red green colours which are used to add that vibe to the ambiance. It sure is a beautiful setting & makes your meal fun & memorable.   They have some very indian inspired drinks . Drinks with a twist of Kala Khatta, Aam Panna, jal jeera etc. on their menu.   The menu is vast & the foodie in you will love what you get. The food is visually appealing & it doesnt stop there like many other restaurants, the food is great tasting as well, some of the best marinated, soft, tender & succulent starters I have had in a buffet spread. The fish tikka just melts in your mouth. Their dal makhni is delightful & one of the best I have had .  The mutton dishes are very sinful. Dont miss out on these. Ok I havent spoken about the veg at all. They are also great & all you vegetarians will be awed for sure. Loads of options & you wont be disappointed for sure .  If you are looking to relish on some rich tasting punjabi food accompanied with great hospitality & drinks then look no further than the Dhaba ."
4.0,"Dhaba had been on my bookmarked list for a long time and finally when they opened up in Marathalli as well I decided to give it a try. Located on the very busy outer ring road, this place is easy to find. The lobby entrance to the restaurant itself gives you a sneak preview of the 'Desiness' you are about to experience with bright colors, catchy posters and photo booth sort of thing made up. On the inside, there is a bar , dining area, buffet spread area which has so many steel tiffins on the wall, some quirky wall paintings. The staff is dressed up in an Indo attire to blend in with the restaurant theme. We were all the more eager to simply place our order and devour some good North Indian food. We ordered: 1. Punjabi kukkad masala- Tomato onion based chicken dish with not much gravy, semi dry bhuna masala chicken. I totally loved this dish. It has that earthy feel to eat with the perfect mix of Indian masalas and wasn't too spicy so it hit the right note with my taste buds. 2. Chitta butter chicken- Now, they have two types of Butter chicken. This one is creamy onion based while the other is the more often found tomato based curry. Mind you this dish was also quite good and the gravy was so damn rich in texture. Totally undestimated how filling this could be. They have quite a list of Lassis to offer, we tried a dry fruit one and was good. We ordered some breads like Laccha paratha, garlic naan to go along with the main course. Now you can't just end there right! So we ordered Moong daal halwa and trust me it was divine. It was served piping hot, garnished with dry fruits and the oh so yummy Ghee which I could see and the dish looked so inviting, absolutely did not care about the calories in it. It was just amazing and totally worth the unhealthiness :P  Impressed with this place the first time, I also went the very next weekend again to try out their buffet and even that was pretty decent. Complimentary drinks were Shikanji and Aam panna both of which were nice. Good variety of starters which are different from the other buffet places simply because of the Indian twist and masalas in every item. Good options of Chicken, fish, mutton and prawns were available in the non veg starters. Tried a couple of veg starters and even they were good. In main course they had Chicken biryani which was really nice, mutton saagwala, paneer khurchan, fish, daal and a few more things. Almost everything I tried was good and their daal was brilliant. For the desserts, there was Jalebi with Rabdi, Moong dal halwa, ice cream, phirni, kheer, angoori jamuns. But I still enjoyed my halwa more during my previous experience when it was served hot and in the buffet, the halwa did not do justice to the first time I tried it. All in all a good spread and satisfying indeed. This is more of a fine dine dhaba so expect the prices to be on the higher side for a l carte. Their staff is very warm and prompt in service and who knows you might just witness their fun dance gig.Great food, good ambience and one of the good North Indian food options especially in Marathalli. Just wished the prices for the Indian breads could be more reasonable."
1.0,Where is the order???
1.0,"Went to this place with lots of expectation, but totally totally disappointing experience. The food costed us Rs.949/person and the quality of food is so average that it was not at all worth the money.  Don't recommend."
1.0,"We had a different expectation all together, when we chose this restaurant to feed ourselves. Overpriced and the quality of food is below average. Totally disappointed."
5.0,great food but the roomali roti was a little disappointing as It wasn't soft. was too coarse and hard unlike what a roomali roti should be like. rest was
4.0,"I didn't know I could get so yummy north Indian food in Bangalore. Dhaba changed my view. I walked into the restaurant because I liked the name. I had expectations, and they were more than fulfilled. Its a place I'll recommend to everyone who wants to have yummy North Indian food.  The place was lively when we reached. With a band performing live, and a group of friends enjoying their meal while laughing and smiling and shouting. We took a table at a corner, and settled in for an awesome treat.  The wall decor is beautiful, with punjabi written all over it. And the food was as good as the decor.  We ordered masala papad, garlic naan, kanastari baingan bhartha, and daal makhani.  Naan was soft with good amount of garlic present on it. Tasted great.  Baingan Bhartha was served in kanastari, which was new to me, and presentation looked great. He bhartha tasted amazing too. Spicy, and something which can remind you of bhartha that you might be so used to eating at your home.  But the show was stolen by daal makhani. It tastes heavenly. And even though I loved it, the quantity was so much that we were not able to finish it. Properly prepared, with apt amount of creaminess to it. Lovely.  After the main course, was the time for desserts. And what's better than Gulab jamun, especially when they're served with pistachio. Two huge soft Gulab jamuns were served in a small katori, and we just had to attack on them. Another brownie point earned by the restaurant, for the amazing taste of the dessert.  Ambiance was great. And service was quick too. This might become my to go place in bangalore. Definitely will be suggesting my friends to go here."
5.0,"awesome experience. Never had food soo yum. Do try their lassi. Paneer dishes will melt in your mouth. would love to visit again. And about ambience, it quiet that of delhi culture styled theme"
4.0,visited this place with family and friends.This place has funky walls and beautiful seating.It gives a dhaba like feel to you. service is slow.If you visit this place the one thing that you must eat is chicken butter masala.The best chicken butter masala I have tasted ever. The other dishes were ok ok.
4.0,"Well, Marathahalli is one place I go to only in case of team lunches or dinners. Otherwise my radar doesn't usually cover this area! I crave for North Indian food quite often and I am in a constant lookout for places serving those delights. I happened to visit Dhaba with my office group after I heard some rave reviews about the place. The a aesthetics and interiors give you the feeling of a Modern Dhaba with bold graphics and quirky captions on the wall.  As we seated ourselves after a long day at work, we ordered a whole set of items! Tandoori Bhune huye aloo, Paneer Tikka, Amritsari Machhi, Amritsari Kukkad and Galauti Kebab was what we ordered. Oh, how I loved the veg starters.. Was in awe of the Tandoori Bhune huye aloo and the paneer Tikka! Just perfect. The Galauti Kebab needs improvement, as I love my Galauti really soft and melt in mouth. Having adapted myself to that taste in the North, I really find it difficult to adapt to the taste here. I happened to try a mocktail and a cocktail during this span. We ordered quite a lot, I didn't get a chance to try them all. My favorite amongst the mocktails was the Aam Panna and Laal Paani amongst the cocktails. Toofan was quite good too. And coming to Dhaba and not having a lassi, not done. We tried the different types of Lassi this place offers and we were floored! I loved them all.  Moving to the main course, we had Paneer Makkhan Maar ke, Chitta Butter Chicken, Balti Meat and their Dal Dhaba. This place serves the best Dal Makhani, hands down to the Dal. Also, the Chitta Butter Chicken for me was the star with succulent chicken pieces in a white cashew gravy! Loved it. The Balti Meat came a close second with those tender mutton pieces in a rich gravy.  We ended our meal with a selection of the best desserts. Gulab jamuns, rasmalai, Phirni, Rabdi, badam halwa and Dhaba Da Meetha. How I loved them all and digged in forgetting everything! I love their desserts, I have been a fan since the time I visited their Indiranagar outlet. Their desserts are an absolute delight.  Overall, a great place to satisfy your north-indian food cravings! Do tag your gang along and relish the delicacies.  Burrrrraaaah!                                             thefatummy.wordpress.com"
5.0,"Highly recommended place for Buffet lunch. I really like their prompt service and attention to each and every group, irrespective of the size. We liked the food as well. Pretty good spread of around 12 starters and non veg starters has a decent split of fish and mutton, more importantly most of them tasted good. We didn't have much appetite for main course, only tried some Butter Naan with mutton and fish gravy, again didn't disappoint us. Don't forget to try the hot Jalebi with Rabdi and other desserts. Overall a memorable experience and would love to visit again."
4.0,Been here for al lunch buffet. The location is easily accessible and the ambience is good. they have put in efforts to make it look like a dhaba. the food is good. the starters were great. main course had a decent spread. but you have a limited dessert options. the service was great.
4.0,A good place to try. Good ambiance. Nice staff. I loved the live music the most. Food taste is good. Lassi is must try. but a little costly.
5.0,awwome
5.0,One of the great place in Marathahalli to look for if you are craving for delicious north indian taste. Ambiance here will make you feel good while having your food. Must recommend this place to try atleast once and experience the food and ambiance
5.0,Very tasty and good packaging
4.0,I normally don't like to go for buffet but this buffet restaurant review had compelled me to visit the restaurant. I must say the starters are too good and deserve the ratings it got. The cocktails are also something new that I have tasted. Good food with dedicated employee is the winning team.
2.5,"Overrated dhaba in marathahalli.. Food was good.. Ambience was nice.. But for a single glass of buttermilk, which they named as Chennai express, we had to pay 239+taxes.. Due to these kind of rates, not worth going again even if the food and ambience was ok.."
4.0,"we had gone to this place for a quick dinner and it turned out to be a really nice place.  Food : Food here is really good. we ordered one paneer gravy(don't remember the name now). 1 naan, lacha paratha and raita. everything was really good.  Ambience : Ambience here is like a North Indian dhaba except they had good live music.  service : service is good and everything is value for money."
5.0,If you are craving for some North Indian flavour then this is the place. Ambience is good. But my rating is dedicated to their prompt n polite service and of course my fav Balti meat and paneer makhan mar ke just perfect with garlic naan. Dhaniya allo and Dal makhani with variety of crisp laccha paranthas were good too. The  food portions are generous. LIIT is made to perfection. The Banta jaljeera was enjoyed by my kiddo. So all in all the experience was fantastic.
1.0,poor packing
3.0,"This place serves good food, brilliant ambiance is a cherry. What resisted me from giving 4 star was overpriced items. Food and alcohol both are overpriced. A pint of beer in 500 bucks seriously. Staffs are decent."
1.0,"ordered food. after 1 hour it was showing it has been delivered. however later through zomato i came to know it cant be delivered. not zomato' s fault but this type of customer experience will not help them as i ordered fresh using swiggy from some other place. not for food but for service , delivery and professionalism this dhaba gets 0 star from me."
4.0,"The food here is good. They served us some different varieties of chicken and fish in starters. If you are hungry and looking for a place with standard good food, i will recommend you this place."
1.0,too oily. saw an extremely thick layer of oil floating above the curry. almost 1/4th of the container.
5.0,"This place is awesome!! love the ambience, food, music and service!!!... Great place to dine with family and friends.. warm atmosphere!!... The band, Kavach, was awesome, especially the lead singer, Vishal!!.. they are a must to listen to!!.. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family and will be back soon!!"
3.5,"Locating the restaurant is easy.  Valet parking is available.  What's good Presentation of food is good. Proximity to offices. The ambience to set up the vibe of Dhaba is nice.  How's food Of the dishes ordered- Galouti Kebad, Nalli Nihari( Think gravy and a little spicy) were the pick of the lot. Butter Chicken & Murgh Tikka were decent. Amritsari Machhi (Salty and oily) was let down. Overall good food.  What's not so good Nothing noteworthy for now.  Bottom Line - All in all a good outing."
3.0,"Dhaba 1986 is situated in Marathalli on the service road of ORR and near the ABs. The food tastes delicious and the quantity of the serving is fine too. The only challenge is the over priced menu as the curries are priced ~400+ , similar for starters . A normal 3 course meal for a couple will cost you 2500 with a usual dhaba setup . The ambience is not great either ."
5.0,"The only place in Bangalore which plays retro hits from 90s, live bands playing ever green songs, Gazal nights are amazing here too. Finally, A good family place in Marathalli.  My recommendation- started: Bhuna Aaloo, Main course: MEAt balti, and dont ever miss the desserts.  Will love to come again soon !"
3.5,"Lovely service. The waiters are courteous, coming in for helping with the menu, patiently take the order, and offer to serve without being overbearing. The manager was lovely too, offering us complimentary curd when I found the gravy too spicy. There was also live music on Friday night. Apart from the volume being too high, we thoroughly enjoyed the performance. The only downside was the average taste of food - soya chhaap and veg mix. The breads were very well made though. The phirni dessert was good too."
4.0,"Great food for the people who love North Indian cuisine. We tried the buffet, and it was really tasty.  I judge a buffet often by the choice of desserts and was not disappointed. Keeping with the Delhi theme, the desserts were rabdi, jalebi, Gilab jamun, moong dal halwa, and firni, all equally tasty. The waiters were nice and polite too. Will definitely like to come back here for more. Plus they have a valet parking as well."
4.0,Ambience : very nice. The serving staff did an impromptu dance as well. A good surprise for the people. The songs played are bollywood and really good dance numbers.  Food : the buffet options were limited. So we decided to go for ala carte. We had ordered gulati kebab for starters. The best I have had till date. For main course we had their special Balti mutton curry and Naan. Mutton was very soft and came in a cute little bucket. Good food and good customer service.
4.0,"I happened to visit this place on a weekday and it was almost vacant. The decor has fun liners and old movie posters giving the place a full desi feel!  Here's what all I tried :  Choti Glassiyan - This has mini versions of 6 mocktails, Jaljeera, Aam Panna, Shikanji, Kala Khatta, Ganne ka sa Ras and Rangeela. The one I liked the most was Kala Khatta! For Starters I had Tandoori Bhune Aloo and Galouti Kebab, Galouti kebabs were really soft but I liked the Aloo better, it was crispy and lip smacking! Main course was all my favorite food, Daal Makhni, Paneer Makhni, Lachcha Paratha and Missi Roti. Daal Makhni was definitely the creamiest and the best, a must have here. Also tried the Dhabe di Roti which has egg as an ingredient making it amazingly soft. Dhabe da Meetha for dessert was a good end to the sumptuous meal. North indians are going to love this place! :)  Edit :  Was here to try the new NH menu out and had the Veg Manchurian, Chowmein(after a long long time a good one), Tandoori momos which were melting in the mouth. Loved it. For Main course the Tadke wali Daal and chawal was the best as the Kashmiri Dum aloo and Papad ki sabzi was a bit on the spicier side. The Rasgulla and Rasmalai were a perfect end of the meal. Missed having Dal Makhni though!  Vedshree (@littlefoodiegirl) littlefoodiegirl.com"
3.5,Good service...better ambience than Indranagar outlet..very courteous staff.  Now the actual fact...food was average...balti meat  was average. Galouti kabab was also  average. Paneer tikka khade masala was good but missed capsicum and onions.. Roomali roti was not as served in Delhi.. Too costly I must say. Try if you have discount offers as I did.
5.0,"The wares and utensils picked up from differentplaces,oldBollywood movie posters-add a special zing to itthat make it unique anddesi. Which means when you sit down to eat, all the cutlery and crockery will be different from eachother. Ifyou havent been here yet, you must plan a visit soon.  Anotherfabulous thing about thisplace,isthe food. Dig into theirflavoursomedelights from the extensive menu that offers a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarians North Indiandishes. My favourites - TheDhaba PaneerTikka-Mildly spicedchunks of cottage cheeseflavouredwith premium saffron. Surprisingly what was most palatable to me was the TandooriBhuneAloo;Tandoor roasted baby potatoes, shallow fried and tossed withspices,onionsandsaunth chutney.  Chotiglassiyankicoctailsmade anappearance next. They were our classic cocktails pimped and madedesithat havequirky,funnames. The Sarson ka saag,chitta chicken and lassi was brilliant. The old school Indian desserts were out of the world and something I hadnt had in the longesttime  namely theBadamhalwa(heaps of ghee that made it the way it was),Rasmalai,Phirni,GulabJamunand what was most interesting was theDhabeDaMeethawhich was a layered combination of Vanillaicecream,Shahitukdaand MiniGulabJamunwith SaffronRabri."
2.5,"On the first impression it would look like a fun place. And it is. Live ghazal afternoon was the one we @visited.  Food is very average. We ordered the veg platter for starters and choti glassiyan(assorted mock tails in mini glasses). The only good thing in starters was the Galouti kebab. Drinks were very meh.   They charge 79/- for a roti/naan/kulcha. Kulcha was not a Kulcha. And tandoori paratha was missing it's taste. Baigan bharta was under done.   All in all, I was disappointed. Lively ambience but very average food."
4.0,"The reason why I have given 5 is because of the ambiance, setup, serviceability and innovation. From the entrance, lights , 1986 decorations to the Punjabi all were great. Since I am not a fan of North Indian food and I havent tasted much in my life I would give a rating of 5 but with chances of editing the same to 4.5 or 4 if I encounter North Indian food which is better than Dhabas and similar to this restaurant's category. Must try: Fish amritsari, Dhaba Da meetha."
5.0,"I have ordered food for home delivery. Awesome food, good packaging, best quality food i have ever ate from outside. Felt like home. Breads were so soft to eat. Must try items - Dhaba Paneer Tikka, Achari Soya Chap, Lacchaa Prantha, Dhabe Di Roti. Thank you for delivering great food. :)"
4.5,"* craving for authentic north Indian food, this is the place*. I was there for the second time, such an amazing experience. Ambience, Service, Food, well cooked, authentic taste, live music. Meat balti- well cooked, a treat to your taste buds. Paneer butter masala- takes you down the memory lane, definitely back to Delhi. *happy tummy* :) In my opinion, one thing that the management can change is revise the pricing, I feel it is a bit over expensive. Zomato - zomato Gold could really Help. Please approch them. :)"
5.0,"Awesome food and ambiance...North Indian food lovers must visit this place..Must try Amritsari fish, Gulauti Kabab, Balti meat, Butter chicken..N last but not the list desserts... typical North Indian desserts Dhabe di meetha, badam halwa, Rabri & Tila Kulfi.....Overall great experience!"
5.0,"Amazing food. Amazing ambience. The place just lifts up your spirit. Went for a team lunch and had an amazing time. In middle of the course, all the staff broke into a Punjabi dance. That was like cherry on the cake for the mood. All the dishes are very tasty. The aam panna takes us back to childhood. We had an amazing experience. It's a must try for anyone who's wanting to explore a new restaurant with good food and ambience."
2.0,"Visited this place for team lunch today (non-veg buffet). None of us enjoyed the food. Two starters (pepper chicken and some tandoori chicken) tasted stale. Unfortunately they were the first two items served. That set the tone.  I should have donated the amount spent here at some charity instead. Never ever ever (x Arnab times) will even think of visiting this place again.  Aam Pana drink was the best, few fish starters were also good."
4.0,"A must go place, for north Indian taste and feel. Superb at taste and ample variety to try & taste. Visiting this pace was sheer joy after having shifted from Delhi to Bangalore few months back. Very well maintained and positive ambiance."

4.5,"** Experience Dhaba at this place**  Yesterday Our team lunch was planned at this place, we were almost 34 so one whole area was occupied by our team. More than the food the ambience and the little performance from the staff on party numbers I loved more. The staff here is courteous and very friendly. They have typical Dhaba setup and items are differently named in Hinglish. Overall the ambience is catchy  We opted for Buffet and with my past experience I can say that this is one of the best place for veggies, they have wide varieties of starters in veg. Almost all starters were very good. But Chilly Fish and Crispy aloo were my favourites of the day.They also have live counter for Karai sabzi,you can choose your choice of vegetables there and they will prepare it for you and serve it on table. They served complimentary drink (Aam panna or Thandai). You can find the complimentary beer on just zomato menu, when we enquired them about that, they concluded by saying that they don't have stock.  Coming to main course, I feel that they had right varieties of items. Because it was not too much and not even less too.As most of us fill our tummies with more of starters and deserts when you go for buffet. Butter nan ,Roti and Paratha were served at our seats and it was good.  Jumping to my favourite area, Deserts were good. Sad thing is I had cold n cough  I could just tried to taste it. Moong dal ka halwa,Rabri, Gulab jamoon, Kheer and Jelabi were there. Rabri made my day . Ice cream was also kept but I didn't touched it .  Overall it was nice experience at this place, Hariyani style Dhaba, retro experience. I have to mention about the music they played ,playlist was very nice with all remix and Bollywood music. The staff performed for few party songs which was very special.  Food:4/5 Service:5/5 Value for money:4.5/5"
4.0,"I am writing this review just after coming back from the restaurant. We were a huge group and opted for their lunch buffet. The starters were amazing, both veg and non-veg. One veg starter: Beetroot pakoda hit my taste buds at the right places. The starters along with the complimentary mock-tails [Aam panna and Thandai] were served at our tables by the courteous staff. Then we moved towards the wide spread main course. They have a live counter for karai sabzi (Mixed of Bhindi, Baby corn, Beans, etc) You can choose which one to take and they will serve you with the finished product. And finishing the delicious lunch with the mouth watering Moong Dal Ka Halwa, Gulab Jamun, Jalebi, Rose Kheer, Phirni, Rabri and of-course Ice-cream. I became a big fan of their Rabri. :p And at last, I should talk about their quirky Haryanvi decor. Many things are happening at the same time which gives more than Dhaba vibes.   Note: They have amazing stuff who performed on some party numbers for the guests."
4.5,"This place is the newly opened branch of Dhaba by clarideges   It owns up to the standards of the chain , the food and ambience is great   Also the waiters are coming from the other chains , so they know what they're doing as well."
2.0,"Disappointed!  I went here yesterday with my friends.. i guess we were their last customers.  I ordered Kadhai Paneer and Tandoori roti.. which was fine My friends ordered Galouti Kabab for starter.. they said it was really bad. For main course they ordered butter chicken and naan which was fine.  They had also ordered lime soda which was too flat to be soda.. it was like water with little lemon, salt and sugar.  Glasses for water were not clean.  Waiters couldnt understand and respond to us.  They have tried to do a lot with interiors but what is point when food and service is not good.  Everything cant go wrong because we were their last customers."
5.0,"Wow... A whole lot to tell!!! Saturday done perfectly   New dhaba in town.. went for lunch today without any reservations as it came on our way & we were definitely too hungry to even zomatofyy the reviews etc etc.. !! Colors everywhere.. first thing that attracted us was the quotes written everywhere ..one of them- ""thand rakh .. darru pe"" ...  They just handed us over the menu but came with another menu of butfet. Just by looking at the menu I was dammn hungryy.. so took a quick look at the buffet table.. hunger went up like 10 timess more!! They serve you starter's & one drink at the table.. we had 2 choices aam panna & shikanji n yupp kingfisher beer... No thoughts given, took both aam panna & shikanji .... both were okss (little extra sweetalthough) @8 starters were served on the table.. so a veg person generally expect paneer mushroom pineapple.. but here it was little different.. they first gave pani puri with 2 types n pani n papdi chat.. delighted!! Then a long train of food.. starting with panner tikka, stuffed veggies, corn tikki, spring roll, galauti k kabab, chilli panner, fried potatoes, n one more.. Out of allll thiss superb tasty starters best was galauti k kabab.. (surely gonna visit soon for that dish).. Now came the turn for maincourse .. starring with veg biriyani, jeera rice, palak paneer, amritsari chole, daal, baigan ka bharta & gobi allo with cream.. pineapple chat, salad, 4 types of papad, 2 type curd n curd rice n daal ka sorba.. we had a lot to eatt.. & offcourse the pickle They gave us 3 choices in bread naan, tandoori roti, lacha paratha.. (while writing the review ..I am feeling I should visit soon) Dessets were my focus n attraction of the day.. rabdi, phirni, icecream, gulab jamun, moong daal halwa & jalebi.. goshh we were extra full..  Must try place... Great service.. good ambience & music .. 10/10 They have made the washroom also filmy .. :)  After longg so satisfied with a place .. definitely deserves 5/5 from my side.. keep up the good work..!!"
3.5,"MEAT BALTI - Have to give 10/10 !! If you are a mutton fan and dont get good mutton in Bangalore then this is a goto place . Though 3 pieces of it would cost Rs 449/- but i Guess its worth it. Ordered amritsari kukkad which was OK. Naan and Kulcha was great !  The problem we had was on the drinks side, we ordered the 6 glass i which costs around rs600 which came after half an hour after repeated repeated reminders!!  Which was a turn down. Then to our surprise we ended up paying around Rs 200 as service tax for the drink which would make it total as Rs800 which was mot worth it. Most of the glassiya did not have alcohol (very little) .kala khatta was a disappointing one.BUT my point here is WHY this service charge !!! Is it not illegal or something?? You should  come here at the starting of the month so that it can dig a big hole in your pocket (haha). Pricing and service needs improvement but I am definitely going back for MUTTON balti!!"
1.0,I ordered food online from this restaurant and the order was canceled after one hour saying that delivery guy is not available. If you were unable to deliver the order why you accepted it on the very first hand.I waited one hour and after that they canceled the order. The service sucks both from the restaurant and zomato. Zomato online sucks and the restaurant as well.
2.5,"THOROUGH DISAPPOINTMENT ON A BIRTHDAY !  Visited yesterday with family on occasion of my 33rd birthday.  Ordered the 6 mini glass drinks + Starters - Dhaba Paneer & Bhune Aloo + Malai Kofta & breads + Mawa Lassi. Did not bother to order rice and desserts after the compelling disappointments.  All 6 drinks were highly concentrated - we were drinking syrup ! When pointed out, the female waiter / manager promptly justified - Yes, they are using syrups ! (and not freshly made drinks) Now, they are charging 255+ taxes for these little glasses of concentrated syrups !  The starters were OK. The Paneer was well made and the potatoes crunchy.  The ultimate spoiler was the Malai Kofta. I had explicitly requested the waitress that we eat very less spicy food- hence the safe decision to order Malai Kofta (which is typically mild and sweetish) But what we got (inspite of the request) was peppery hot gravy devoid of the delicateness that Malai kofta is supposed to have.  A burning mouth which prompted me to order the Mawa Lassi which was devoid of any visible Mawa or even cream ! - it was skimmed sweet curd for Rs. 215 !  Not to mention, the waiter had changed and our order of Dhaba Roti was forgotten ! ( I had ordered all breads together but one was forgotten) After a delay of several minutes and a reminder- it finally arrived. The place was hardly busy- only my family and another group of 4 friends at a nearby table.   I wonder how the service will be if they have a full house.  Did not bother to order rice and daal and desserts because I didnt want to spoil the rest of my birthday.   The food is pretty expensive and it is a disappointment if you dont get value for money - (even after you have made an explicit request for less spicy food) plus forgetting the order and making the customer wait till the unbearable food gets cold.  The decors are brilliant though.  Punjabi By Nature or Kapoor's cafe Avoid this place.  (I had booked the table through Dine Out (50% off Offer) so there was no hole burnt in my pocket but my birthday lunch was a disaster thanks to this place) THEY DID NOT EVEN WISH ME ON MY BIRTHDAY (details entered on Dine Out while booking)"
4.5,Good place to hangout. Lively place.. good service.. Do try chaap ... Its yummy.  Ambience is good with hindi and punjabi music. Totally dilli style.
4.5,"Eventhough I got food delivered from here and haven't tasted too many things,but sometimes the packaging and just that one dish tells you how classy the place is.The moment i saw the word Delhi I was rooting for them.As nothing beats the food in delhi and they lived up to their name.  I had their baalti meat and it was succulent and spot on.The green chutney was finger licking good.I intend to dine in and explore more.But meanwhile I will stop here.  Update 17Feb Well i finally decided to visit the place.Loved the chicken pulao,malai tikka,dal makhni,bhatinda chicken...lassi n shikanji was nice....so all in all totally worth it"
2.5,"In short, ""Unchi Dukan Feeka Pakwaan"".  Alacarte : Highly overpriced for the quantity provided. Taste is also Average. Buffet: Variety was less compared to buffet prices.  We went for Alacarte, in starters, paneer was good. Rest chicken n mutton were normal in taste. Nothing much special. In main course, quantity was normal but again price was on higher side. Our bill amount was 4000 for 5 people and we felt like hardly we ate for that amount."
4.0,"The huge banner on the Outer Ring Road showing their ""Balti Meat"" has been calling out to me for quite some time now, and finally I gave in, and went there on a Friday afternoon. The place is very nicely lit and decorated, and the ambience with the live music is very nice. Service is also quick and the staff is friendly.  We started off with some Veg and Mutton Galawti kebabs. They were very soft and yummy !! Followed by some cocktails - the 6 pack, of which we found the Kala khatta one to be the best. Also took a Mewa lassi, which was good, but we have had better.  For the Main course, the long-awaited Balti meat came in, and it was so yummy and the meat was just fall-of-the-bone good. I ate up all of it with a couple of garlic naans and roomali rotis.  We were too full to go for any desserts, but this is one place I am definitely coming back for more."
5.0,"We were hungry and were looking for a new place to pamper our taste buds and we found this place in Marathahalli, near to Nagarjuna / Udipi. The food is absolutely yummy! the very fist bite and you can remember the classic scene of the movie ""Ratatouille"" - when the critique writer is blown away by the very taste of the food. Service is awesome. they ensured that the Jalebi's were freshly made for us so that we could enjoy the Jalebi & Rabdi as a sweet dish.... There stock of Jalebis was finished by the time we ordered late in the evening. The crew there gives there are excellent at serving and making you feel so comfortable. All all this pampering when we were there just for dinner (no drinks). The paneer was fresh and chicken so soft. The curry gave that authentic typical Dhaba nostalgia. Mango Lassi & Chaach were so very well done! Even their mouth freshner got that fresh aroma and classic taste! & ...Oh! I just forgot to mention that each dish is served in a way that the pans have coal heated bases - so that the food remains hot all the while you are being served. Enjoy the hot and fresh food even if you plan to take your own good time...No hurry -no worry :) Good things don't come cheap and I would say the same for this restaurant. It gives you an apt value for the money that you pay.Please don't go in there with a mentality of comparing the food price with any other run of the mill restaurant (I read some complaining about the price)- this place is a class apart starting right from the ""Dhaba"" theme it has its interior done. I was was long looking for a place where I could spend, enjoy, be pampered, get the right taste and feel damn good about it - I just found one!! Can you believe that each and every crew in the restaurant were dancing and they put up a small show for a guest who was celebrating his birthday!! They have delivered me the out-of-the-world experience after such a long time of what I have been in Bangalore - Thank you guys!!...I will come again :))"
4.0,"We went on to try this new restaurant on a special occasion and it turned out to be good one.  We tried Galouti Kabab in starters which was nice and tasting even better with spicy green chutney. Zaffrani Malai Kofta in main course was good which we had with Roomali Roti and Dhabe di Roti. Specifically Dhabe di Roti was awesome and a must try if you are here. You will not find this kind of roti elsewhere. Roomali Roti was a bit hard and thick, not good.  Overall food was good, however service was a bit slow. Ambience is too good and typical Desi Dhaba style which I liked a lot."
4.5,This joint has come up near Marathalli recently and I have been eying for it for sometime. Finally I got an opportunity yesterday.  Food was excellent. You can get good variety of typical Punjabi and North Indian food. I ordered Galauti kebab and chicken taka tak in starter . Both were too good. Galauti kebabs simply melted in mouth .In main course tried their Balti Wala meat which was simply great with tandoori rotis and rice . I finished by dinner with sips of delicious Lassi which was too good. Ambience- Typical Dhaba set up although Charpai was missing.  Service- very courteous and prompt.  Overall excellent
5.0,"I've been twice to this place and am absolutely in love with it! From the food to the decor to the  music to the service, love it all. I tried both a la carte and buffet in the times I visited and left with a happy tummy. Although the bill was a little too much but I would call it value for money. Badam ka halwa was to die for and then I could just go on writing the dishes :) Great place to treat yourself with some awesome north indian food."
4.5,"OMG!....the food lived up to the expectations and beyond. Very happy i picked DHABA for my birthday lunch.  Restaurant is bright, cheery, spacious. it uplifts your mood from the time you step in.  Every one of the staff has a pleasant demeanor and are very much accomodating. time to time they come asking for seconds and how we like the food without being too interrupting.  Chose the non-veg(we opted chicken only) buffet.incl.veg. starters, breads, beverages served at the table. all items are fresh and piping hot. there are a lot, cannot even begin to cover all of them here.  i have posted the buffet menu in the pics but there are simply put... more items in addition to the ones mentioned there.  chaat:- pani puri is the best you get in bangalore, so crispy and yumm...never a chaat fan but ohh...this is the stuff. dahi papdi is amazing too.  also they have a seperate tawa counter if we want to try some tawa items before the main course, we skipped it. not to forget the various achaars/pickles.  Veg Starters:- tandoori bhune aloo, veg kathi roll, chilli paneer, dhaba paneer tikka, tandoor gobi, hare mattar ki tikki, corn palak sheekh, dal pakodi.  corn palak sheekh is nicely spiced. tandoor gobi is tasty. dal pakodi is homely. dhaba paneer tikka is soft like a cloud. this is on another level altogether.  Chicken Starters:- chilly chicken, chicken kathi roll, amritsari kukkad, murgh malai tikka.  loved the kukkad a lot. malai tikka, chilly chicken are full of flavors.  Main Course:- chicken biryani is well done, baingan gravy is lovely, a must try. dum ka murgh, dhaba dal, corn palak curry, paneer curry all are worth trying.  Beverages, Desserts:- we were served a complimentary drink of our choice, lime soda, its refreshing. we did not try the desserts(there are many) but had gulaabo lassi instead. my spouse liked it a lot. the sugar could be trimmed down further though.  they forgot to include lassi in final bill but added later after we brought to their attention. the extra lime soda we ordered other than complimentary drinks came with discount on it.  overall it was a very welcoming lunch.  we requested for takeaway of sarson ka saag and makki roti from their special winter menu. awesome packing.  Service is what i loved besides the delectable food and decor. sincerely hope they maintain the same standards across repeat visits.  highly recommended. thank you to the chefs. great job guys."
4.5,"Makki di roti , te sarso da saag ho ve Naal usdelaasi da swaad ho ve ! Mithi Mithi Kheer Vekh , Neeyat vi kharaab ho ve !  You must have heard this saying in indian movies or so , quite popular !. Infact Punjabits music , culture , people and most of the food is popularand cinematised in movies and media !  I love Punjabifood and most of all their music & dance. Yet it was myfirst time trying Makki di roti & Sarso da Saag) . I am convinced that poem or saying on this popular combinationisno hype ! I reminisced about sarso da sang and Makki di rotifor the next two daysafter my dinner ! Simple yet wholesome , complex yet simple Flavours  Must try /Top Pick - My top pick &must try is Makki di roti &sarso da saag at Dhaba , served with white butter and jaggery**  Detailed review read below :  1.Dcor/ Ambience ( 4.5 /5) :  The dcor is vibrant & colorfull , with quirky wall dcor accentsand a brightly lit bar section . They have a separate section which can be taken up bylarge groups and is decorated around the wrestling theme , Its rustic and with bits and bobs on display from thewrestling theme in contrast to the fun looking main seating area . How I wish there was a portion where rustic low lying seating , indhaba style was also part of this place. Coming to the ambience- Fun peppy 90s music in the background , and the staff breaking into a dance in between adds fun to the experienceand makes the place lively while you tap your feet and eat away to your full potential as the food is good here .  2. Service (5/5) Friendly and attentive , Not only they attend to tables  the same staff break into a dance and perform for the visitors enthusiastically .  Food :(5/5)  **Top Picks**  **Starters : Galouti Kebab , Paneer Tikka , Tandoori Bhune hue Aloo **Drink : Mawa di Laasi **Maincourse : Sarso da Saag , Balti Meat & chitta butter chicken **Dessert : Dhabha da meeta , Rabri  Full Grub story :  ::Drinks :: Choti Glassiyan  6 small glasses with different types of Cocktails or Mocktails . The names are fun too . If you are not big on lassi  try this out  How is it possible to not try Lassi at a Punjabi Restaurant , I opted for Mawe di lassi, itsthick , creamy and topped with dryfruits it will make you full so dont gulp it down like I did  ::Starters ::  If you have to choose one starter in nonveg go for gelouti kebab , by far the best I have eaten and I eat out a lot . In veg Tandoori Bhune Aloowas great, it was sweet and spicy wit chat like flavours . Never tried anything like it before and it was delicious Panner Tikka  Another very well done starter ,if you area paneer fan then opt for this one . Murg Tawa Masala  Tender chicken starter with well coated masala Amritsari Machi  I have tried this starter in so many places , but dhaba did a good job with it . Tandoori Prawns  Large size prawns , very flavourfull and presented well  ::Main course: : Usually Starters get all the attention in restaurants and become the stars , but at dhaba you should save some space and look forward to main course . Sarso da Saag & Makki di roti with white butter and Gud  do I even need to say anything more about this one ? I sampled chitta butter chicken and Balti mutton as well , Both of them well made. Chitta butter chicken gravy was unlike anything easily available elsewhere  white sauce and mildly spiced and balti mutton , the mutton was melt in the mouth soft .  ::Desserts ::  Dhabha da meeta all good things in it  layer of icecream ,Rabri , Gulab jamoon ,dryfruits & somemore . Rabri was rich , creamy and cold  loved it Rasmalai ,Badam halwa & Phirni  I sampled a half spoon full, all were good but found the halwa and phirni extrasweet  or I was too stuffed to eat anymore . If you have to pick one go for dhabha da meeta  3. Cost (4 /5) Slightly overpriced overall in comparison to other places but the quality and quantity justifies it , butPrawn dishes I found them to be expensive . However they have Lunch buffet for 699 - 799 rs which is a steal .  ::Overall verdict :: 4.5/5  30 yr old brand , popularly known in delhiasDhaba by claridges . has been expanding their branches . They have establishes 2 outlets in Bangalore 2 decades of experience in Punjabi cuisine did reflect in whatever we ate . In general food is very flavourful, well balancedand wholesome without being greasy . You have to try it to know it !"
4.0,"Had lunch buffet here. Options were good considering the price.  Loved the desserts!! Service sometimes feels a bit off! Ambiance is nice, welcome drinks were awesome."
1.0,The signature dish Balti mutton was really bad . And all items are overrated..  Not at all happy with the food and billing. Additional services changes are added in the bill along with  GST.
4.5,"Finally, a restaurant in Marathahalli which not only serves authentic Punjabi cuisine but also, provides the perfect ambience you look for in a roadside dhaba. Whether it be the filmy posters on the walls or the deck playing 90s Bollywood numbers sequentially, they all add up to the ambience. And not to forget the special performance by the entire staff on few of the party songs in between your food journey creates a sensation altogether. Service is top notch and the staff is friendly and courteous. They take care of every teeny tiny need of a customer during the entire course of the food journey, which is really impressive. Coming to the food, I got to relish most of their specialities. For the starters, I had : Masala papad - Crispy and spicy papad served with the tomato and green chilly masala was bound to heighten the appetite.  Paneer Tikka - Succulent paneer chunks combined with pudina chutney were remarkable and melted nicely in the mouth.  Amritsari Kukkad - Massive chicken pieces served in an iron box shaped container was perfectly cooked and appetizing.  Galouti kabab - Honestly, I never had such delicious Galoutis before. The kababs were soft and tasted yum with the pudina chutney.  Tandoori bhune hue aloo - I absolutely fell in love with this dish. The sweet and sour affair furnished in this recipe was truly delightful.  Murg tawa masala - Again, wonderful preparation and excellent presentation by the chef. Very soft chicken chunks with the masala blended perfectly.  Amritsari machi - This was quite average. Medium spicy and decent taste.  Tandoori prawns - Absolutely delightful. The prawns were soft and tender and flawlessly cooked.  I tried most of the samples of their cocktails and mocktails. For me, the Laal Pari among the cocktails and the Ganne Ka Sa Ras and Aam Panna among the mocktails stood out which forced me for a second serving.  As far as the main course is concerned, there was a huge spread of delectable dishes. The makke ki roti and sarso ka saag won my heart. The white butter and the gud served with the roti is highly addictive.  The next combination which gave me a foodgasm was the butter naan and the balti meat. The mutton was so perfectly cooked and came off easily from the bones.  The chitta butter chicken and Kanastari baigan bharta were drool worthy and the dal makhani was absolutely phenomenal.  Now, it was time for the desserts and I gorged on few of the items. The gulab jamun and badam halwa were really lip smacking. The phirni and rasmalai were average but the dhaba da meetha was impeccable. It had icecream, rabdi and gulab jamun all tucked in together to create a heavenly taste. I did try their lassi varieties and the Mawe di lassi impressed me among the lot.  Overall, it was an amazing evening spent with mouth watering cuisine. Would love to visit this place again. Highly recommended."
2.0,We went out for a Sunday dinner.. It s a usual thing for me and my husband but this one was a real put off experience.. we usually go for a drink at any restaurant but this place seemed more like a foodies delight so we decided to stick to food and mocktail ... We ended up paying more than what we pay with drinks plus food..  Food is too over priced here. I would recommend to eye ball the prices before you order .. Me and my husband never look at prices but after today we will .. 4 pieces of prawn is about 1300 including tax .. it's not a 5 star to price a starter at that rate .. felt cheated and the fact they were undercooked spoils the whole mood .. One doesn't mind paying that much if the food is amazing but even that wasn't the case.. Overall experience of food  wasn't great did not enjoy the whole dining experience.. service is good and quick but overall a disappointing experience ..
4.5,"Visited for a lunch buffet last week. At 600 for veg option, I must say its very reasonably priced.   Some clear standout dishes: paneer tikka (melt in your mouth), pani puri, tawa sabzi (made to order based on ur preference of veggies), dal makhani and Rabdi.   Other dishes were so so but given the price point there are a lot of good options in the buffet to leave you feeling very full.  The flavours were good,service very good and ambience bright and colourful.   Will probably visit again when Im craving North Indian food."
3.5,Ambience is very similar to that of Village only difference is the variety. The variety for Buffet is less but the food is overall and satisfactory. Me and my friend opted for veg and non-veg buffet and the feedback would be Veg buffet is better than the non-veg one at least taste wise. The staffs are very polite and courteous. Overall service is good. Looking at the a la carte menu the prices are on a bit higher side.
5.0,"If I am braving the traffic on a weekday to come to a place, it better be good. Better be darn good. And so I reach and suddenly the mood of this place changes me. Its bright , lively, energetic and so adorable I am smiling ear to ear just looking at the walls. Th seating is spacious ensuring privacy so if I laugh loud and hard its still okay.   I start my dinner soon enough. I would have fairly ignored to mention the papad and masala papad topping that came first before our starter but damn! was so good! the kind of spicy that makes you panting a lil bit and munch all the more.   Tandoori bhune aloo . man that shits crazy. All you northies dying for a glimpse of delhi street life your colleagues have been raving about . Eat this and know the fuss is all about. Absolute lip smacking. The best best best thing ever! And then I look to my right to the plate of tandoori paneer and I am like gosh, thats huge! is it soft? hell yes. its like butter soft creating wonders in my mouth.   All you non veggies are like whats gotta into this woman ? well me too. My meat came soon after. And I smelled the plate far far away. That galouti is a head turner. No wonder my neighbour table ordered the same soon after. This galouti by far is the best one I have eaten and I have eaten in  a lot many places. The smell of meat was foodporn. I am still wondering if the birdflu thingy be worried about and damn the tawa masala comes. on this base the smoke is still running and the masala is already hitting my nose and tempting me to try one bite and I give in. Tawa masala is excatly how your meat should be cooked. the optimum soft , not the falling off meat and spices peeked into the innermost corners, every bite be oolala! Amritsari machi be slightly bland , not oozing its signature vibe . The last I eat before the mains come is the prawns. The omg this is huge prawns. Four pieces but big enough to blow your mind.  That is rad no kidding !   I only thing I wanted to eat here was sarso ka saag , makke roti and balti meat. and good of this two and im like in heaven. a slight complain in either and I wouldnt stop cribbing about it for days to come. Trust me when I tell you , the roti saag with butter and jaggery is pure love. like tears of joy on every bite . The dish is so warm and homecoming we shut up the entire time and just be happy eating this good stuff. Balti meat, omg that meat , the ultimate definition of falling off the bone . They have superior quality of mutton and its evident . Its a plain 10/10 , not complains not one micro point deduction.   If we make a list of rich foods that come our table chitta butter chicken would be somewhere on high top. there is no gravy, all creamy stuff and such supreme that I could gorge just on the cream gravy. That and chapati be killer combo. Much wow. And at the top of the game our very own dal makhani stands proud. All the places with so much talk to making it all night and serving the hard labour outcome falls short. This is where you come to eat the ultimate stuff. This is where your search ends.   When my mummy daddy comes to town, this is where I am coming. :)   I got no stomach for desserts but they go to our heart so one spoon each. Gulab jamun 10/10 ( punjab grill and dhaba are the two places you go to get your gulab jamun fix. Nowhere else) , Rasmalai 9/10 ( medium sweet, hansomely made) , Badam halwa 8/10 ( its a 9/10 for everyone else but it was sweet for me and very very rich . I guess overeating prior foods did alter the numbers here), phirni 7/10 (couldnt place it but something was off , may be the concentration), dhaba da meetha 10/10 ( man this is like a jackpot  . icecream on top of that rabri on top of that gulab jamun and on top of thatheap of nuts!)  I am stuffed. I overate . I am so stocked!   This place gets a 5 from me!"
5.0,"Highway style food with some local flavours included turns it into a flavour-xplosion !!! A team lunch at Dhaba was a hit with all the team-mates because of the humungous buffet spread to begin with. Although Dhaba estd 1986 is known for its Dal Dhaba, Balti mutton and Galoutis, it was a pleasant surprise to see some state cuisine part of the buffet. Love the fun and funky decor. Service impecable. I guess its safe to say that I am a happy customer.  Price : total value for money. Food : hit amongst my group. gypsyneel.com"
4.5,"Dhaba be the new 'it' place this side of town. The place is vivacious. The energy is enthralling. Happy colours , quirky adorn the walls at every corner and I am already happy the minute I entered. No wonder it was going to be a good evening. I love the seating, its comfortable and spacious and big tables so no clumsy scene when many plates arrive.   We started on a very high one. Tandoori Bhune hue aloo was excellent! adjectives fall short on how chatpata this dish was . so tangy, such blast of flavours . I was mouth watering even while having it. Paneer tikka was wow. The best paneer is town is here! Oversize chunks, soft as a baby, and spices digged in just right. Yum! Galouti kebab again a winner . Such a scintillating dish dat one! To be able to hit all the right notes is Rad! Amritsari machi be standard affair, good quantity. Murg tawa masala had such soft meat and all the spices beautifully blend in just apt! It came hot and we couldnt stop munching! Amritsari kukkad had massive cut pieces , excellant taste!  I loved the sample tray of both cocktails and mocktails. The sample quantity itself was quite generous. The cocktail with the cucumber was very refreshing. Ganne ka sa ras was very well made so was the lal paani .   Lets quickly jump to the main course. I have been waiting like an anxious child for the main course to arrive so I can dive into the sarso ka saag , makke ki roti , the homemade heavenly white butter and the gud. Needless to say I was all messy with my two hands but it was worth it! The vibe of generously made ghar ki saag was so freaking evident!  Loved every bit of it and yes, I polished it off! That creamy looking chitta butter chicken should not be missed at all. So heavy on cashew and such creamy taste I tell you! With nan this was a deadly combo. I loved the balti meat. That mutton came off like baby soft ... You have to eat to know how amazing that dish was . A 5 star no less! Butter chicken was standard affair. Baingan bharta was too full of ingredients than I usually eat/like. But that dal makhani, oh my god! such perfection! such simplicity and unpretentous and oh so freaking deadly! No kidding, but I ate two or three plates of it. All of it!   Wait I missed out on the prawns. The jumbo bigg prawns that had the wholesome meat like no other! Those tandoori prawns were love. Litle pricey but sheer love.   For Desserts, Rasmalai was soo good! It was light , sweet but not overdone. and very fresh. I am so thrilled with the gulab jamuns here.  They are excatly how they shud be, not brekadown when you cut into it , soft enough but not the ones that gets all mushy, medium hot when arrives and size good enough to melt my heart. Badam halwa was standard affair. Phirni be too sweet. But that dhaba da meetha . oh god!it had ice cream it had rabri, it had gulab jamun and topped with generous amounts of nuts. To be saying this dish was rich was an understatement and the icecream freeze was a good combo to the sweet other elements.   Loved this day to the core. A trip to this side of the town was worth it.   Heres my rating-  food- 4.7/5  Ambience-4.5/5  Service- 4.7/5  I am going with a 4.5"
4.5,"Dhaba? Yes it is a Dhaba. Perfect dhaba style interiors : lights, wall art, play of colours are all perfect. Loved the special walls they have created there; Bottle stalked wall, dabba(lunch carrier) wall are all so good. Just loved the theme.  There's no second thought about food. Everything tasted so yumm. But very less veg options. Non vegetarians can have a feast there :P Paneer Tikka, Butter Chicken, Lassi, Aam Panna, Paan Mojito, Butter Naan, garlic naan, curries were very tasty.  Iron box kinda containers, small sized glass- desi way of serving as well as taste of cocktails and mocktails are all so cool. Please do visit this place :)"
5.0,Great place and ambience is superb !! Live music and taste of food excellent !! Crew members are extremely supportive and quick too . Service is fast and quick
4.0,Visited the place for our Anniversary dinner. Veg galouti kabab tasted good. Paneer tak a tak was great with a spicy and tangy flavour. Butter chicken as usual tasted the best. The butter tandoori roti and butter naan were hot from the tandoor and tasted real good. To finish off we ended with rasmali. It was chilled and pretty decent in taste. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic North Indian food. Biplob was way helpful and we didnt have to wait much for the orders. Service and ambiance all excellent. Would love to visit again
5.0,"Absolutely loved the buffet spread, music and the ambiance.  Very well trained professional service. Kid friendly.  A definite visit with family."
4.5,"This was one good dinner with some real sumptuous food.  Dhaba estd 1986 has opened their second outlet in the city at Marathahalli. The interiors are very quirky and catchy with bold colours and graphics. The aesthetics and interiors totally give the quintessential feeling of sitting and having food at a Dhaba in Punjab or Delhi. A special mention for playing superb Bollywood tracks all the time.  Coming to the food, the starters were very good. Loved the tandoor bhune hue aloo, amritsari machhi,amritsari kukkad or chicken,paneer tikka and galauti kebabs. Tandoori Bhune hue aloo and galautis need special mention.To gulp these down were choti glass ke mocktails and cocktails. The cocktails were desi versions of the famous cocktails with really unique compositions. My favourite among these were the aam paana in mocktails and lal paani in cocktails. The main course items were huge in number. We loved the makke ki roti and sarso da saag with the sinful amounts of butter and gur. The chitta butter chicken was so full of flavours and consisted of succulent chicken pieces cooked in white cashew gravy which went superbly with the butter nan. The balti mutton was tender and juicy and was served in a small bucket. The dal dhaba was a stunner. The butter chicken and paneer makkhan marke were also great. The tawa prawns were perfectly cooked and were juicy and tender. To end this delectable dinner we had five desserts namely badam halwa, rasmalai, phirni,gulab jamun and dhaba da meetha. Special mention for the dhaba da meetha which had layers of ice cream,rabdi and gulab jamun topped with nuts. Heavenly!  They also have buffet menu during lunch hours. The food is authentic and made with a lot of love and care. Surely not to be missed."
4.0,Food is delicious! They have a lot of variety.. The ambience is good too.. Decent place to chill out with friends or for a formal office Team lunch/dinner. Service is awesome.
4.5,"Ive been working in an IT company for over 3 years now and one primary source of entertainment for us folks are the traditionally hosted Team outings which in most cases end up in a restaurant! Adding more salt to the wound is when youre office is in typical localities, i.e around Whitefield or Marathahalli. So after trying out almost all the eateries in these localities in the form of various types of visits  via office, on my own and blog coverage, there was a period of lul. Not many interesting options were left, and then when I heard the news that Dhaba is opening in Marathahalli, I was like okay this is something that I need to check out as my previous two visits to their Indiranagar outlet were so so good. This 30-year-old brand from Delhi has been expanding gradually and this is their 9th outlet in India, and second in Bangalore.                                                                 ...Read full post on grubitizer.com"
4.5,Good place nice music awesome ambiance and caring staff in brief..  Food is no doubt lip smacking however I felt it was less in quantity ..do try their veg galouti kebab ..it was for some 320+ but had hardly 4 pieces in it ..  I was quite impressed with their drinks menu especially the tharra part :p  Only advice to management is they work on quantity of food 0.5 less only for this reason otherwise u guys are 10 on 10
5.0,"Went for the dinner with family. Lovely ambience and very delicious food. Really liked the starters. Dal is a specialty and so do the mock tails. Overall, very good service, food and decor."
4.5,"Awesome authentic North Indian food in Bangalore. Had    ,   ,  ,  , and    Despite an initial hiccup of being served wrong dish, which was corrected promptly, everything served was delicious. In fact, food tasted better here than Dhaba in Indiranagar."
4.5,An amazing place for punjabi food..do try it out..  Must try food items: Dal makhni Pindi chole Mirchi kulcha Makki roti and sarsoan ka saag Thandai Lassi Gulkand lassi Paneer tikka  Detailed review out in few days                                                                  instagram.com
4.5,Yet another restaurant among the numerous ones that dot the outer ring road. However for a change it is a little different. Not a buffet based one or a Hyderabadi cuisine.  We decided to try a ala carte menu. However it might be value for money if you try the buffet spread.  For the drinks we had the virgin pan mojito. This was a different take on the mojito and worth having it once. Then for the mains we had saag and Bhindi and  both were well prepared. The aloo Paratha was the best with a nice amount of filling exactly how the Paratha should be. We also had another Paratha and it went well with the curries ordered.  For the deserts we ordered rasmalai and again it was good.  The service was good but the place was a little loud. Also the dance by waiters was different but then the music was too loud for the small place.  The ambience was good and definitely recommended. Would visit again for having the buffet and that too non veg.
5.0,Must Try!!  Luscious food. Went for Sunday lunch with friends. Live gazal added more flavour to the food. Feels like you r in s dhaba with funky captions with Punjabi slangs words. Perfect place for the peoples who are looking for some good North Indian cuisine. Ambience- 5  Food- 5  Service- 5
4.0,"""When baking, go by directions. When cooking, go by your own taste- Laiko Bahrs So, it really wasn't a surprise when i immersed and imbibed myself in the meal put ahead of me. While my feet tapped to ""Ankhiyon se Goli Mare"", my belly started adding girth, just because i couldn't stop myself from taking that extra bite.  ______________________________________________ About Dhaba-Estd.1986 : Dhaba, is your ""I-want-some-hearty-punjabi-food "" kinda place. The place is filled with vibrancy and concentrates on simple and fulfilling punjabi dishes. The restaurant is set up in a very ""Dhaba"" aka roadhouse kind of a way. They propagate the raw finesse of North Indian cuisine.  Ambiance & Decor : The decor, is reminiscent of a Dhaba with loud and vibrant colour scheme. The pops of yellow and red and blue are ever so welcoming. The ambiance just like the decor, is an amalgamation of peppy and buoyant.  Hospitality: I've had my fair share of restaurant hopping everywhere and hospitality is something that makes or breaks the meal. I, found Dhaba to have an immaculate staff, that kept us accompanied with quick service and a helpful demeanour. Special mention to ""Mr. Asit"", who was a great ""serveur"" indeed.  The Grub Story : The beauty of this meal was the way it flowed from one course to another. They also, have the #SardiWedsPunjabiKhana winter menu on, which will run till the end of February.  Here's what me and the mister had :  Gulabo Lassi : Certainly the kinda cooler you need to commence your appetite. Flavoured with delicious & gritty gulkhand, i adored this lassi. Choti Glassiyan : A well thought assortment of their signature mocktails. Shikanji, Aam Panna, Ganne ka Ras, etc. This way, there is always something for someone. Tandoori Bhune Aloo : The warmth of those tandoored baby potatoes, still lingers on my palate. What an excellent plate of spicy, sweet and starchy flavours. Highly recommended. Mushroom Hara Pyaza : Mushrooms have always been my favourite and I love them more so, when they are tossed in masalas. This one was high on the hotness meter and had an explosive burst of mirchi. Not my kind, but certainly will please a spicy palate. Dhaba Paneer Tikka : I kid you, not! This was one of the best Paneer Tikka's I've had. Period. The succulent cubes of Paneer had the most amazing texture coupled with the spices that weren't overpowering at all. Your fork, melted into the cube, no resistance from the Paneer. Bravo! Tandoori Dhaba Raan: While the mister, dug into his plate of meat, the way his eyes lit up says a lot. According to him, the meat was just tender, falling off the bone. Marinated so beautifully that the spices penetrated and had been tenderised by an imam dasta. When asked, the matre d' said the baby lamb leg was left to marinate overnight and given a double fry treatment. The non vegetarian soul, must try this.Murgh Malai Tikka : Another, delicately spiced and well tandoored dish, which got a yes, from the mister. Sarson ka Saag: There is never a time, that i do not crave some Sarson ka saag. I had to have it, as it was on the winter menu and trust me.. I was smiling ear to ear. The flavour profile was earthy with the pungency of garlic and the heartiness of the pured leafy greens. Coupled with Makkai ki Roti, this was match made in the realms of the connoisseurs heaven. Dilli ki Nihari : Light and unabashed. The Nihari was a hybrid of laal maas and Rarra gosht. Very surprisingly, it wasn't a heavy goopy mess rather it was a light and went well with rotis. (as told by mister) Matka Kulfi : Sprinkled generously with bits of pistachios and almonds, the kulfi was a perfect way to end the meal. ______________________________________Verdict : The food, really does do a good job and delivers to your expectations. The Dhaba Paneer Tikka was one of the best & I can vouch for it. The menu is vast and has a carefully selected variation of dishes that personify a Dhaba. I, would definitely recommend.                                             theplatememoirs.wordpress.com"

4.5,"Dhaba, a venture from Delhi, after running successfully in Indiranagar is now welcomed by Marathalli & one cannot be any more excited. The typical Punjabi feels is all that you need right now!  Located above @home, the place is easy to locate, is beyond beautiful and has got great vibes. I was enlighted to see so many quotes and saying up on the wall with lit frames. Tickles you tummy & the tastebuds well.  As I sat and decided as to what to order for food, my eyes kept running around to make sure no beauty gets unnoticed. Such a treat to the eyes I tell you!   So we ordered a couple of drinks and the starters for the hungry souls. I took the first bite of Veg Galouti kabab & believe me was astonished to find out its veg. Spicy and flavorful kabab, never thought veg could be so lit.  Chicken Takatak was a spicy chicken delicacy with juicy and succulent chicken chunks. Went well with the green chutney.  I only eat chicken but my friends did love Amristsari machi & Tawa Prawns.  Among the mocktails, we started off with Choti Glassiyan which was a cute mini lorry with 6 different drinks as testers in cute lil glasses. Ganne ka Sa Ras Shikanji, Paan Mojito, Jaljeera, Kala khatta,   Rangeela & Aam Panna were a part of it & I just loved the Paan mojito. Refreshing drink after a tiring day goes well with the food too.  Before the main course arrived, loud music kicked in & we realized it is a flash mob by the Dhaba team. The waiters & the managers join in together to give a stupendous dance performance. The crowd was filled with this infinite energy and we couldnt stop but cheer em. Truly what you need after a stressful day   Coming to the main course, I was half full & still wanted to try the main course. We had butter chicken, Chitti gobi, Balti mutton, Dal Makhani & Lehsun paneer. The butter chicken was a star. I ordered roomali roti along and I just loved this combo. The main course were amazing however I felt Chitti gobi and Lehsuni paneer were average. Rest of the curries were delectable.  Now comes the most interesting part  Desserts. Stomach too full, but dont worry ya! This goes to the heart :D   Badam halwa, Rasmalai, Shahi tookda & Rabri, could it be any more awesome? Rasmalai here is a must try & you make sure you dont miss it.  The place is a must try, super LIT, has great ambiance & commendable staff & service. You will be bestowed by the food.

4.0,"Went for a Sunday dinner with friends. Strategically located above @home. Pretty decked up place. Cool songs. Very good and fast service. The food was pretty good. Spread of food and alcohol is fairly big. Tried the classic butter chicken with butter nan, virgin ""pan"" mojito. So here goes my view: Ambiance 10/10 Service 10/10 Quality of food 10/10 Quantity 7/10. My only advice to the management.... You may want to reconsider the quantity of food served..."
3.0,"Ambiance and food quality is nice. 1 thing which disappointed us the most is the price. The place is unnecessarily over priced in comparison to the ambiance, food quality and quantity. One can easily get the similar kind of taste, quantity and ambiance in half price in other restaurants in Bangalore. I hope the restaurant people will look into the price issue."
5.0,"If you are a real foodie, you can try this place. They have a very good food and drinks menu for both buffet and ala la carte with full of Punjabi music. It's a wonderful place with an awesome ambiance. This place reminds of Bathinda food with Sardaar Ji wala feeling."

4.0,"Bangalore, Buffet place, Dhaba, Dhaba - Estd 1986 Delhi, Indian food, Indiranagar, Marathahalli, Punjabi Food. We had our pre New Years eve gathering at the newly opened Marathahalli outlet of Dhaba Estd 1986 Delhi last week. The place was done up with bright interiors, very peppy and true to its theme. We were seated across from the very nice looking bar, quite a tantalizing view considering we were saving the actual drinking for the next evening. The menu is segregated into Theka (booze) and Khana (grub). Dhaba also has a promotional #SardiWedsPunjaabiKhana winter special available until end of Feb featuring the some promosing proteins and saag dishes.

4.5,"""We are Punjabis, aapa calm coom Ni hunde""  - and on this note il start off with my first review of 2018.  The famous chain of restaurant from Delhi, Dhaba by Claridges or Dhaba as popularly known, has launched its second outlet in Bangalore. Located amidst the bustling IT hub in Marathahalli it is surely gonna be a crowd puller soon. I was here for dinner on a weekday with few of my foodie friends.  AMBIANCE -  It is situated on the fourth floor of the HoMe Centre building. The place has this happy vibe to it which grabs your attention the moment you step in. The interiors are done beautifully with vibrant walls having witty punju quotes. The bar counter is also extremely smartly designed. The music with popular Bollywood numbers also nicely blends with the ambiance.  FOOD -  To me Indian Food is comfort food and Dhaba rightfully served the purpose of 'Ghar ka Khana' for me that evening. We were a group of 4 hardcore non- vegetarians. We started off with the Choti Glassiyan which was an assortment of their popular mocktails. After a hectic day at work, the Ganne ka Sa Ras Shikanji and Paan Mojito rightfully quenched our thirsts.  Starters included -  -Amritsari Machchi - My personal favourite. The quality of fish used was extremely good. Also it had just the right amount of ajwain.  -Chicken Takatak - Highly reccomended for the murgh lovers. As the name suggests it's little bit on the spicier side.  -Veg Galouti Kebab - Never knew even veg kebab could be so delicious. Its an absolute - melt in your mouth - item. Must try!  -Tawa Prawns - The presentation of this dish was mind-blowing. It had jumbo sized tiger prawns in yellow chillie and hung curd marination. My friends found the fish a bit undercooked but it tasted perfect for me.  For the Main Course we had -  Balti Meat - This is their signature dish. The concept of serving the meat in a mini bucket is indeed unique. The meat was tender and the gravy was really good in taste. .  Dal - Reminded of maa ki daal in the truest sense.  Lehsuni Paaner - This could have been little better. Found a bit bland in terms of taste.  Last but not the least we put a perfect end to the meal with badam halwa, rasmalai , shahi tukda and Rabri. The shahi tukda and rasmalai in particular are a must try !  SERVICE-  Extremely amicable staff and very prompt in service. They are quite well versed with the menu and also gave their inputs on ordering. Something which took us by surprise is that they broke into an impromptu jig all of a sudden. This actually livened up the mood.  Overall-  Be it for a team lunch or a family get together or even a dinner date with friends, this place is ideal for all the aspects.  Keep up the good work guys! Bon appetite :)"

Visited here last week with a couple of friends and was amazed by their great service, tasty food and awesome dance.                                                                 foodnwine.in"
4.5,"Dhaba Estd 1986 Delhi or Dhaba as I prefer to call is on the 1st floor of the @home building on marathalli service road. When you hear the name dhaba you imagine soulful food, authentic flavours, lots of fresh and flavorful ingredients all cooked with skilled cooks. This place is exactly what all of that is.  I had the privilege to visit this place 2-3 days after their Grand Opening and below is m 4th short review and must haves from the place  Ambience: the designers have taken elements of Dhaba and tastefully mixed it up with humorous Punjabi words which give you a feel of a modern Punjabi Dhaba. The place is colourful, well lit and beautiful.  Service: Well informed, courteous and attentive staff. Quick service and the best part is the little dance number that the staff does for you while you are enjoying your food.  Food: Great flavours, fresh ingredients, skilled presentation and amazing textures.  Price: Price is ranged avg of 300-350 Rs across dishes and buffet comes up to 600/person.  Must Try: Dhaba dal, Balti murgh , butter chicken, Amritsari macho, shahi tukda with gulab jamoon and rabri."
1.5,"For  la carte , it's the worst place  to have Punjabi food.Too costly for the taste and quantity they give. Ambiance is fine. But still ,not worth paying 215rs for lemon soda."
2.0,The food was just about ok but unusually expensive. If certain items cost upwards of 400 it better be of excellent quality which it wasn't. Maybe the buffet would be nice but a la carte wasn't. Disappointed with the experience.
4.5,"This amazing punjabi restaurant is now come to Marathahalli. Simplifying the cuisine, they have taken dishes to new levels of taste, ambience and service. We tried some great starters, murg malai tikka for one was smooth and interesting. Done to perfection and just wow. Equally good was the paneer dishes which are absolutely succulent and tasty. Any gravy will go along the wonderful breadbasket that they serve. Try the different ones before you make your favourite choice. But do let some space for desert. For all those who love Indian deserts, you people will be on a joy ride. For those who are not, this place with its phirni, Rasmalai, Rasogullas will just make you an Indian sweet person. Their buffet option are the new talk of the town, and much easier way of trying their spread and making your choice."
4.0,"Lovely place for some lip smacking Punjabi food. We were here for a weekday dinner, and tried couple of the dishes recommended by the restaurant manager.   Must say, the staff is well versed about the likes of combos and very patiently handled our queries.   What we had: masala papad, amritsari fish tikka, balti mutton, dal makhni, amritsari chole,s Saarson da saag, makke ki roti,  gazar halwa, and rabri.  Good food, VFM. Will be back for more soon."
4.5,"The quintessential North Indian restaurant, Dhaba serves authentic Punjabi/North Indian food with utmost love and care. The ambience is really quirky and makes for great photo opportunities! Absolutely lip smacking starters, to-die-for butter chicken, dal makhani and the heavenly, almost surreal phirni and rosogulla. Definitely going for it the next time. Extremely happy with the service. Kudos team!"
4.5,"Went here on a team lunch and was surprised by every single bit of the restaurant.  Ambience - 4 Staff - 5 Variety - 5 Taste - 4  We were served 12 varieties of starters - 6 veg and 6 non veg And all of them were either good or just too finger licking.  The best was papdi chat and lauki halwa. Just loved them both. The best I have ever had.  With decent pricing considering the rates elsewhere, I would suggest visiting this place for buffet as A la cart is expensive."
4.0,"Great ambience, delicious food, good bollywood music and polite staff. Nice place for lunch / dinner with office colleagues. Thank you Dhaba Estd 1986 Delhi."
3.0,"Been to this outlet for having a dinner with my friends. The ambience of the restaurant is decent. Its bollywood theme. There is a live music too. Which was pretty good. Coming to the food, had tried Amritsar Malai Chicken, Fish, Paneer, dry fruit Lassi. Malai Chicken was good in taste. The presentation of the foods arent great. Coming to the taste it was okay.  all items were served at perfect temperature but few fish items were not served at perfect temperature. The efficiency of the service wasnt good."
4.5,It's authentic Punjabi and Delhi style food. Starters are so yummy. Pani Puri And pappadi chat are delicious. Aam ka pani is  very tasty. Rice item has veg pulav it had normal taste. Chains chat is amazing taste. Lassi taste s is super. They add jeera it's give taste more.
4.5,"Dhabha ESTD 1986 Delhi  Unrivalled place to relish Punjabi food!  A popular chain of restaurants from Delhi - that has opened up doors in Bangalore an year ago - and this one being their second outlet at outer ring road Marathahalli .  This outlet is quite different from their counterpart.  Dhabha  mainly focuses of Punjabi and North Indian cuisine.  The names in menu are quirky.  Paid a visit for the dinner - as I always preferred to have those specially curated dishes rather than going for a regular buffet.  Ambiance 4.5/5  Native and casual dcor  well lit place  But would for sure leave a lasting impact  loved the quirky quotes on the walls.  Babaji ka painting on the wall , Punjabi one liners and the Sprite Mirinda bottles kept on one corner, matkas  (earthen pots) used for lassi and water.  Even the old Bollywood posters on the walls at the washroom area noteworthy  We have tables for small groups and also private dining space on one corner, which can be let out as private dining space to large groups!  Highlight of this place#  They even have live singing performances on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night.  And this for sure adds up to charm of this place.  The staff performs a 2 minute dance performance on hit Bollywood numbers which is again entertaining to the crowd.  Food 4.5/5  Went there with a group of friends and we all had a whale of time  So we had tried various dishes from their menu  For beverages  we tried the Mango Lassi, Kaala khatta, Aampana, Gulkand lassi, sweet lassi, masala chaas, Jal jeera  I loved the Gulkand Lassi and sweet lassi  which were served in kulhads  The gulkand used in lassi was apt and it gave it a unique flavor all together.  Jal jeera was a bit too strong.  Non veg starters   The show stealer here was Amritsari fish tikka   Boy the flavors were balanced to perfection and the ajwain added over along with the batter coated over the fish was simply finger licking good.  Mutton raan  a must try for all mutton lovers out there!  This is their USP dish according to me  lamb leg pieces marinated overnight and cooked for a long time over tandoor and then served along with some shaurva , the meat was soft and had the right amount of flavors added to it, it was topnotch.  Veg starters  Dhabha Paneer tikka was perfect  Aloo kurkure was crispy and the mint chutney was fab   Non Veg main course:-   Dhabhe ki roti , Butter naan , Butter chicken , Mutter paneer ki sabzi , Kofta curry and Chicken Biryani  Loved the Butter chicken  it had slight sweetness quo and tasted yumm, no artificial color or flavors used , they made sure the dish is fabulous.  The tender chicken pieces cooked along with butter and cream did the trick.  Dhabhe ki roti is unique in terms of taste and goes well with Kofta curry, do give it a try.  Service -4.5/5 The staff are really polite and they do their best to make sure one has a surreal experience. They never give us a chance to complain about anything. They are attentive and alert and they always have a warm smile and are ready to correct upon things if any one has issues .  VFM  4.5/5 Prices are slightly high, cost for two without alcohol would come up to 1800++tax  But they would for sure suffice the dearth of the price by Quality of food, taste and quantity.  Their quality of ingredients used is worth a special mention, they use mostly rustic spices and dont add any artificial colors, this can be sensed in dish like Butter chicken (where most of them use the food color) but Dhabha Team and chefs in here make it as authentic as possible.  If you are in search of a new place  may be team lunch, dinner with friends or Family this is the place to be , Im sure Team Dhabha Estd 1986 would make your day memorable.  Will come back for sure  on a Sunday where in I can sit back relax and listen to those classic Bollywood numbers and then relish my meal along with my family .  Kudos to the entire team Dhabha Estd 1986 for making us feel special and not to forget - for such a gastronomical experience that is so special!                                             krantiawelltravelledgourmand.wordpress.com"
5.0,"In banglore for few days...  So I planned to visit  this place..  As I have seen there other outlets in Delhi... And I must say they are really doing a great job  here in banglore as well...  The food was amazing,  staff is very courteous and special thanks to Sanjay Roy and keep rocking"
4.0,"Bored of the same place to dine with your team, colleagues, friends? Well, I was and that's when I heard about The dhaba opening up in Marathahalli and landed here once they had opened doors to mango people..  For the bhukkhad that we are, the whole gang went for the buffet which has both veg and non veg options. Almost around 10-14 starters combining veg and non veg and then the chaat corner .. followed by the main course and finally for the sweet tooth some meetha..  For the price they are charging the food quality is amazing and quantity as well. Love the interiors .. as it's bright and vibrant walls. Check this place out and you can also check my pictures for a peekaboo   Taste: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Rate: worth every penny that we have paid. You can find the details on their zomato account or FB page Recommendation: Dal Makhani, Butter chicken, Mutton curry in al carte but if you're going in for buffet then lookout for these dishes..   They also serve alcohol, cocktails and mocktails hence it's a good option for corporates as we have a very limited option in and around Marathahalli to go for team outing or dine-in. lemonytales.com"
5.0,"Loved the food , music and ambience. This is one of it's kind . Pritam and Ajoy were the best hosts I have met at any buffet place. They have variety of starters in both veg and non veg section  will strongly refer it for a buffet."
5.0,"We visited the place on a Thursday. There menu has uncountable veg and non-veg starters. Generally places have only varied non-veg dishes. But here the number of veg starters were almost equal that also around 10-11. So, the place is good both in the quantity and quality of food. The dal makhani, chat and everything was superb. Adding to the yummy food was the excellent music and the service of the staff. Its a great and a must place to visit if you are craving for good north India dhaba food."
3.5,"The place has got quite a huge menu. I got to eat only the starters and desserts along with some amazing Lassi and mocktails.  Had various starters served on my plate and the soya chops we're absolutely amazing and I have never had anything like that followed by the amazing veg kebabs..  The Pani Puri, sev Puri and the others chats to we're filling not because of the quantity but the dishes were that many!  Also ordered the regular Lassi and the gulabi Lassi! The gulabi Lassi is infused with gulkhan and I don't think it went that well though it was worth a try.  Then headed to the desserts to find moong dal ka halwa, phirni and jamoons. Was disappointed with the halwa and phirni as both of them tasted bland and I had quite some expectations after tasting their amazing starters.  Some of my friends also ordered the Indi Creed cocktails and thoroughly enjoyed them!!!"
4.5,"An ambiance that is desi yet has a modern touch, all enthusiastic crew and ever ready to serve you, music to beat the days' stress out, occasional dance by the staff to keep you entertained, and dhamakedar food this is what exactly Dhaba offers you in nutshell. This 30+-year-old restaurant opened its outlet at Marathahalli Bangalore in the midst of the IT valley and a perfect treat for the crowd working nearby. The menu is quite spread out and has choices to spoil you. I was here for a dinner along with my colleagues and it was indeed a much-needed dinner trip after those late working hours, and Dhaba left us all full and happy.  Mango Lassi, Shrikanji, Kala katta, Jal jeera were all gulped down by us, I literally lost the count of glasses. Amritsari Macchi, one of the best places to eat this dish in town.  Chicken and mutton tak a tak, much loved and salivating dish. Tandoori Prawn, a must try, marinated with yellow chili and hung curd. Tandoori Dhaba Raan, tender lamb leg marinated well and looks like their hot selling dish, since I saw every table ordering it. Bhindi Masala and Paneer tak a tak are few veg starters I would recommend. After this heavy dose of starters, we could only manage to eat Biryani for main course and needless to say it was just the thing we needed.   Kulfi, piping hot and soft gulab jamoon, phirni is not be missed here for dessert lovers. Planning for a team dinner, family eat out, or simply want to eat some home like food, Dhaba should be your first choice.  Thank you, Dhaba for the great hospitality.                                             myhungertales.wordpress.com"

4.5,"Great ambience, awesome food taste. Items are bit less, but considering ambience ,taste and charges its more then worth to go there. It will be unfair if we don't mention the customer service/politeness staff is having."
4.0,"Food : 8/10 Ambience : 7/10 Service : 7/ 10 VFM :7/10  I went to this place with my colleague for an elaborate lunch buffet and trust me i just stuffed myself like anything.Not only because of i was hungry   enough but the food was also superb . Typical northy style parathas,lassi,sarson sag,kebabs,yellow 1dal,chicken malai gravy,papri chat,pani puri my favourite Delhi style and etc..etc...etc.There were so many dishes i can't mention the entire list (plz check the photos posted) I should mention the service part, they showed  the best possible way of it & the dance just added an extra flavour on our fun filled lunch buffet . Ambience is rightly created for a dhaba look.You can really check out this place with your folks but yes please go with a really hungry belly cause the variety & amount  of food they serve you will end up with having half of it.I will give 7 out of 10 to this place Dhaba"
