Rating,Review
1.0,I was so excited to visit this place for its food and ambience but I was super disappointed. The ambience is so sad and the service is even worse. And obviously lets not talk about the food! I dont think I would ever recommend this place to anyone.
1.0,Its a worst place to visit now. In a month it happened twice that after waiting for 1 n half hour i have to walk out. It has deteriorated in its service
4.0,"Silbatti is one the best North Indian cuisine restaurants in HSR. I have been here several times and the place never disappoints me. You must try the appetisers here. Pesto paneer, Bharwan kumbh, murgh Reshmi kebab are a few.  Based upon the crowd do be patient however the wait is definitely worth it."
3.0,"Polite staff , nice ambience, veg dishes are pretty good but non veg starters are not up to the mark. It's dry and too oily. Its not suitable if it's raining. The place is full of mosquitoes."
2.0,"Food - 1/5 Service -2/5 Price - 2/5  Ordered shahi butter chicken , mushroom cigars. Shahi butter chicken was simply tomato pury chicken. Overhyped place ."
1.0,Did not provided one plus on zomato even after zomato gold membership. Staff was non corporative and was impolite. In case of left over food was not reasy to pack it as well.

5.0,We went here for a team dinner. The starters were delicious. For main course we ordered multiple dishes and them all to be pretty good. The ambience is a nice one. They play music that adds a good vibe to the atmosphere. Really enjoyed our time here. Will recommend this place.
5.0,"Amazing place to be. Choicest place for Punjabi food. Super fantastic. It was great ambience, nice people. Amazing staff and great hygiene. Popular in entire Bangalore."
5.0,"Food taste is really great specially tandoori item,must visit for all. Came here with family and really enjoyed the food,looking forward for another time"
5.0,This was a nice place to hangout. Good food and drinks. I would recommend couples /family to visit the place. Especially the roti items are very good
1.0,"Service is very poor . Food served taste was not that good . If you want to go then go at your risk. No one care there whether you have ordered or not , whether your item are served or not or how much quantity that have been ordered"
3.0,Visited this place second time last month and its a decent place to have dinner with friends or family. Nothing wow about it but nothing bad also. Portion wise good but taste can be slightly better.  Ambience: 4/5 Food: 3.5/5 Service: 3/5
1.0,"Waiting for breads for past 45 minutes. Very poor service, be prepared to eat cold dishes if you are coming here. Staff here will not listen to you. Good luck for stuggle."
3.0,Food was nice but the service was poor. It took 45 mins for the second round of breads to arrive. All and all the place was okay. Service was the biggest drawback.
1.0,Waiting of half and hour and more inspite of asking again and again..added irritation by mosquitoes..Then more disappointment is with food..Fulkas are very thick and not cooked properly..paneer masala was only Mirchi powder gravy no taste..no Ingredients..Total disappointment.Dont waste time going here
4.0,"Value for money, good food, only negative thing is that you have to wait for a long time for you order which is very irritating. But I would definitely recomand this place for anyone who does not have a problem with waiting"
2.0,The ambiance was actually good  When we come to starturs lollipop chicken was good  Biriyani was very bad  . Working staff was nt responding properly
4.0,A good place to try with family/ friends but plan during dinner time as it may be hot during lunch hours cause of their seating arrangement. Taste of the food was good. Vegetarian starters and curries were good in taste and serving was also quick. Khatiya arrangement is also quite comforty. Please book in advance during weekend to avoid long waiting lines.
1.0,It's for about 15-20mins we waited and no one has turned up to take an order. Over to all it was a best mosquito house..one star is just for it's ambience.....so disappointing experience...
1.0,Very bad experience.. food is cold over hyped restraurent. Bad customer service. We ordered veg kababs n it's cold no spoons on table etc after couple of times calling service guys they are responding.
3.0,"The place has a much sought after Indian village theme which is otherwise good but can be enhanced because most competitors around can put up better. Among what we ordered was Sweet Corn Sheek for starter which was okay and served with mint chutney. We also got roti and Paneer Lababdar served. The paneer dish was really good considering that it gave a not so conventional taste of paneer dishes available around. All in all, a decent place to go with your close ones for some decent North Indian taste."
1.0,"On my last visit they said food is over, that was just 11 pm that to Sunday. Kind of disappointed. I think they need to manage well, sometimes i have cold rotis due to limited staff."
3.0,"I would have given this place 3.7/5.0 . The food served here is really good. You can enjoy authentic North Indian here. The ambience gives you the feel of village which again adds to the experience. However, they do have water dripping problem in case it rains. Overall, food is really great."
3.0,Really good in terms of food. But really pathetic about service. I had to wait for really long time and they even missed the order and I had to check with the manager and get it sorted. Really DISAPPOINTED with the service.
4.0,Very nice food and ambiance. The service is very fast and good the only thing that need improvement is that on a hot day it is very difficult to sit with very limited fans around.
3.0,Had been to this resturant on a Sunday night with my friend. The ambience of this place is good with a dhaba setup being done. Firstly we ordered soup of the day - chicken. But to our disappointment it tasted like chicken gravy in a water form. And particularly it has 2 quite small pieces of chicken it was not even shredded. Seeing that we were scared to order much so ordered just one aloo and gobi paratha. Aloo Paratha was good but gobi paratha was not good..it has too much masala in it.  Lastly I felt that this place was understaffed. We had to make 3 to 4 calls each time we needed something. We asked for salt and pepper which was The serving people were jungling between tables which was quite dissapointing.
4.0,The menu tries to be inspiring but is really a good play of words on dishes you and I are accustomed to. I'd suppose they could use some more creativity in the dishes too. Not everything needs to be loaded with cream to make it delicious. It's a good old Indian trick that is very passe now and you need better tricks to impress the discerning customer.
2.0,"Average Place with Average Food. We ordered ginger coriander chicken, kasundi fish tikka, awadhi gosht biryani and naan/roti. Fish tikka was really bad with some unusual fish texture. I guess the fish was frozen for a long time. We felt as if we were eating chicken, it was that hard! Ginger coriander chicken was okay, better than others dishes. Awadhi gosht biryani had bad quality meat pieces. With just 2 pieces and bitter tasting meat, this was a total disaster. We returned this dish. To sum it up, there are way better places around HSR. Visit this at your own risk."
5.0,"I was impressed with the ambience they have. A lot of the staff is from the northeast who are more than courteous. Taste - 4/5 (paneer was hard to bite but my friend loved the laal maas, plus the lassis here are a must have) Ambience - 5/5 (felt more like an Indian setup and how an home environment should be) Service - 5/5 (cause they agreed to give us only soda with black salt to cool our taste buds when it is not available on their menu) Experience - 4/5 (May not have the cleanest washroom as most of the restaurants in Bangalore but the pleasant ambience makes you forget the negative instances)"
4.0,Bharwan kumbh and Awadhi aloo dum are the best in this place. Been here several times. Thursday movies are also good for a evening date here.
4.0,The food is an absolute delight to the senses! Vegetarian and non vegetarian are equally good. The space is cosy. Best to visit on a rainy evening! :)
3.0,"Visited this place for dinner with a friend over a weekday. This was our second time visiting this joint. While the experience we had the first time was good, which was about an year back, can't say the same about this time though. The ambience was as it was earlier though very poorly maintained. The tables were dusty and dirty and the staff wouldn't clean it. The food was decent, tasted okay and was served hot. We had Tomato shorba, dahi ke kebab, paneer subzi, and garlic naan. However, the major let down was the staff. They wouldn't take our order even after calling them repeatedly and once the order was placed they wouldn't serve us even after enquiring with them again and again how much time it would take. People that had entered the place after us ate and left while we were still sitting there hungry and waiting for our food. It was utterly disappointing. Definitely not visiting this place again."
1.0,First there is always waiting for 20-30 mins usually. But if you come down on any off day and at peak hours get ready to be ignored. We literally waited 30 mins just to get the table. We could not even get the starters in 50 mins after ordering. Such bad service and no communication from the staff is highly irritating. We left the place without having anything and wasting our 2 hours almost.
1.0,The food was really bad. It used to be so good earlier. Staff behaviour was not good. They were hardly interested in taking order. Panner was burnt and same condition with chicken. Wont suggest anyone to waste their money or time there.
5.0,"The place feels like a dhaba with interiors made to look like one. Food was surprisingly very good. Liked the chicken tikka, lal maas, roti and the chicken gravy. Pocket friendly prices. Surely worth a visit."
3.0,The place looks like a dhaba and the food was about average. Only the chicken biriyani was good. The pricing was average and not a very memorable visit.
3.0,Didn't live upto the expectations . Reasonable rates though. Seating could have been made little more comfy. Overall average experience. Shall try again another time to give a benefit of doubt.
3.0,"We visited with family on a Sunday for lunch. The ambience was quaint and charming and we had high hopes. However the service was snail paced. I echo the comment by another customer review that the staff looked dull, unhappy and as though they were being forced to work against their will. The food arrived after a very long wait by when we were ravenously hungry. The food as such was decent and quantities were sufficient. We ordered Chicken Dum Biryani, some rotis and a Palak Gosht. The Palak Gosht was a bit of a disappointment as the mutton pieces were all bony with very little actual meat. Another negative was that given the heat in the middle of the day, the giant pedestal fans were not enough to drive away the droves of flies that were all over the restaurant (atleast the area where we were sat). Worth a visit but not more probably in my opinion. 3 stars mainly for the service and the flies."
4.0,A nice restaurant. I tried Chicken Briyani. They gave it in a big pot. Taste was so nice. Briyani had so many Chicken pieces. I carried parcel for the left over Briyani.
5.0,The food is good but the service is slow. Sitting arrangements is also lovely and good. It's location is also good and precise from offices.
4.0,Food was good so as the taste But have to wait in queue for half an hour for the table. Service-This was a bit disapponting.It was slow and the waiters looked confused.
1.0,The quality of food as well as service has deteriorated drastically. Not a single food item was of eatable quality. I would never recommend visiting this restaurant.
3.0,"We didnt have a reservation, so had to wait for 15 mins to get a table. Food was ok, portion size was amble, couple of dishes were good. Good setting and nice music as well. On the flip side, service was quite slow, we had to remind them a couple of times for ordered dishes as well. There were no queries about how the food was or whether we would like additional items. Being an open place, mosquitoes were a problem too."
4.0,"Love this place , I bean to there countless time. It's like always find a reason to go and eat there. Love the ambiance,food quality same last 3 year. Even the concept watching cricket and eating good is awesome. People are very helpful. Most time ,my son will change siting location one or 2 times. Even if it's crowded, they try to accommodate. You must try tanduri chicken, dal makhni. They ar not good in biryani."
2.0,Too many mosquitoes. Could not sit at all. Food was good but they need to do something for the mosquitoes. We were getting mosquito bites throughout our dinner and wanted to just go away .Have informed the staff as well
5.0,"Best place to hang out with friends and family. Staff is very nice. We had soup,non-veg starters and biriyani in main course. The starters were really good.. pepper chicken and masala chicken were yummi. Murgh biriyani also was good.. The raita they served with the biriyani was best. The ambience is also good. Music was pleasant."
1.0,"Ambience is okayish, service is poor, food is below expectations, rates are way beyond average, good place for couples to ruin their Sunday mood.  PS: It used to be a nice place before."
2.0,Food n ambiance is good .. but the service is pathetic.. even water served after 20 mins n day too after several requests..main course took another 30 mins to be placed on table.  Visit only of if u have time n patience
3.0,"Food is ok, ambience is good but not a budget friendly restaurant. Per head Avg ~450 (nonveg). Small glass of Lassi cost you 100 Rs. But Lassi is good. Veg dishes are ok nothing to say special about."
2.0,Food was average and not upto the mark. Cold drinks are too expensive. They charge 75 bucks for low quality lime water. Sitting arrangements are difficult to eat. Completely disappointed.
1.0,Worst place worst service. Half an hour for extra roti and at the end they said Kitchen close.  Worst place worst service. Half an hour for extra roti and at the end they said Kitchen close.
4.0,"Nice food, Nice ambiance Good service.  Good place for Vegetarian's, quantity they serve is adequate for 2 people.  I would definitely recommend to visit."
2.0,"We came here on Sunday at 3:20pm and the welcome that we got at the entrance was ""It's closed as the food is finished"" which really pissed me of. And yes the timings for Friday-Sunday are 12Noon - 4PM. Such a bad experience!!!"
5.0,Excellent food and superb service place is open to air little bamboo work hut and shades in between and the service people are good but it takes a little time to get food but still since quality is good and staff is polite and humble I would recommend it to go with family or friends nice dinner destination ....
1.0,Very bad service and they don't even attend to there customers also ... We had to wait for a hour to get the food and they have they don't value for time of customer
2.0,"Decent food. Time taken to serve food was very long. Service personnel was very cold. For the cost, the value is not seen. All things on Menu are not available"
5.0,Awesome place to eat. Enjoyed the meal so much. We ordered kumbh mutter and the mushroom in it was sized large and tasted very good. The paneer kulcha and oudina paratha we ordered was good too. Panneer kulcha was very aoft and tasty. A must stop place!!!
4.0,"Sort of a dhaba kind of ambience with good food. Hygiene needs to be improved. The chicken tikka, biriyani and the rotis were all good. Curry was okay. Pocket friendly place worth visiting."
2.0,The Food quality was okay. Service was very slow and had to ask many times for our food. Our daal was cold while waiting for Jeera rice.Ambience of the restaurant was okay.
1.0,Going by Zomato rating we visited this place but it was not as expected. Place is crowded and service is very slow. Many items from menu were not available. Even the taste was not at all good. Dahi k kebabs were horrible.
5.0,"Ambience is a relatable to dhaba. You'll enjoy a different experience. Food quality, taste and quantity is adequate for the price. Staff are really friendly."
4.0,Nice place to chill with your friends. Good food. I went with my office colleagues and it was a good experience. Ambience is ok and waiters do take carevof your orders
3.0,"One of the unique, decent and budget friendly restaurant in HSR, ambience is good ,Food quality can be improved. Service is also fine..overall good restaurant ,can try once,if ur staying near by."
3.0,"Decent ambience. Some nice non veg dishes like the chicken vindaloo and mutton rogan josh. Otherwise it was quite forgettable experience, nothing worth raving about."
4.0,Great ambience. Loved the lassi. The curries were just ok. Mutton rogan gosh didn't impress me. Zomato gold partnership is an added advantage Overall a good restaurant .
2.0,Been there last night interested looking at the ambience. Like the ambience though. Food was not as loon as the ambience we were three families and none of liked any of the dishes. Slightly over priced.  They had a common base for all the menus and every dish was tasting same unfortunately.
1.0,Service is okay but highly understaffed. Paneer items were hopeless.  Only good things are cold drinks and Pan served outside the restaurant.
2.0,Made me to wait for very long. Always loved to go till the last visit. now service has come down drastically food is not good quality. Service staff needs to be educated untrained & rude waiter/waitress.
4.0,innovative decor. Decent North Indian food. The place does not have AC and gets very difficult to eat during summer afternoon. Some of the staff is courteous while others can't understand English or hindi. You should try once to experience a different way of dining.
3.0,The food is average and the place is also average. Serving is good. The guys are good there. They are polite and helpful. They will serve also.
4.0,"Family restaurant, good taste and good service... Loved Pav bhaji and samosa there. Great place for having north Indian snacks and chats...."
2.0,"It is a very ok place for lunch or dinner. Has earthly flavour in terms of their decor and seating arrangements. The food is average and if you have nowhere else to go around. Quantity is good and yes, this place is on Gold :) Things which went wrong were food & staff - who were bit confused, not smiling and looked forced to work kind. We ordered Veg galouti kebab which was rough and very dry. We could get pieces of vegetables whereas the galouti kebabs has to be minced properly and are supposed to be melting in the mouth. Chicken and paneer has the same gravy and tasted the same. Orange drink was good which helped us to finish what we ordered. We weren't expecting something wow here but the we were sure expecting a decent taste from food and a pleasant staff support - both of which were missing at Silbatti.  We went for lunch so cant comment on the ambience much, but I am sure this place must be beautiful in the evenings with lights and music. But i guess i will never know as this is not a place to be visited again! for me."
1.0,"I was a big silbatti fan, but I would say I was... The food quality and taste has degraded. Only one star that too for ambience and starter was okayish"
4.0,Food was Good.... Service is little slow.... Good place for groups and families. Village style ambience . Good option for both veg and non veg..........
4.0,"Visited this place for dinner. It has that cozy ambience with few katiya to sit. You see lot of families arriving. Nice ambience. Might be bit crowded some times. It's a Punjabi themed place. We had ordered chicken platter. Chicken Tikka, roti n chicken gravy. Everything tasted good. And so was the service. A perfect dinner or lunch place with family and friends. Would love to visit again."
5.0,"awesome food. I love this place. keeps on coming once or twice every month. Love the environment, price and food. Must visit for dinner. Awesomeness. thanks"
3.0,Pretty decent ambience for a lunch/dinner setting. The place seemed cozy and had good service. They could think of working on the food quality though. The food tasted pretty average and missed out on the mughlai feel.
1.0,The waiting time is too long. Service is bad. Though the food quality is good again if the service is not good everything gon a be waste. If you are visiting this place on Friday please take some lumsum time to come to the restaurant.
3.0,"Ambience is nice. There was a foul smell just outside the restaurant. We ordered tandoori chicken, tandoori prawn, nun, rice, palak paneer, chicken vindaloo, Lal mass, ice-cream. Starters were fine but main course must say not upto the mark. They must look into their recipes again. Decent pricing. I guess they don't have a bar yet."
3.0,Been here with the group of friends... 11 people to be exact... Its affordable place...  Didn't find much of difference b/w the paneer tikka & achari paneer tikka..... Stff is friendly..... Food is quite tasty... Though quantity is not upto the expectation.... Delay is pretty long comparetively... My original rating would be 4 but reduced one Becuase of the - ve points...
5.0,"Dinner confusion?  Please go to this place for some amazing food. Though it be veg or non-veg, its yummy! Must try Chicken lollipop for non-vegetarians and Kadai paneer for vegetarians!"
3.0,Staff was courteous and food was good. Seating was baded on a dhaba theme. A good experience but the only reason for less stars is that for pure vegetarians the smell of the non veg coming from the kitchen was too much to bear...
1.0,"We came for Dinner with family and were quite disappointed with their service. We were like waiting for eternity for the main course to come. Ambience is fine but could be better. We ordered baigan ka bharta, dal makhni, zafrani kofta and were really disappointed with the taste. Dal makhni was a bit better and saviour of the day. Unless they improve upon the service and are able to work upon the taste, I will not recommend this restaurant."
4.0,Very nice place for kids and specially nliked mushroom and corn starter. Don't forgot to try hard bhara kabab and mango lassi. Nice and open place.
4.0,Ambience:was its USP; seating area: Charpai etc  Food: nice and tasty  Service:takes a little time but good service  Area: good open area   Theatre:nice classical movies   Tip: come on Thursday when movie is played. (Like Sholay) Overall: good experience.. worth a try
5.0,Omg! Can't praise this place enough. Their mutton roganjosh and lassi is to die for. The ambience is like a modern dhaba. The staff is extremely polite and friendly.
3.0,"Ambience will impart u a feeling like a sofisticated dhaba. Some items are good like cheesy rumali cigars, tandoori chicken, tanddori roti, etc. But they seem to add colours to the food which which they should avoid. Paneer labbadar was good in taste but disgustingly colourful. Dal makhani was a disaster. Taste was not that of dal makhani, no flavour of butter and look was bloody red. I request the hotel management to stop adding colours in all items. Natural look of food is healthier for all."
4.0,"The first time I went my experience was very bad with the time taken for the order to be taken and time taken for the food to come to table. I visited a second time with friends this time, and that too on a sunday during rush hours of the day. Contrary to my past experience they have strived to improve and also serve good food. The only problem is avoid lunches at this place during summer. You will enjoy the ambiance much during night with open air and a desi punjabi vive and food"
4.0,"Nice place. Cool Ambience. Should try their Achari Panner, their mocktails are must try specially the desi stuff. Would love to visit again."
1.0,"they have a huge menu but zero availability, they show you the ambiance but no food presentation. highly disappointed. its just like fantasy names but poor food."
1.0,"Horrible place ! We went on the weekend, first we had to wait for almost an hour.. and then we had ordered chicken which was not cooked properly and tasted really bad ! Waste of money ! We left even before finishing our meal"
1.0,"#wasteOfTime #belowAverageFood #dontGo #NeverRecommend #lackOfStaff . I wasted my weekend dinner, and lot of time. Will not suggest anyone to go there."
1.0,"Don't let yourself getting fooled by the 4 star rating. Go there, only if you have ample amount of time to waste. We had a booking for 7 people, at 9 pm and we received SMS confirmation for the same. Tables were alloted at 9:30 pm, the reason was delay was told that the staff wrongly noted the booking is for 2 people. Coming on to menu, items are included in the menu which are not available. The service is pathetically slow. The main-course order took more than 45 minutes. Finally when order was served, there were no plates on the table. And it took another few minutes to get the plates.  And in all this hussle, the food was cold when we started eating. Butter roti was ordered and normal roti was served. Just a pinch of garlic in garlic naan. And the chapatis were half baked. Asked for straws for mocktails, which were provided after the fifth intimation.  In short the food was not at all worth for the two and half hours we wasted here.  And and on the top of all this, the place is full of mosquitoes.  So surely, for me the restaurant is added to the No Go list. And I won't recommend it to anyone."
1.0,Most pathetic service due to lack of staff. You can visit if you have alot of time to waste. Food is below average for vegetarian foods. Each meal took around 30mins to arrive.  Won't recommend ever to anyone.
3.0,"Went here for lunch. The place is pretty well done - there's an open-air dhaba kind of feel to it. Food is ok, nothing special. There were some disappointments. Buttermilk was not cold, the biryani a little bland and the appetizers not so cool. But the mutton roghan josh was quite good.  P.S. one of the nicest places to sit here are on the right of the entrance. They're low seats that are very comfortable."
3.0,"For enriched taste, the restaurant is simply adding oil , which is not an healthy options.. people will think twice to go for next time.. this restaurant will be kept as an alternative options otherwise..."
3.0,I had been wanting to go her for it's ambience and Thursday movie night. Although Couldn't make it to the movie night. The place has an amazing ambience and gives dhaba feels. We had starters and main course. The main course arrived before the starters. The starter was their chef's special Malai kabab.. it was quite a disappointment. Low on flavor only the presentation was good. The butter chicken and rotis that we had for main course saved the day.
4.0,Nice place to hangout with friends and family. Completely North Indian cuisine and it taste good. The butter chicken with pudina parantha was delicious. It reminded me of Delhi. I like the seating arrangement and ambience. We went on Thursday to catch a movie night.
4.0,"I love this place, I have been there many time and the food is always tasty. Ambience of this place will give you the feel of Dhaba. In morning they will serve the unlimited chai in 40rs. In this current visit we have ordered Paneer achari, dahi kabab, panir sizzler, oven wings and lassi. All are amazing in taste."
4.0,"In veg especially paneer lababdar is good.  They have bit problem with service but thats mangeable. Ambience here is better than most of the restaurants in HSR, will give 4 points. They need to do some improvements in moctails."
4.0,"The moment you enter you will get the Dhaba kind feeling. As per me best Punjabi restaurant in HSR.  We have ordered naan, laal maas, veg Biryani, chicken tikka, veg galuti kabab and juices. Everything was well balanced.  Earlier I have ordered home delivery also from this place and it was a good experience."
1.0,This review is for biryani. (Veg and egg).They have worst biryani.. infact that is not even biryani. Total waste of money. Behroz Biryani is much much better than this. Avoid eating biryani here.
3.0,"A Vegetarian Review The vibe of the place is very earthy, Punjabi kind. You will notice khaats, and brick walled cosy seating for two, pebbled floor...  Food was so-so Vegetarian Platter - had 4 starters, the cigar was decent, but the rest (panneer, tiki, dahi kebab) were a let down Spinach soup - was plain with hint of garlic, kinda nice Tomato soup - flavorsome Dal Makhani - glorious Malai Kofta - sweet and great Achari mix veg - they did try to do something quirky which did not quite hit the mark Orange lemonade - outstanding drink  Service was lacking in all departments Modest costing and Zomato Gold always helps!"
4.0,"Headed to Silbatti for a team lunch after recently shifting our office to HSR. The place is very mundane, probably much hotter during summers because of the whole set up. We ordered like a hell lot of things from prawn, lamb, chicken to paneer. Everything was on our plates. The regular water was served in mud containers which kept the water slightly cold. All the food items were cooked well. Taste wise and portion wise it was sufficient for 13 of us. The service was also quick. Overall a good food place at pocket friendly budget.  Food: 4.4/5 Service: 4/5 Ambience: 3.8/5 Value for money: 4.5/5"
4.0,Place is very authentic and Desi feels and it was happy tummy night and try paneer lambard (not sure the name ) this is something different. Of those panner ka stuff and good place to just grab a dinner
2.0,Highly overrated place...very average food...not true experience of north indian cuisine...the tastes are lacking...whether it is dal makhani or paneer dish
4.0,It is a really good place to have dinner with your friends and family. They even arrange a bonfire on request. Overall a really good place. They have limited variety in food but the taste is good. The staff is friendly and kind.
4.0,You would want to go at night to enjoy dining and music. What's wrong with noon. Well Bangalore is hotter now and you might not Like the whole smoky affair if you are seated near the kitchen area like us. But we had better experiences in the past so it's a 4 . We have repeatedly ordered dahi ke kabab and paneer starters which are good . They have good chicken starters too like the chicken tikka and Kali mirch tikka. Go ahead and order main course cause almost everything is tasty except the murgh rara which wasnt up to the mark. They do have the best dal tadka too.
3.0,"It looks cool place but food quality, hygiene and service levels are avg. We went to try this looking at 4 * rating but this is far below this rating. It is definitely mis leading rating. For us, it was not repeat!"
4.0,"Good place to have dinner . Gives a native ambience of the East India. Food is good. But to be honest , lot of scope to improve in food taste and quality."
4.0,Want some amazing mouth watering north indian food? This place has just that. But a little overprice. What you must try is their murgh mirch pudina tikka which was absolutely delectable. I also quite enjoyed the ambiance.
3.0,"Small place with nice rustic dhaba touch, can get tricky during rainy seasons else it works. Been there number of times since near to my house and on the budget part not too heavy on pocket. Thought sometime you have to wait 30-40 min during weekends. Food is ok but service is very slow. Have almost tried very veg starter dish - Roomali Cigar is something u cant miss. Main course is good too, but not much varieties but works. Desserts and Drinks I feel are lil over priced.  Can improve service and add-ons like sirka onions, pickle without asking multiple times."
4.0,A nice retro style restaurant which serves absolutely delicious food at modest pricing.  Been here couple of times. Their roties and chicken are great. Good place to hangout with friends and family in HSR layout.  The only con would be their slow service.
4.0,"A decent place to have team lunches. Not a great ambience or decor but the concept is cool. They have umbrellas hanging, village like vibe going. But the food makes up for everything. Finding a restaurant serving this good North Indian flavoured food is tough. All the non-veg items are good. you won't go wrong ordering any of them."
4.0,"Extremely good place for the taste of authentic North Indian Food! I tried Dal Makhani & Paneer Lababdar.. both were finger licking good. Quantity was also good, sufficient for 2 people in single serving. Ambience is typically apt as the name suggests.  Must try for quality food.. happy with the experience."
1.0,"These people are not professionals..do not know how to serve customers..absolutely clueless..we went in the evening at 8:45 there was a waiting time of around 20 mins ..and then got a table to serve for three of us a starter , shorba which were sort of ok ..planner tikka masala absolutely worst and Baingan bartha was sort of ok ..but there was endless wait to get this on our table ..nightmare experience people ..we were out of the restaurant at around only 11:15 pm ..bunch of unprofessional people run this restaurant..go here if u have all the time in d world and ready to wait for a lifetime to get the food ordered at ur table..avaoidable restaurant"
3.0,Been here many times. Good place to relax and have food. Always liked there dal tadka with ghee rice. Service was slow. They arrange movie screening on every Thursday but sound system was real bad
3.0,"Nice ambiance and staff however felt that sofas could have been more clean and tidy.  Coming to food, he was nothing extraordinary to be mentioned. I would say there was nothing very specific which I would like to mention. Food was ok and was not as hot it should be on table."
4.0,"The ambience is very good. However, their service is a tad bit slow. The biryani was killer and the Amritsari macchi was very good too. The best thing is that their green chutney is finger licking good! For a family meal together, it's actually a cosy little place in HSR, worthy of your time."
3.0,"The ambience is nice and unique. Though food was okay ain't that great. Though one can try it once. Also, got a complimentary drink as they couldn't give us a place of our desire as it was reserved."
1.0,"Overrated and underwhelming !  Was recommend by my friend to dine here but I was in for a rude shock when each and every dish tasted so bad. It started with Tomato Dhaniya shorba - very thin and inconsistent, unnecessary spices added to the soup, tasted awful. Dahi ke kabab- Ive had dahi ke kabab in roots restaurant, koramangala. That was stuffed with nuts and fried with ghee. Expected much better from here as this is an INDIAN ONLY restaurant but sadly, the dahi kababs lacked any flavor and it was very bland. Paneer Lababdar - The waiter recommended this saying its their best vegetarian dish. I have had this in couple of other places too before but this one again lacked any good flavor, It was just a red gravy with cubes of Paneer in it. Very underwhelming taste. Then comes the  garlic naan which also was disappointing because of the thickness and inconsistency of butter and garlic on it. Was very thick and wasnt buttered evenly, very less garlic too. P.S. : giving 1 star because the price paid for the food was pretty high compared to the taste of the items served."
2.0,No idea why we waited 40 mins for this place. Food was way too bad.ordered karhai paneer n malai kofta in veg.both were way too bad.malai kofta (yellow in color:/)was so bad that no one touched it.butter chicken was just okay.no wonder how this place has such a nice rating. The 2 stars i gave were for lassi(d only thing good here). Dissapointed with the place.
4.0,Pros:  Various sitting arrangements for big and small groups.  Tasty food Affordable  Great ambiance   Cons: Slow service Usually crowded  Not recommended if you are hygiene freak. Preference to Delivery guys instead of in-house customer
4.0,"Been here once based on reviews from Zomato. Found this place happening, i would definitely suggest this place for small family dinner. One thing which disappointed me is the quantity given in platter was considerably less, they should be working on it. Tastd was good, i had ordered mutton khorma [excellent] chicken vindaloo [average] chicken platter [test was too good but again quantity issue]"
2.0,"I have been here couple of times with friends and family.   Ambiance: The place a semi open/open seating area. There are chairs and some on the ground seating. So you can choose where you are seating. I even saw couple of khat being laid out (for the punjabi dhaba feel). The overall feel is of a crowded dhaba with kitchy decor.Service: A clueless and hurried service. Customer service does not seem like a priority here.  Food: You get what you pay for, hence cannot complain too much. Prices are modest and so is the taste of the food. The mocktails are just sweet syrups and entirely avoidable. The gravies are okay. Rotis can be better if served hot. However we received cold rotis .... we didnt bother ordering more as food did not really makes up happy. I would say, go if you need to step out on a shoe string budget. But not a place   to visit for any occasion."
4.0,Visited this place and found worth it... We ordered  1. Dahi ke kebab -- very good 2. Pesto paneer -- not good 3. Subz dum biryani -- great taste 4. Paneer lababdar -- very good 5. Paneer nanniza -- just ok not as expected 6. Dal -- very good  Overall a good experience from food wise.. Sitting was a different but not great...
2.0,Ambience is good but food is pathetic. Order 5-6 items in both veg and non-veg but taste was missing in every item. I would recommend to go to other places which are nearby and are having good reviews.
1.0,"Food are really tasteless, even the buttermilk was so salty. Horrible experience. Will never recommend this to anyone. Only interior is good."
5.0,"This is a very different place in Bangalore, we love to go there again n again. Ambiance is much different company to other places. U feel much readable."
4.0,A good north indian restaurant. Nice dhabha style ambience. Food was good. Ordered laal maas. Was good but not great. Paneer lababdar was very nice. Overall a nice place to have sunday dinner.
5.0,The food is delicious and the service is great! Don't forget to add Dal Tadka to your North Indian order. It's delicious. One of the checklist completed with Silbatti!
1.0,"Very late serving. It took them almost an hour to just serve the starters. Also, found an insect in the chicken curry. It was inside the chicken. Don't know how they managed that. Awful experience. They did not even apologize for that. Very bad."
2.0,"Well, i had better food at many other places. The manager was arrogant in his own wright when i inquired about a dish preparation and method used, as it wasn't authentic.  And finally, the rating that this place has would baffle many.  Not a place worth going again indeed."
4.0,"Lovely ambience, yummy desi food!! Staff needs to improve in attending the customers.. but overall a very beautiful experience.. Thanks for a good lunch!!"
4.0,"Fantastic experience...nice cool ambience, good food, fresh ingredients and authentic north indian taste. Light on palate and pocket as well. Value for money. They just need to get their servers more interested in what they are doing....motivate them and you would rock."
3.0,Great place in HSR to enjoy North Indian food. The ambience is dhabba style. Do try their masala fries chicken! The main course (Murgh Taka Tak) did not live up to my expectations considering the starter was really good.
5.0,"Cozy seating, delicious food and great service! If you're looking for a place with all these amenities then Silbatti should be your best friend.  As the restaurant's ceiling was hollow at the center the experience was amazing as it was raining at that point of time.  We absolutely loved their paneer and chicken starters. I would also recommend you to try out their cheese garlic naan. We haven't tried much of their main course except for the kadai paneer and it was delicious.  Would definitely love to visit again."
1.0,"Pathetic service. You have to ask again and again for your order. Also, the starters came on table without the plates being arranged. Worst thing is that they don't give you plates/cutlery even asking for number of times. After starters you have to wait for almost an hour to get main course items."
4.0,"Nice ambience and gives one the feel of Punjab. Golgappa Pani : good drink Anardana ras : the blend of pomogranate and lemon is good and the chat masala takes the drink to a next level Sahi palak shorba: rich in spinach and the tiny garlic Crips add to the flavour Basant ke phool : nice . The marinate used to coat the broccoli and cauliflower is good. We were interested in trying out the artisan indian breads and ordered 4 different ones for the three of us assuming each kind comes with just one or two pieces of bread like how a roti or naan is served. In reality, it comes with 4 slices each!! Also due to some confusion , we got some paneer gravy instead of dum aloo which we had ordered. Now coming back to the dishes. Artisan flat breads: 1. Fruit and nut: a plain naan is coated with jam and topped up with tuity fruity, cashew , dried grapes, and chuncks of some fruits. 4 slices are served. You can have it like a dessert too! 2. Basil butter: plain naan coat with fresh basil paste with butter. Liked this among the four we ordered. 3. Olive oil naan : plain naan is coated with olive oil 4. Sun dried tomatoes: this is served like a pizza and is loaded with cheese slices in between and the sun-dried tomatoes are topped up. Panner gravy: the gravy tasted very good. A sandwich is made out of two panner slices with tuity fruity in between and the same is coated with batter and deep fried."
4.0,"Must visit place with the family if your staying in HSR area for it's ambience - Desi style... Food was really good, service and staff were also too good .. love to visit again for sure Food - 4/5 Ambience -4.5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Overall - 4/5"
1.0,"We ordered soups and starters. Dahi k pakode, chicken tikka, corn seekh. Starters were good. For main course , we ordered Veg kolhapuri, Paneer lababdar, phulkas, butter naan, veg pulao. all the items were pathetic. Veggies incompletely cooked even the spices uncooked. Veg kolhapuri had just beans and chilli (not even salt). Paneer labadar was no less than a dessert. No authentic taste. For the price tag, expectations are much high. 5 ppl were not able to finish any of the main course items apart from starters"
1.0,"Poor food quality. Poor servicing, we had to ask for the veg starters a hundred times. Had stomach upset after having veg food here. Not at all recommended"
3.0,"Ordered Biriyani, it was little spicy and the rate is also little high, but can try with Zomato gold membership, when you buy one will get one for free... But the best thing I have noticed is they served a pink coloured onion with green chatni. I don't know how they made that colour but trust me it taste really really good. I think it's some kind of vinagiri they used to get that colour and taste. . The ambience was also really nice. And sorry as we were soo hungry i was not in a patience to click the pic of biryani. And yes they take a lot of time to serve food also..."
3.0,Got to know they serve Good biryani's...So i visited....but well...nothing that great....The biryani is normal n not to wat i expected....The only difference is Their ambience is like dabha style....And even seating is diff....dts all...1 time visit....
3.0,"Nice food quality and ambiance. #desistyle ambiance with #cots and #lowlight, can go with family and friends. Only thing missing is #hotcofee"
2.0,It was our first visit to this place. Ambience is quite good like a dhaba. For starters we ordered 'ghee roast chicken' it didn't not taste good. It's far from the actual mangalorean ghee roast chicken. For main course we ordered butter naan and kadhai chicken. The naan was cold when it was served and chicken was not cooked properly.
4.0,Very good place for North Indian food. The ambience is open air and service is good. All panner dishes are good and service is quick. Must try out once if you live in and around HSR.
3.0,"Had dinner from here... ordered garlic naan, tandoori thepla, baingan bartha, chicken chaamp, lassi and lime juice. I would say that the food is just average. Lassi was mixed with vanilla ice cream which was not my taste.. Baigan bartha did not have the smokey taste... overall just an average experience, not worth the money we spent..."
4.0,"A simple and delicious food, with to themed interior. whenever I visit Bangalore , this restaurant makes me feel like I am at home. Service and food both are good."
4.0,"It's a nice place, been there twice and enjoyed my time there. It opens up at 7 in the morning, thus a real good breakfast option for northerners. Had chole bhature and poha, it tasted good though can be better. Food-3.5 Service-4 Ambience-4. 5 Cleanliness-4"
1.0,"Based on our 1st visit we visited this place.But it was totally waste of money and time.When we visited 1st time we ordered biriyani and some starters and it was quite good at taste.But this time full disheartened with the menu we have ordered.The starter ghee roast chicken was so pathetic and useless and seemed gravy item.Kadhai chicken was not well cooked and chicken was not fresh.We also ordered their so called mocktail pitcher orange lemonade which was atleast worthy for 4 people.Seeing the ratings we visited and disappointed.If they serve same quality of food,their market will go down."
5.0,"One of the best restaurants in HSR. The rotis are soft, and sabzis are delicious! Must try the Poha for breakfast/snacks! Also, really good ambience!"
1.0,As recommended the bestseller we ordered lal maas but it was pathetic just mutton served in tomato chuttney is all I can say...it's a shame if they say they r one of the best north Indian cuisine...not at all recommended for food although the ambiance was gud
3.0,"For a weekend lunch, we opted for some authentic north indian delicacy. Won't say it is the best I have tried. But the spread was decent. Service was not so great, we were delivered the wrong food item, but they immediately changed it. Thanks for that. The drinks could be better."
3.0,"Place is good, service is decent, waiters/waitresses are really good, but food could be better. Their medium spicy is in fact not at all spicy"
3.0,"Food: Good Ambience: Good Service: staff are courteous but very slow We have chosen silbatti special chicken soup, chicken vandola and tava roti. Soup: for me it was not good, i will not prefer it. Chicken Vandola: it liked it. Little spicy but good."
5.0,I was here for lunch on a weekend. Food was awesome and quantity was huge. I will recommend to try indian startes here. Few staffs were odia and they were really good and polite...
3.0,"Staff is very polite ..and service was very fast and they have some rule like you will get your order in 30 min or you will get your order free... taste was not bad(sabji is little bit sour).pesto paneer,dal makhani and lassi was good.."
4.0,A lovely place to spend time with friends or family. The ambience is good so is food.  The starters were great. Most starters have a good portion. But few the portions were less. The taste is great.  Rotis and curries were good. The roti were soft and crusty. And the tandoor is made fine. I loved their rotis than naan.  The cleanliness could be improved. Otherwise a great place to dine!
4.0,"Good place to hangout with friends also different varieties of foods.we enjoy a lot. Also on price basic also it's good for more, so go & try once."
3.0,"Pleasantly surprising ambience with generous portions when it comes to food. Could be cleaner, but I am nitpicking really here. A solid choice for budget group outings."
4.0,"Quite impressed with ambiance. We tried veg starter , sizzling paneer curry & roti. Sizzling paneer curry taste could be better than that. Overall had a great time there."
3.0,"Silbati- the name attracted me to go and try the food here. I really liked the seating arrangements like the Dhabas in North India and little raw look. The Ambiance is good, and non-noisy even though it's on the main road. The food was good not excellent. We tried a few curries and mutton biryani. The biryani wasn't cooked well but they cooked it again when we asked. 4/5 for ambiance 3/5 for food."
4.0,Good place with simple decor. Tandoori chicken is a must try ! Masala kulcha tastes great .. But the Indian gravies are not so great.. Service is very slow.. !!! Worth a try for sure .
4.0,"Pretty place, looks beautiful in the evening with all the lighting. The food is great preparation wise and the quantity will not disappoint you. Great place to spend an evening with family! P.S they also have live match screenings"
4.0,"It was just nice. Thats an apt description. Nothing was too awesome or too bad. Its just nice. If thats what you look for , this is the place."
4.0,"Liked the north indian food served..   Heads up.. the quantity of the main course is for two..   Also liked the rustic, dhaba inspired seating.  Service was also good."
4.0,Ambience - good Hygiene- good Service - good  Food - good  Menu has an interesting twist on traditional punjabi cuisine. Some places which take you on such twists and turns will have you tasting something familiar but not quite so good. Silbatti does it well.
4.0,A Dhaba style restaurant with great ambiance added to great food and service. Highly recommended and a must try for anyone in or near HSR Layout.
4.0,"Went for dinner with family on 23/12. Our first time here post hearing good feedback. Great food indeed. VFM - 4.5/5 Food - 5/5 Ambiance - 3.5/5 Staff - 4/5 Overall a good experience. Gets crowded and reservation is advisable. Our order: Till Dill Murgh, Awadhi Gosht Biryani, Murgh Rara, Roti"
5.0,Very nice place with North Indian cuisines. The ambience is like a Dhaba. Food is very reasonable and tasty. I often visit this place for lunch.
2.0,"Visited this restaurant recently in group of 4.Ordererd soups starters , maincourse and lemonade drinks. Veg soup 1* Non veg soup3* Pepper chicken 2* Tawa fish fry 3* Dahi kebab 3* Maincourse was not good. Breads were not properly cooked chicken dishes were also very bad. Murg taka tak 1* ( spoiler) Murg hara pyaz 1*(large chicken pieces, not cooked properly)  Mint lemonade 4* Cranberry lemonade 2*  Overall experience was below average."
4.0,Decent place with decent ambience and food quality. To be precised I would give 3.5 rating if I had an option. Good place to satisfy your stomach if you are hungry and hanging out in nearby location of HSR.
3.0,The drinking glasses were untidy. And the coke was really bad. Non veg food was good and vegetarian food was just fine. Staff was good and attentive.
3.5,"Located in Sector 4 in HSR, Silbatti is a dhaba style restaurant serving delicious North Indian food at reasonable prices. I was here with my buddies to celebrate my birthday and needless to say, we had an amazing time.  They have low rise seating and you get options for rope cots as well. Coming to the food, they serve mostly North Indian cuisine. There is strictly no alcohol available. Chicken Ghee Roast - A decent starter item but the taste didn't match the regular ghee roast we get in a Mangalorean restaurant. Tawa fish fry - Fish Fillet marinated with lemon and fried with chilli and curry leaves. This is a must have for fish lovers. Tandoori Jhinga - Chilli and lemon marinated prawns cooked in tandoor was crispy and yum, but nothing special. It seemed like regular prawns fry.  Pepper Chicken - Seriously, one of their best preparation. I loved the gravy and the chicken was so succulent and delicious.  Cheesy Roomali cigar - Shredded mushroom and cheese stuffed in roomali sheets were truly delectable and crisp.  Butter Tandoori Roti and Lal Maas - This combination was a hit. Rotis were soft and the mutton was perfectly cooked with right amount of spices.  From drinks, I would recommend the Masala Shikanji and Anardana Ras. The mocktails here are extra sweet and ruins the taste.   Service was good considering the huge crowd and the staff is well behaved. A decent option for those looking for desi cuisine at a reasonable price."
3.0,"Decent food at least close to being real North Indian weird staff, do not understand basic stuff written on the menu. Okayish ambience but a good escape from the normal noisy places"
5.0,"Had an amazing time at Silbatti. The food, the ambience, the service has been great, especially Chandan had been warm and saw that everything went perfect.  Kasundi Fish Tikka is a must try.."
3.0,Had a mixed experience here. Ordered mutton biryani and chicken wings. Loved the biryani but hated the chicken wings. Ambience was fine. I suggest you to visit this restaurant on Thursday as they play some Bollywood classics.
3.0,"This place is very well located, nice ambience, dhaba style restaurant. Staff is nice and frequently changing! I have been visiting this place regularly..I have tried almost all the bestsellers they have. All of their dishes tastes good!! Cheers to their Chef!!  The only shortcoming Is that due to open seating area it is really difficult to manage during rains! But still it has been our most go to place!"
5.0,"Went there on Saturday, got a place to sit but was getting crowded. we ordered pesto paneer and veg kolhapuri and both the items of menu were just amazing!. courteous staff! really good food!"
3.0,"First of all it's very crowded... We had to wait 30-40 mins to get a place... We had ordered various items from menu, I would say food was okay... Not that Great !! Not worth to wait for 40 mins for table and another 20 mins for food. They have good ambience but no power backup, power cut happened while we were having food and we had to continue eating in the dark... I have shared few pics when we were having in total dark."
4.0,"An awesome restaurant with beautiful dhaba ambience. The food is superb aswell. Only one hickkup we faced was we booked the table over the phone yet had to wait for around 25-30 mins. We went for lunch on a Friday and ordered cheesy roomali cigar which are delicious and a must try. Tandoori chicken , kasundi machhi tikka, tikka onion capsicum paneer lababdar, murg rara, laal maans, murgh dum biryani and some drinks , the food was superb and the ambience and the aura of the place is serene , must visit place"
2.0,"Setting is good. We went there for dinner and restaurant was screening popular Bollywood movie.  We ordered starter, roti and chicken curry. Roti was the only good thing served there .. rest were below average...  I believe that restaurant needs to focus on making authentic curries"
1.0,I paid 320 rupees for amritsari prawns curry. All I got was 7 small prawns in the dish  I think they should increase that for all dishes of prawns
4.0,"First thing first, Book a table or be ready to wait for so long which is what we had to :) Had dinner here on Sunday. Ordered Paneer Pasanda, Zafrani Malai Kofta with butter roties. Taste wise food was delicious and with Zomato gold, felt economic too. Paneer was soft, gravy was thick and couldn't feel anything in a excess. Both the Gravies have very balanced creamy feel which I really loved. Ambiance was nice too. Tiny colorful lights around, and some kinda traditional feel was given to the place.  Overall a good experience, except slow service."
3.0,"Good place for a casual outing for a dinner. Being roadside in hsr layout, I think its a go to place for people staying around that place , hence , was crowded on a Sunday evening. Wait time was double than what was mentioned at the start . Ambience is nice but tiny lights all over place with mix of various style of seating arrangement including dhaba style seating. Coming to food , we ordered paneer lababdar ( one of the famous cuisine here ) along with garlic naan , I would say it was not upto expectations set being one of the best dish of here. Service was also slow. Price-wise okey .  Ratings can be categorised as : Food - 3/5 Ambience -4/5 Service - 2/5  Overall - 3/5"
3.0,Quality of the food is decent. Service is not good/great. There were few leftovers which we asked them to parcel but they denied cuz we were using Zomato gold. They prefer those items to be in garbage rather than giving it to some needy people.
4.0,"We went there for a Friday lunch and to much of our liking it had that nice North Indian dhaba feel. Both veg and non-veg food was really very good. We also ordered different soft drinks, lassi and almost all were good. We felt minor improvements can be done on quality and speed of service but all in all a good and worth visiting place."
3.0,"The food taste was good no doubt. All the veg items was properly cooked and surprisingly good in taste,even orange lemonade was good n something new to give. But service was pathetic . I need to ask for chutneys more than 5 time but no was listening and they started coming again and again for taking order. The staff was in so hurry that they started cleaning up the place before we finish our food they took the items which even we were eating. If staff behaves like this how much your food is great it will ruin the experience."
4.0,"Really nice place to have good North Indian food. They have this beautiful sitting arrangement and the whole ambience is soothing.  Must try - lassi, Malai kofta  Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 4/5"
5.0,"Wonderful service with very polite and helpful staff. The recommendations from the server were bang on the spot, what we desired. In addition to us, our kid also appreciated the food. Special mention - Tandoori items, and Biryani."
4.0,Have been my goto place anytime if I want delicious North Indian food nearby. Wonderful soups and nicely cooked sabzis will soothe your hungry tummy like anything. They even host a open movie night on Thursday. Overall a very much recommended place for north indian food !!
4.0,A nice airy place in HSR. Authentic North Indian food. Low seating. Great drinks menu (non alcoholic). Rich and very heavy food. Lots of ghee.. butter .. thick gravies and butter soaked naans. Yumm. Don't miss out the chicken biryani.. aromatic mughlai taste. They play movies in the evenings and during the day fun old Bollywood music. Not too heavy on the pocket. This place checks all the boxes
4.0,"Had come here for an office lunch. The food was really nice, especially the jaljeera drink was insanely good. The chicken was really soft and succulent. Good quality meat overall. Definitely will visit again."
3.0,If you want to try some authentic north indian food. You might want to give this place a try . Ambience wise this place has a setup of a mix of traditional and dhaba style. Music played here normally is Bollywood songs. I would rate this place as  Food : 3.8 Ambience : 3.5 Service : 3.5  Overall : 3.5  Happy Fooding!
4.0,The ambience is good but needs to change some of the rope bed. Food is good. We have ordered chicken tikka and Silbatti special chicken. Price is good as per portion of the food.
3.0,"The ambience is desi style but the service is too slow. Looking at the waiting queue and the crowd ,the food didnt satisfy my taste buds. Starting with the starters: Bharvan Kumbh was delicious.. Tandoori Chicken didnt have that juicy and tenderness. Moving towards main course : Paneer Lavabdar was completely dominated by garlic flavour. and the Chicken gravy quantity of chicken was quite less."
2.0,"Good Ambience with light music but when it comes to food ,it's not worth here. Non-veg dishes are bad in taste Butter phulkas are half cooked."
2.0,"Food is quite expensive and quality of food is not as per price.  I ordered pesto paneer that had a peculiar bad taste.  Being hopeful, i tried the main course and ordered kumbh mutter, roti and biriyani. Again, kumbh matar lacked salt and biriyani stayed bland and not living upto its name.   Lassi is a surprise. You should try it. :)"
4.0,"hungry and looking for notrh Indian food,, this is the place to go in HSR layout, small place not great ambience to look at, in weekends it's better to book and visit. Coming to taste no comments , even price is also avg. Serving and clearness should be improved to a next level."
4.0,"Silbatti will give you a feel of desi dhabha in a unique style. You will find some khatiyas to sit and relax. Must say Food is really good in taste.. talking about the veg food, dont know about the non veg. Book your table in advance on weekends because sometimes there will be huge queue to get your number in. Friendly staff and a lively environment.  Regards, Sahil"
3.0,Located in hsr nice ambience nice look good food  but roti was not well cooked rest all is fine Knw come to service service is not at all good want to raise 10 times to call the server guys you must improve on service if you guys improved in service you people can defnintly rock
4.0,"I must say it's a 4.5 for me for this place. Everything that we had did not disappoint us. It's a simple place with an authentic ambiance of a Village with ""charpayees"" and water served in earthen bottles. A must try if you are around this area. The cusine varies from different parts India but they are exclusive with the North Indian cuisine. Will not hesitate to go back here"
5.0,"The food was very good, the portions for the curries were of good size. Nice ambience, very pleasant to sit in the evenings. Good place if you are looking to have some North Indian food."
4.0,"Before I jump into the good part let me just add some notes about the things that seemed a bit problematic to me.  1. I understand the furnitures were picked with good intention and the floor was covered with gravels to make sure the chairs don't move. But this smart choice was also a matter of annoyance because the gravels served their purpose quite well, they even stopped me from moving the chairs to get out and to drag the chair closer to the table.  2. The dinning tables were nice and good, but for my group of 5 five friends ordering a lot of different food choices, the table was far crowded for even to put our plates infront and start.  Now, with the good part. The food was delicious. We all liked everything we had ordered. The stuff were polite but very distracted, maybe because of the sunday afternoon rush. But overall experience was satisfactory. We look forward to visit again, this time maybe not the ""Table on Gravel""."
3.0,"Visited this place on a Saturday afternoon. Good took ages to arrive on table. It was crowded. Drinks like masala shikanji, fresh lime soda were good. Starters had a lot of oil. Veg biryaani was okay. Chicken masala was bland, the gravy tasted like some vegetable gravy. Paneer gravy item was good though. Not a very great experience I would say"
4.0,Went her for lunch and it was a good experience. Its a small cute place with a mesmerising ambience. I bet the place will be magical at night. Night visit is on my list now!! The food was good... everything we ordered was close to perfect and the price is also reasonable. I minus one point for the taste of the biryani which was not up to expectations. But definitely would recommend the place for the unique ambience.
3.0,"Food was average., it can be a economic choice., I will prefer to visit this place in a sunny day rather than a rainy day., as during rains it becomes difficult to sit there.,"
3.0,"The atmosphere inside the restaurant is better than what one thinks before entering, but the seating on the sides are a bit uncomfortable if you are sitting for long. The food what we ordered was not to my expectations, we ordered chicken tandoori for starters, silabatti special chicken and adraki dhaniya chicken for mains of which none were having that good taste also gosht biryani was good here. On recommendation i tried masala kulcha which was fabulous but butter naan which i was served was not properly cooked. You should surely go with the beverages here and sweet lassi is a must have."
3.0,"The food is very average. I ordered some potato starter, Dal Makhani, Paneer Lababdar, naan, Kulchas, Lassi and Orange Mojito. They have a good collection of breads but Dal Makhaniand Paneer Lababdar very very bland. The drinks were really food. The starter dish was burnt to an extent that it tasted bitter. The best thing about the place is the ambience."
4.0,Pleasant experience. Food quality is good. Nice ambience and very friendly staff. Sometimes you have to wait much because of rush so many people here is very frustrated about it but I think it's worth it in this restaurant's case. Must try this restaurant if you are in Bengaluru.  Food - 5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Staff - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Environment - 3/5
1.0,"Bad food! Wouldn't recommend. I usually do not give a negative, but this was bad to the next level! And this review is after 2nd instance! We tried the place once when it opened, and things were bad. Thought it may take time to settle, and tried once again, however, nothing's improved!"
3.0,"First things first: 4 for the veg and 3-3.5 for the non veg. Went with a couple of friends for trying out their 'butter chicken' considered as the best butter chicken in Blore (nice, but not quite there!). We ordered the Veg Platter and the Non Veg Platter for starters and was super impressed with their Dahi Kebab and Aloo Tikki. Non-veg was meh as it lacked the punch, the prawns were a bit burnt (tandoor gone wrong). Then came the much awaited butter chicken, which was unfortunately my least favourite dish of the night. It lacked the richness of the butter and wasn't creamy as I thought it would be. But the Vegetable Sabzi was quite the saviour of the night and so were the drinks - Orange Lemonade and Cranberry Lemonade. The place has its own charm (reminded me of the good ol Dhabas) and the staff is courteous but can do much better in terms of service.  Friendly Advice: If long queues and an endless wait time is no-zone then I'd suggest you avoid coming here on a sunday night. And needless to say, the service can be pretty slow on busier days."
3.0,"Delivery here is very bad. We almost waited more than 40 mins for our order to be on table. The food is good. We ordered dal khichdi, Kali mirch chicken, masala buttermilk was superb... Loved it... Murg dum biriyani was also good. It tastes something different from the other Andra biriyani... I will surely try this place once more. Hope I will get my order soon."
1.0,"I only found the lassi to be good. Also a suggestion, never ever put bournvita on lassi, spoils the whole thing. Ordered Butter chicken, turned into salty chicken, they took it back and got it again, but it turned into masala chicken. Thought they would serve authentic North Indian food, but was very disappointed."
3.0,"Mixed reviews. Starters were good but main course was not upto the mark. Service was slow. Pro is that you get to sit on khaat (cot). Got to know that they screen a movie on thursdays so If i visit again, will rate again."
1.0,Very less quantity for 1 plate platter. Should increase the quantity of all the items. Taste wise I would say it was OK. Not a recommendable item.
4.0,"Simple urban decor with lively Bollywood music.The food is good and they have a north Indian mughlai cuisine to choose from. We had ordered : Pesto paneer: 1 of the best starters.Finely cubed paneers baked with veggies and creamy sauce. Chicken tengdi: Finely baked leg pieces with Indian spice blend in a tandoor. Pulao: mildly sweet with abundant dry fruit and pineapple chunks. Mutton gravy: Thick rich gravy base with pieces of mutton. The rotis were fresh. They have a nice range of mocktails and sherbets to choose from.I didn't like the jaljeera that much.  The service is good.Courteous and friendly staff. The plce has a lil netwrk issues. Overall,a nice plce to visit with ur frnds and fam for a good hearty meal... Keep up the good work team.."
1.0,"First thing first. It's a unique place I have visited over 10 times. Brought in at least 20 buddies over a period of time. And i can vouch for its biryani. Worth every penny.  But service is pathetic. Servers have no idea. Absolutely no idea about menu about food about how to behave with guest. This review ahead is about my visit yesterday where I had 6 guests along with me.  We order 4 chicken biryani , an egg biryani and a tandoori chicken. All's well. Tandoori chicken is served first. It was just to filler order as we were using 3 gold on our table. We all jumped at the plate . Hungry after a long day at wonderla. Next moment all 5 of 6 of us (1 veg) spitted out the bite. It was overloaded with salt.  Called server asked him to replace it as it had too much salt. I say too much as it was not slightly more it was too much. I am never finicky with a bit up or down with anything. Server picked up and left making a weird face. 10 mins down we are told dish cannot be replaced as it will again have same level of salt. Strike one.  We had biryani served 5 in all. We shared and finished off in no time and were all full. Now we are asked about the replacement for tandoori chicken. We asked them to get us an extra biryani.  This 6th biryani appears after half an hour when we are all done and ready to leave. We politely ask the server to pack it as all of us were filled. Manager comes in and says it cannot be packed as we are using gold on our table. Strike 2.  I asked if he will be able to serve it again to some other guest. He said obviously no. I asked if he will throw it away . He said yes. He would throw it away rather than pack it away coz we used gold. He asked us to remove a gold and then he would pack biryani. He started explaining gold rules to me. Strike 3  My takeaways and feedbacks -  You did this with a regular customer. I will never be comfortable eating in your restaurant again.  You are inclined to waste food, we Don't. Please don't throw away food in this country where many of us sleep hungry.  We all were full and were going to give it to some poor fellow living off street. He would had a good night's sleep. But thanks to ur pissed because you send a horrible dish back attitude, good food was thrown away.  Owner of this restaurant if you are reading this review. I totally loved this place. Please hire people with passion for food and people. It's a beautiful place but your staff is ruining experience. It will bring bad business and will ruin everything."
1.0,How can one have undercooked chicken in a biryani? Was amazed. On seeing carefully it became clear that they boil chicken in salt water . Mix in rice and spices and serve on the name of biryani. Pathetic. Will never go back again.
1.0,"Pathetic service and pathetic behaviour by the manager and  staff. Food had excess salt. we were 6 frnds and we used three golds. One of our food item came late, after we had food, so we asked the staff to pack it for our dog. The manager denied packaging the food saying he would throw it rather then packing it. He also asked us to remove our one gold and parcel the food in exchange. We were shocked to see such behaviour. Why have these guys taken gold zomato membership if they do not want to give gold services to customers. I dont think i am going to eat there again."
2.0,"Visited on a Friday afternoon when it was raining. Service - 2/5 ( a little slow and not very suggesting and knowledgable about the menu) Ambience - 2/5 (good spaces our seating but too many houseflies and you get a whiff is a drain once in a while) Music - 5/5 good music. Food - 3/5  We ordered Dahi ke kebab, bangalore chicken kebab, kulcha, roomali roti, dal makhani, veg biryani. Food was average. Have eaten better north Indian in HSR itself. The roof was leaking and water was dripping onto our table and food cuz of the rain. But I can excuse that. Has a very Dhaba wala feel. May not visit again."
2.0,Food is good... ambience is also good.only thing they charge service charge and gst together which is illegal and u have to pay this amount ..am ok to pay tips everyone does that but don't do illegal things.
4.0,"Visited Silbatti for Sunday lunch.  We had to wait for a while as this place can be fully occupied during lunch time.  We ordered Seekh kabab, Murg Kadhai, rotis  Seekh kebabs were good, chicken kadhai gravy was amazing, some rotis were bit burnt. Apart from that everything about this place was pleasant.  Our waiter confused another family's order of butter naans with us, which left me puzzled as we had ordered for rotis. They realized this soon and then we joked about it.  The ambience is like a blend of village + Dhaba.  Service is bit on slower side, so plan and organize your orders accordingly."
3.0,Good food but bad service. We ordered a starter and a main dish. We had to wait a lot to get our food. We got our main dish before starters and they asked to have main dish before starters. We said no and they took that away. Again we had to wait for food. But they gave complimentary papad  Food was really awesome
4.0,"A dhaba themed North Indian restaurant, Silbatti has friendly staffs & certain items are pretty good.  Have been there more than once & never been disappointed with food or the service yet. Mr. Javed, in particular, tries to understand the tastes & suggests dishes appropriately. I've liked Mutton Sukka, Til Dil Mugh & Murgh Rara.  Cheers to Mr. Javed & the entire Silbatti team. Tag : Nikhat Firdose"
4.0,"Very nice dhaba style ambience and fast service. We waited 10 minutes to get a table. Quickly we ordered one Dhaniya Tomato Soup which was Okay type. Then we got one Til Dill Chicken which was the best among what we ordered. Very tasty, very smoky. Then we got the main course which are Lamb Rogan Josh (not so wow), Lachha Parota (as usual), one Garlic Naan(soft and nice but too pricy) and one fresh lime soda(so much refreshing). Overall a very nice experience of good service and food. To my surprise we didnt feel so full even after having these many items . Guys, dont think too much, just drop in and enjoy your time here. Must visit place for food lovers."
5.0,"Very good ambience. Liked the food. Quick service. Recommended for friends and family. Had Til chicken starter, Corriender shorba, Laacha Parota, garlic naan and Mutton Rogan Josh. All these items were nice. Mutton Ragon Josh was not as expected, Mutton was average. Finally done with Fresh Nimbo soda. Overall experience was satisfactory."
5.0,Very friendly and hardworking staff. Delicious food. We ordered jain food with no gatlic and onion during navratri's and providi the same with such delicious taste is fab.
2.0,Saw the rating and went..Very bad staff service.had to ask for water multiple times. We were forced to have main course before starter since waiter came 3rd time with main course before starter.even food taste was not as expected. Too much disappointing .
5.0,"By all means, one of the best restaurants around HSR layout..  Paneer starter and veg Biryani I tried. Both are awesome..  One can try without any hesitation here.. the ambience is very good if you visit night time.."
4.0,"A dhaba style restaurant in HSR. There will always be waiting so make a wise choice by booking in advance, unless you mind waiting. We didnt order much, but whatever we ordered was good. Not out-of-the-world food, but one of the good places to satiate the North Indian taste buds."
4.0,"Visited the place with office colleagues.Ordered many food items.I dont try soups when I visit places, but here it was really great.Murgh dhaniya soup and for starters ordered mixed platter and ajwaini fish.good place to hang out."
4.0,"Had been for a team dinner. Everything is so tasty that you wouldn't forget the taste for a very long time. We ordered dahi mushroom, veg roll, malvani chicken curry, fish tawa fry, jhinga fry, mutton gosht biriyani and chicken dum biriyani,and all most all the mocktails . 4 raying because Service is too late and biriyani disappointed a bit"
4.0,"Actual rating - 3.5/5  Decent dhaba kind ambiance, good food but disappointing service.  Visited the joint this Sunday, Now, the setup is more like a dhaba, very spacious and cozy and so is the choice of serving utensils.....very dhaba like. However, I would've preferred a bit more light.  Coming to food, while I'll come to bizarre mismatch of order and serving later, whatever was served was quite nice. Ordered below items:-  1. Zaitooni Paneer Tikka - It was good, although, completely devoid of olives themselves or the flavors. Not that it was bad, it was actually quite good. It's just didn't make any sense. I had a ask twice to the staff before they admitted that olives weren't in stock. Would've preferred if they told us before. 2. Nanizza - Again, ordered one flavor, got served other but not before they took it away and I had to call them and ask to serve. Paneer tikka naanizza was good. A little burnt flavor of naan was making it a charred but in a good way. 3. Sizzling Paneer - Again a tasty dish. Adequate spicy and flavored. 4. Pudeena Paratha - Very nice, very soft and well cooked.  Coming to service, while I do not have any complain on staff behavior as they were quite courteous, they had a huge lack of coordination. Lack of communication between servers and kitchen, servers themselves resulted us getting different and incomplete orders. They seriously need to work on this front.  Overall, I liked the joint and will visit again for non-veg options. Good luck!"
4.0,"A regular to this place, Ive tried many items and liked them. However Ive had an unforgettable experience where in weve orderd pindi-chole and it is wasnt in line with the other items you get here. An item you should probably think twice before ordering. Looks wise and taste wise your in for surprise."
1.0,We went on a special occasion in family. Service was extremely slow. We did not get the main course even after 60 mins and hence we paid for the starters and drinks and left. Will never visit again.
4.0,Pocket friendly and decent place for a family outing. The food was okay. Some of the dishes were really good like the Achari Tawa Sabzi...but the Tandoori chicken was a let down. Lassi was good while the lime soda was bad. They need to be consistent with taste. Service was again not consistent. The head waiter was very friendly and accommodating though.
4.0,"Awesome food with good quantity in reasonable price.  I have requested to prepare food without onion and garlic, chef has done wonderful job. Taste wise it was yummmm. Thanks to serve us good and yumiii food."
4.0,Good place to have desi dinner with dhaba style ambience.  Food and Price: Good food in reasonable price. Orange lemonade is must try in drinks.  Ambiance: Very nice dhaba style ambience. Good interior.  Service: Slow on weekends.  PS: No parking place. One of the best around the area.
5.0,"Awesome North indian dishes. We went for lunch and we had superb experience . Restaurant is very clean. Nos of table are less, so you have to wait for some time on weekends and for dinner specially.Both non-veg and veg starters and main course is superb. Chicken wings are a worth try here..Not a good place for biryani lovers..last but not least ZOMATO GOLD WORKS HERE!!!"
2.0,"Food was quite average. Staff and service was really poor. Ambience was below average. Location is also off and it is not value for money. Overall:2/5, Food: 2/5, Staff: 1/5, Ambience: 2/5"
4.0,Been there with friends loved the food and ambience gud place to spend ur time with family and friends and the staff are very friendly and is gud
5.0,"This was our second visit and I really liked the food and ambiance. The restaurant is quite open and has lot of natural light coming in. We ordered Tandoori Chicken, Tava Fried Fish, Chicken Tikka masala and Malabar prawn. All of us really liked the food. I was here with my 8 month old on a stroller, the staff were very accommodating to give us an appropriate table to fit the stroller.  Will surely visit soon!"
5.0,"Nice Food, have visited twice in a week because I liked the taste a lot. Good and polite staff. Value for money. Surely will visit again. The ambience is also very good."
4.0,"Relatively easy on pocket, good in taste. Conveniently located on 19th main.   Food - 4/5 Drink - 4/5 Ambiance - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Value for money - 5/5 Good point - it also serves breakfast  Negative point - no parking space Cleanliness- 3/5  Must try items - North Indian food is good and cocktails"
4.0,Such a nice place which will give you feel of village. We went for lunch and tried many items. Mocktails are really nice here as well butter milk. Paneer tika was the best item I found in my lunch. But fish tikka was not that soft n testy. Masala kulcha was awesome and mutton keema was also fabulous. Ambience was good but looking but old due to less maintenance. Overall place and food was good.
3.0,"I visited this place with my family on Sunday evening for dinner. Place is on the main road and parking is available on road only. Place was almost full. They have nice desi ambience with seating like khat and furniture of cane. They were playing amazing hindi songs. The staff was courteous and quick. We ordered Bharwan Kumbu and Dahi ke kabab for starters. Bharwan kumbh was really good and dahi ke kabab was average. In main course we ordered paneer tikka masala, butter naan, phulka, dal takda, and ghee rice. All the items in main course were average. They serve alcohol and non veg too but this review is in context of veg items only. Taste - 3/5 Quality - 3.5/5 Quantity - 3.5/5 Price - 4/5 Service - 3.5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Chances that I will return - 70%"
4.0,"Had been to this place for lunch. Ambience is good. They have made it like dhaba. Well organized place with nice sitting arrangements. They play all remix of old songs. Nice hangout place.  Ordered Veg Kebab Platter, Butter Roti, Murg Hara Pyaaz and lime soda. Cheesy cigar Roll and paneer tikka was tasty in platter. Dahi kebab and aloo Badami Tikki was good but kinda dry. It could have been better. Murgh Hara Pyaaz was delicious. Chicken pieces were very soft and gravy was too tasty. Must try!  Staffs were courteous and service was fast. Reasonable price and tasty food.  A must try place!"
4.0,"I went to Silbatti on a Saturday, which also happened to be Karwa Chauth day. I live in Whitefield and my family decided to have dinner at a far off location and at a place we had never been before. We randomly selected this restaurant going by Zomato ratings. And we are happy that we chose Silbatti. We decided to go veg that day and everything that we ordered was lip smacking tasty. Bharwa mushroom is a must-order starter, cheese nan was out of the world. Mango lassi was rich, creamy n yummy too. Other dishes that we ordered and found excellent were tandoori moongfali sabji, kumbh makai palak, paneer lababdar, dahi kebab. I would give a 4.2 rating on veg food. Will definitely try non veg later."
5.0,As it was late in night during dusshera and wanted to have some good biryani.. After a lot of searching and finding we went to this place and we were amazed with the ambiance and the food they served it was lip smacking biryani along with some pudina tikka
2.0,"1.Quantity offerred for 1+1 food was much lesser than that of a normal starter. 2. Ordered Items: Ajwaini fish kabab - did not like the food, food was clearly saying that it was not fresh Clay oven chicken wings: quantity was very less Murgh dum biriyani: taste was good. Overall experience: not good"
4.0,"Zomato gold for food. Must say, more than the food, the ambience is just stunning! Will take you to the 80s and 90s. Music from that generation. Place set as a dhaba. Food is also great. We just tried the mutton biriyani and the prawn tawa. Both were amazing. What stood out was the ambience. Service is okay. Could have been better."
5.0,"If you like mushrooms; then Bharwan Kumbh is a must try. Have been to this place thrice and I always end up ordering this starter.  Tried Murgh Rara, Paneer Lababdar, Dal Makhni till date. Order any of their main course and you wont be disappointed.  Masala Chach & Masala Shikanji is also worth a try.  Food  5/5  Ambience  4/5  Service  3/5  Though it is always crowded on weekdays as well but waiters need to pay some attention to customers. They look lost !"
4.0,I love trying new places and one fine day I visited this place...I usually dont like chicken of mostly places but I tried here and just loved it..Their lassi is just mind blowing..Do try it guys
1.0,I feel the restaurant is overly rated. We went for a corporate gathering and I can say that we didn't feel like reordering any non-vegetarian dish. The only thing we asked for again is some kind of welcome drink. Veg was ok. Paranthas are good. The ambience is good.
1.0,"Bad and slow service Rude staff,no cooperation from manager jawed on billing issues Food quality is worst when crowded Waste of money Waste of time Rude behaviour towards customers"
1.0,Not so friendly staff and food was ok only . Not a good experience. food was okayish. Non cooperative staff. Did not listen to the good complains as well and didnt apply zomato gold too.
1.0,"I just had the worst experience in silbatti with Pranjal and satyam. I went there to have breakfast at 11:00 AM. The first question i asked them was if they were still serving the breakfast because in zomato it was mentioned as closed. They said it's open. I had a zomato gold which i couldn't unlock because it was shown closed according to zomato at that point. One of their staff members asked me to unlock it at 12:00 PM i.e after having the breakfast. So after breakfast when i unlocked the zomato gold, they refused to accept the gold stating they are open only for lunch and not for breakfast. I asked them to adjust the amount in the bill as we were misguided by them in the first place. But the guy seemed to be very rude and didn't want to comply with us on any terms. We did pay the full amount but was very disappointed the way they treated us."
5.0,Totally satisfied with tasty food. It tasted so good just like home made one. We ordered one veg shorba and one non veg shorba tasty and filling enough. The non veg platter had all varieties of items and we fully enjoyed it.
4.0,Was in Bangalore and new to city was exploring Zomato gold restaurants.Silbatti is an awesome place for mughlai lovers. Do try their kebab platter. The sitting here is a bit different and beautiful with a village touch to it. Recommended prior reservation because it's too packed on the weekends. This is why the service is a little slow. Though the staff was very courteous  Food - 5/5 Ambience - 5/5 Service - 4/5
5.0,"What a place!!! Great veg food. We loved every item that we order. Paneer lababdaar, bhindi masal, masala kulcha and rotis.. very friendly staff.. must visit place. Had to wait a bit though. It was worth the waiting."
2.0,The food was below expectation. Welcome drink was okay but starters and main course were not good. Even desserts were not up to mark. Wont recommend.
2.0,Taste was not at all good  May be that was a bad for me at silbatii  Service ok ok  Chicken starter was   Dahi ke kebab : I never had that kind of kebab in my life. Its was not made of hung curd . It was not at all good
2.0,"I wonder how a restaurant like this can get a rating of 4 star! I visited Silbatti with two friends of mine, and had an unpleasant experience.  Most of their appetizers such as Dahi ke Kebabs, Aloo Badami Tikka and Cheesy Rumali Cigar Rolls were missing. So we ordered Basanti ke Phool and Tandoori Moongfalli Starter, both looked identical and there was no difference in both except for the fact that Basanti ke Phool had Broccoli in it, and the Tandoori Moongfalli Starter had just a sprinkling of crushed peanuts on it. Not worth it as we had to return one starter.  Soups - Tomato Dhaniya Shorba and Palak Soup were decent.  The vegetable gilouti kebab was okayish, and the naanizza a big miss.  Again, they did not have the dessert that we wanted to have, which was the Phirni Brulee.  Service was painfully slow."
4.0,"I love the ambience here. Table booking is recommended as there is always a queue at peak hours, as it ia place to with friends or family. Have been here 3 times and never dissapointed. The food quality and quantity is good at resonable rate. A must try restaurant."
2.0,"If you have ample amount of time to wait and have dinner. This is the apt place for you. I went there with my girls.. We ordered chicken kadhai, rice and few chapatis.. This only took them more than 45 mins to serve on table. I had asked the staffs 3-4 times about it.. They just listened and told wait for another 10 mins. It was too frustrating.. We spent 2.5 hours for our dinner. Cons- food is good Pros- servicing is too bad.. Order takes hell lot of time to be served"
2.0,"Theme of restaurant is very nice, food is good not great. However service can be better (maybe it was closing hence they were reluctant maybe ) in terms of hygiene it definitely needs to improve."
3.0,"Our go to place to grab lunch , their dahi kebab and chicken seekh kebab are good  Off late their service time has increased but other wise food is alright"
1.0,"This restaurant should receive ""the shittiest service award"" Not a single waiter follows up with customer after order is placed. If they don't have items precooked it will take forever and meantime if you ask the waiter about the food, they will completely ignore you(that includes calling them over to the table multiple times). Floor manager has no mannes and don't know how to approach a customer who has been sitting for an hour without getting simple items like starters they have ordered. I don't have any complain about the food. But the way management treats customer is absolutely horrible."
5.0,"In hi-tech city of banglore it's hard to find a place with home bliss, but here it is. This place has as aura of village, has different sections for people to sit and enjoy their food. I ordered kadhi, bhindi masala, boondi raita, roti and plane rice. Quantity is more than enough and can serve 3-4 people at once. Had such kadhi rich in flavours after a long time, it had the taste of dahi and besan both in optimum ratio. Bhindi chana was mouth watering, crispy bhindi with soft warm chapatis. Their rice were freshly cooked with each and every particle properly cooked. And the best thing was i got all of these in just 440rs with Zomato gold. Thanku silbatti, will love to visit again."
1.0,was there yesterday for lunch with my friends..I havent checked the bill properly and you guys have added service charge including the item which I havent ordered.. just now I have checked the bill n Im totally fedup with this. If u want i can share the bill. Nobody can trust u guys.
2.0,"Food is really good. But the staff is so slow and inefficient. We ordered and waited for 20 minutes, later the same guy came and took the order again saying he needs to confirm. Pathetic"
1.0,"Worst experience we have order dahi ke kebab n got WORMS in that dont know how dirty their kitchen is we have been to silabti before also but on weekend n their is not much lighting today we went on Monday n sat at a place with pretty much lighting, so can see our plates clearly pathetic thing and the staff have no courtesy to say sorry and one of the staff member was smiling WORST !!!  I dont wanna give even 1 star if zero gonna be the option Ill opt for that"
4.5,"The ambience was good here, the food was alright. The wait time was a little too long. The place felt like a dhaba on a busy street yet the feel was close to that of the real thing. I would recommend the butter chicken here and steer away from the seafood as it lacks the taste."
4.0,"Loved the food here, it was delicious. Tried chicken tikka , paneer lababdar, murg dum biryani, and some mojito. Presentation was excellent, chicken tikka was very tasty must try dish, watermelon cooler wasn't as expected. It was just Normal watermelon juice. When we entered this place, it was already full, we had to wait sometimes to get seat. Everything was superb but disappointed with the service, we had to wait long time till they serve food."
4.0,"Overall great ambience, nice sitting, good music, great food. Green chutney wasn't very good. Staff looked a bit confused at most times. Service time can be improved a bit"
1.0,"Avoid this place. It lost its charm. Service was horrible, food was uncooked and staff ended up serving our food to another table. The worst part, when they realized, they took the food from that table and served us. What a horrible experience it has been."
3.0,"The ambience is not very pleasing. Non veg food is not up to the mark, although vegetarian food had great taste. Food is served slowly. Since prices are high, we also expect food accordingly. Please improve your range of mocktails. Kebabs and fried nonveg starters lack in spice and good taste."
3.0,"Ambience and Cleanliness: 3.5 They have regular chairs n tables, low rise sofas, and desi cots setup.  Service : 2 Pathetic, either they are always short of staff or that's their standard. By seeing others reviews looks like they take their sweet time to take the order, and then serve the food.  If you can improve your service and the increase your staff , I'm sure your business will increase.  Food & Price: 4 The quality, quantity and taste of the food is good. Price is obviously the catch point, especially for the location and also considering the number of other restaurants in the locality."
1.0,"Ambience is too good, thats the main reason we stick to the place for more than half an hour without food. It took 35 minutes for them to serve the starters. Horrible management!"
3.0,Place has some good appetizers and drinks...main course was okay(which is why rating is 3 stars) Ambience is okay... Its usually crowded on weekend and their service is slow... Nice to try once in a while...
5.0,Awesome place to dine in food is delicious   Worth a visit... Enjoy!!!  Just it will be better if you pre book your table otherwise you need to wait for half n hour minimum
4.0,"Visited this place for dinner. There was a long queue so u better reserve early. In food we ordered paneer kadhai , masala kulcha and berry pulao . They all were delicious. Ambience is nice . Proper place to go with family and have food. They have different sitting arrangements. Service was too slow. They should increase the count of waiter. Reducing one star for service."
4.0,"Ambience - It reminds you of a North Indian Dhabha- low seating, bamboo chairs and tables. Water is also served in earthen Bottles  Food  Paneer Achari - Huge Paneer Cubes marinated with Achari masala and served with a chutney . Taste was good  Rumali Roti and Naan - The roti was so soft. One of the best in Bangalore  Paneer Lababdar - This dish was recommended by a lot of people on Zomato hence decided to try it out. Oh boy, it is one of the best Paneer Gravy Dishes I have ever had. Thick Creamy and tasty. Pairs perfectly with the Rotis and Naans. Must Try  Cost - Rs 600 for two ppl is a steal deal. We also ordered some Drinks like Nimbu Paani and Shikanji so this was very good. This place has a Zomato 1+1 on food which is an added advantage  Final Verdict - The moment we reached this place we realised that it was a gem by the number of people waiting for a seat on a Sunday Night. We waited for atleast 20-25mins to get a seat. I will surely go back to try their non veg food"
4.0,"SILBATTI gives the real feel Of DHABA. Inside the city. It feel like you are hanging out in the middle of your way long trip.The sitting arrangements are really superb,but yaa to be avoided during rain. Nonveg platter is one of the most tempting dish and will make you feel like having more and more.As having chicken, mutton , fish and prawns arranged beautifully with commendable flavors together.The Jaljeera drink was a great refreshment with a tangy and sweet taste to accompany the dinner perfectly."
4.0,"Food is good, liked the stuffed kulcha. Their aam panna is good, atleast during the seasonal times. However, the service is terrible on weekends due to the heavy rush. Would recommend doing a reservation to avoid long queues."
4.0,The ambience of this place is quite unique. The sitting style makes you feel right at home and provides a relaxing atmosphere even in the middle of the hustle bustle of the HSR layout. The food is good and the service is prompt and coordial.
5.0,"Came here many times, but this I celebrated my wife birthday. Service was really very good. Chandan from silbatti was helpful and professional."
4.0,"Busy Day for the restaurant today! Almost an hour of waiting and an hour of follow up for the food. Waiters were a little in some another zone and were not able to respond to any questions. The managers were way too busy handling the crowd. Overall ambience is good..food is the only plus point. We ordered dahi kebab which was quite good, tomato dhaniya shorba was really sweet otherwise tasty. Banarasi dum aaloo is a must try!"
1.0,"Its a nice place, but management is horrible. Be prepared to wait for really long hours unless you are going on some really odd time. The waiting time is a lot not because there is too much crowd, but the management is horrible. We wrote our name, when they informed 20min waiting time. They made us wait more than 40min to get our table. After ordering they made us wait another 50min. That's too much. Not just us, many people were waiting for their food. They dont have any queue system. Someone else ordered the same thing after us, got it early. So its clearly a management problem. Think before you go there on a weekend or holiday."
2.0,I can't think of any positive thing for this place. I have been to this place twice. Was disappointed both the times. Food quality and taste was not good. Had tried achari paneer and kaju masala . Achari paneer was very tangy. The service was very slow. And also they made us sit at a place where there was no light and the seating arrangement for that table was like the one they have kept outside for waiting . I really would like the management to give a thought on how to treat their customers and also to think about the quality of the food they are serving .
5.0,"Went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon the food was good. Starters were good, especially gilafi seekh. Ajwaini fish tikka was okay, not that great. Paneer tikka was soft and very good. It was my first time that I had Laal maas and it tasted very nice. The Aadhi gosht biryani was a breath of fresh air in south India. Typical north indian biryani and I really liked it. The place is nice and gives a good dhaba feel,but avoid the place on a windy or rainy day. Only complaint is, service is on the slower side."
3.0,Had booked a table but when we went there we were told its Saturday no bookings can be taken. After speaking with the manager they agreed to accommodate us earlier which was almost an hour. The services were really slow and the food took forever.  Was disappointed with the food as well.
5.0,"It is very amazing restaurant, gone for team lunch booked half an hour before it will be more good in evening We have order mutton and chicken taste is so good, best part is service even we are 20 people still food came in no time and quality of the food is maintain very well even there is so much rush Love to come again..."
3.0,Veg food was not very great but the service was very bad. Had to call multiple times for same stuff. Would not recommend this place again. Ambience was ok with a different look.
4.0,"We went for lunch on Sunday noon. In starters we ordered ajwain fish tikka-it was okay not so great Pepper chicken-it was tasty but pieces were of bone nd big, gilafi she ek-it tasted awesome, paneer tikka-was good. Main course laal maans nd chicken vindaloo were amazing. Awadhi ghost biryani was great but cheese paranthas were okayish. Orange mint lemonade is a must try. Place is amazing nd seating arrangement is also very comfy,"
3.0,"After hearing about this place from few friends, I made it few days back. One must go here is if you want to enjoy eating in a different ambience having a village touch. Food was fine, the quantity was also good. I did enjoy eating out at silbatti.. If it's rainy then you might want to check a proper seating."
4.0,The service was pretty slow in the restaurant but totally worth it. All the dishes were really mouth watering. The ambience is quite different from a regular restaurant with less seating options and hence it's recommended to book a table in advance.
5.0,"Awesome food and awesome ambience. Have been there 5 times and each time we tried different dish, each dish turns out to be fantastic. Specially waiter Chandan is good at recommending the dishes"
4.0,This place is amongst the place not to be missed. Ambience gives you the feel of beach sack. Loved the food and service. If you are foodie then please make visit to this place for great value for money. Overall good service and quality. Recommended place!
4.0,"Headed for dinner on friday night,nice ambience place is different and village style dhaba.They have different seating arrangements felt little excited seeing but not so comfortable. Tasty food ordered chicken kebab platter 4 varieties served with 3 pieces each and chicken biryani Service was bit slow Like the water being served in the clay pots"
4.0,"I was planning to visit this place from 5-6 weeks. Booked this place 2 times through Zomato and cancelled at last moment. Finally this Thursday we visited this place and believe me it was great experience.  The booking confirmation was done within few minutes and got seats at perfect location ....Outdoor sitting ..From where you can see moon through tree branches under small small umbrellas. It was damn beautiful. And on other side you can see movie on big screen which they show by using projector. The ambience is like a village...Khaat, lamps and trees ...Just wow.  At the entrance you can see cart full of spices ..Which looks really good.  Now coming to what we tried. Starters :- Dahi Ke Kebab - Filling of it was perfect. But lil more fried than required. Cheesy Roomali Cigar - It was awesome. It was combination of mushroom and cheese covered in a roll. Just perfect. Must must try.  Main Course :- Pindi Chole - It is Dry Chole with lot of masala. Bit sweet it was. If it not spicy instead of sweet it would have been great. Aloo Parantha - It was good. Well stuffed and prepared well. Suggestion : Add butter and coriander chutney. Cheese & Onion Parantha - It was also great. Great taste. Cheese was bit less.  Drinks :- Coke - What to say. Coke it is  good it was. Orange Lemonade - Orange juice with mix of mint and lemon and ice cubes...with pieces of all the items in it. Damn awesome it was. Must must try.  Desserts :-Gulab Jamun - It was combination of Gulab Jamun and Rum. I feel Gulab Jamun was good but because of Rum it was damn bitter. Better have Rum and Gulab Jamun separately if you wanna get drunk. Don't mix.  Overall experience was above average.  Cost and Service:- Service was quick and staff was warm. It was reasonable according to ambience and food. Cost was Rs 979 after Zomato Gold discount of Rs 200."
1.0,"Its an ok restaurant, food was not as per North Indian standards. If you are looking for North Indian vegetarian food, this is not the best place"
4.0,"Good ambience with a wider choice of items. Punjabi items are a must try. Kalmi kabab, paneer kulcha, panner tikka are items you should try out."
5.0,"It was worth a wait, of odd 20 min, before getting a table in the suburban kind of setup with Jute-rope stitched Char-Payi's in the middle and Indian-sitting area in one corner where you can sit amidst array of colorful umbrellas, oil lamps & earthen pots. Inside, the experience is not to rush but to try the northern cuisine which is both economical and high on spices . The starters were particularly good!"
4.0,"Food- starters are highly delicious, specially the dishes like Til Dil Kebab, Veg Cigar very innovative names with traditional dishes with some added uniqueness.Ambience- Really good ambience for a nice calm dinner outing not many tables so might have to wait for sometime.Service- It is good with friendly staff."
4.0,"We decided to go to this place on a Sunday night after consulting zomato of course and it was jam packed. So after waiting for almost an hour, we finally got a table. The ambience is decent enough with dhaba kind of setup. The staff members were really patient and courteous. The food was awesome. Starting from appetisers to main course, everything was really great. The lassi was really yummy and a must try. I have deducted a star because of the waiting period and if it rains theres no arrangement for people sitting under open sky."
1.0,Service was Slow but Staff were courteous.  Be prepared to consume a lot of Baking Soda in the dishes they prepare.  Waiting time to get a table can be anywhere between 15 to 30 minutes.
4.0,"Ambiance is awesome!!! Inside it's like village dhaba!! Different option you have to pick for your seating arrangement such as khat with open sky or low rise chair or normal chair.... I like the water jug made in clay, which keep water cool!  Food qulaity is very good even if quantity too. Tandoori chicken was delicious... it's vert soft and it should be in your must try list. We ordered Chicken as well as mutton biriyan and chicken butter masala. They served biriyani in clay pot, which is nice and tasty. Mutton or Chicken pieces in side biriyani is quite big and well cooked.Lassi is very good.  I am giving one less star because of service. They need to improve the service a lot with this price. They started serving main course without starter."
5.0,"The Biriyani they serve is one of the best. When i say best, i mean best in quality and quantity as well. For the huge and humongous person I am, it serves lot more than just sufficient for me. But for a person who eats normal, will find it difficult in finishing this whole handi of Biriyani. Needs 3 people for 2 Biriyani.  Apart from that, i love the ambience more in the evening since the lights bring in a better effect. The music is always bollywood, which suits their theme. They have movie screenings on Thursday nights which is also good. Expect a wait time of 10-20 mins on weekends for dinner."
3.0,"The only good thing about this place is ambience, that too if you are into it. It has a traditional dhaba kind of aura to it. The service is extremely slow, starters not at all great. The mutton shorba and butter naan are extremely good. Dal tadka was barely ok. Overall not a satisfactory experience"
5.0,"We decided to got out for dinner and hit this place. This place has a dhabba kind of setup. Few seats available in open air, rest in side under roof. Coming to food, the taste of food was very good. Staff were courteous. Food - 4.5/5 Staff - 4/5 Ambiance - 5/5"
4.0,"The aura & the vibes here are more or less like a VILLAGE, absolute Dhaba feels :D On my recent visit we ordered: Mutton Rogan Josh : I am a die hard mutton fan..and there mutton rogan josh is delicious. Butter Naan: soft, buttery..just how they should be. Chicken something : I actually forgot the name.However I have attached the picture below, it was highly pleasant to the taste.  Must try : Mutton Roghan josh"
4.0,"Nice place, nice seating, nice food. But the servers are kind of lousy. Took them 2-3times to take the correct order, even for water also we had to keep giving them reminder.. But the food, ambience was great despite this"
5.0,"Polite Staff and Delicious Food  We were 12 people in total, they managed it pretty well. Till Kebabs and Malai Kebab is amazing. Must Try"
2.0,"The place has downgraded a lot in terms of taste as compared to what it was when it was newly opened. We ordered dal makhani and malai tikka, which is authentic punjabi food but taste was not good."
3.0,"My Rating will be 3.5.....Travelling 19 km from place of my residence to silbatti was justified after having a very good dinner at this place. Village styled dhabha  type Ambience was decent and added flavour to the evening , i ordered Veg Platter which was good, Paneer Lababdar was amazing. Roti, Kulcha and Naan ordered in breads was well prepared.. Subz Biryani served with raita was also good. In mocktail, fruit punch was ok, but peached ice tea was not well prepared. Overall i would definitely recommend this place for north indian food. Parking is not an issue."
3.0,"My rating -3.5 stars  Ambience - not great! Its a good effort with umbrellas hanging and the low seating.. but somehow it doesnt look so fresh.   Location - is great! 19th main road is one of the foodie lanes of HSR and parking there is not an issue.  Food - Good!  Couple of things did not live upto the expectations, but rest was great!   We had -  STARTERS 1. Ghee roast - not something i would order here.. i have had much better ghee roast at other places.  2. Mutton sukka - This was good.. well cooked and tasty too.  3. Veg platter - paneer and dahi kabab were really good and would order these two again. The mushroom roll was tasty but a tad bit oily. The aaloo kabab was spicy.   MAIN COURSE  1. Laal maas - perfectly cooked mutton dish. Something i would highly recommend for mutton lovers.  2. Kadai chicken - i have had the same dish twice and somehow the second time it was not that tasty. It was chewy and not juicy enough. The gravy was tasty but that did not seep through the pieces.  3. Paneer lababdaar - AMAZZZING! Just loved it.  4. Malai kofta - It was good enough. Not for those who do not like a sweet gravy.   5. Phulka & tandoori rotis - they were good!   I have visited silbatti around 3 or 4 times but my experience has been inconsistent. But its a very comfortable location for me so i frequently land up for a quick lunch or dinner.  They have zomato gold so well, that is always an added advantage."
4.0,"Awesome food if you are in mood to have punjabi food. restaurant has village kind of ambience, which deserve its own points. weekends its overcrowded best time is to visit them on weekdays"
4.0,"North Indian in HSR? This is the place to go! Good food, right price. And something about the ambience that makes you go there again and again.  Breakfast however was very disappointing. Cheese paratha and chai, both were not good. Poha was just about average."
4.0,A great place to dine in! Ambience for dinner is just great... full North Indian DHABA style! And the food is great! Have been here more times than I can count and got home delivery twice as much. Everything I've tried here is great but Dahi ke kabab are my favourite. Must try that.
4.0,Great food. The ambience looks like a dhaba which is is all thumbs up for me. I dont remeber anything that I didnt like about this place. Go to place if you are looking for hanging out with your friends and family. Good vibes all around
1.0,"I went there today for breakfast, didnt get my order after 1 hour also . Had to leave the place without food. . I will never go back to this restaurant"
1.0,The food is pretty average. The staff especially the manager is very rude and discourages u to come again here. We had order starter and had two zomato gold He dint agree to take  Such cheat and fraud activities must be curbed  We ordered cigar roll n tawa fry both were oily and we found out hair piece from the food. The onions used for salad were stale n smelly
4.0,Ambience is more like a village style or dhaba .Food served is really good.Staff is very polite.The only glitch we experienced was food wasnt really served on our plates but we were charged 5%service charge. Service charge is fine but service should also be there. As far as the government rules go its not a compulsion to pay a service charge & customer should be asked about it .When we asked the manager he was pretty rude and told its compulsory.Please get your facts right service charge is optional and you cannot levy it on the customer. Overall the place was good.
4.0,"Food - food was good which is did not expect.we ordered mutton keema ,chicken kukkad,veg handi and dal makhni. Best food out of the lot was mutton keema Needs improvement- breads of any kind served by them .  Service -servkce was slow and it cannot be blamed to the staff as they were evidently streched and we're not in numbers as per requirement.  Amboence-theg have given it a feel of a nukkad shop whilch is okay."
1.0,Never deliver order on time when ordered online. Take 2 hours for order delivery which is shown as 30 mins . And its repeated story be it swiggy or zomato. Delivers cold food . Avoid ordering from here people a honest suggestion.
1.0,The food was ok but they don't value Zomato gold membership. Before placing order I checked with waiter about zomato gold offer but at the time of billing they didn't gave proper discount and I end up paying complete amount
4.0,"The food was generally good. Dahi ke kebab and cheesy roomali cigar was excellent, however, the veg galouti could have been cooked better. Zafrani malai kofta was also very good"
4.0,"Love this place for its atmosphere, service and food. Amazing delicacies from the Northern land.. Gets the texture, aroma, flavor all to the mark for a relishing meal. And, just love the idea of Thursday evening movie shows. A typical city dhabha."
4.0,"After being recommended by few friends, we landed here recently for lunch and it turned out to be an awesome experience. Before even getting into the food, let me mention about their ambiance which is quite different. Its kinda open space giving a bit of village and dhaba type of look. The khatiyas and colourful umbrellas at the centre adds to the beauty. Wooden chairs and tables, water in clay jugs are there to make a difference. The service was quick and courteous.  On food, loved the Shahi Butter Chicken. Probably one of the best Butter Chicken that I would have had in the recent past. Went really well with the Butter Naan. The Awadhi Mutton Biriyani was also made nicely. The Mutton pieces were so soft and tender.  This place is certainly going to be in my regular visit place for some delicious North Indian food. Would also try out their Buffet Breakfast sometime. I believe they play some classical Bollywood movie every Thursday evening. Looking forward.  Happy EATING!"
4.0,"We've been here once for dinner and it was a nice experience. The food, service and ambience are all good here. You are supposed to dine out in the open so make sure you wear something warm in case you visit there in a cool weather. If you are planning to visit on weekends then make sure you get the table booked in advance as this place has about 30-35 minutes of waiting time in case you show up without reservation.  Coming to the food, we had ordered Dahi ke Kebabs, Dal Pancharatna & Bhaja Platter along with Tandoori Roti. Dahi ke kebabs were moist and flavorful but I didn't find them being up to the mark. Dal Pancharatna was simply awesome. We literally cleaned the serving bowl  It was really yummy. Bhaja Platter's flavor and taste was nice but the variety of veggies was limited. It was more of eggplant slices. We had expected some range of vegetables. Otherwise the spices were perfect.  Service was good and the waiters were polite. As far as parking is concerned, you can park the vehicles outside the restaurant, that is, on the main road itself. We didn't find any issues with the parking.  In short, we would surely love to go and dine here again  Food: 4/5 Ambience : 3.5/5 Service : 4/5 Value for Money : 3/5"
4.0,"Although the place doesn't have decent ambiance their food is really tasty. Service is very slow.  We had the Kebab platter, Paneer Tikka masala, Dhania Adraki kukkad. Also they have a lot of options for mocktails. Love to visit again!"
5.0,Very good food. Ambience is Okay Okay  Service is little dull. But everything is covered by the quality and taste of food. Keep up the good work guys!
4.0,"Good north Indian and mughlai food, love the decor and the staff is friendly and well trained.  Do try: Murgh pudina tikka, dal makhni, dahi kebab , butter chicken"
3.0,We ordered Dal chawal and chicken Tikka which tasted ok . But Fish we ordered tasted really bad. I don't think the food matches the price tag.
5.0,Chandan the best guy over there. The reception is awesome. Service is very quick. Great place to relish indian food. A highly recommended place always.
3.0,I liked the ambience. Good of its own kind. Kinda open and outdoor kind of.  Food is just OK to the taste buds. I just liked only the Malabar prawns curry.  Staffs need to be groomed. Food was provided after a long wait of 40 minutes  A good location in HSR
5.0,"Amazing taste... If you are looking for north indian food in hsr layout, then you should try this place. Nice ambience gives you dhaba feeling , staff are really nice with smiling face. I loved the place, people n food."
4.0,"Searching for a North Indian Dinner and decided to visit Silbatti. It was looking decent from outside and when we entered inside loved the ambience. Simple arrangement of seating, cutleries and best thing was water in clay jug.  Ordered Tandoori jhinga and kalmi kebab in starter. Kalmi kebab was perfectly made and tandoori jhinga was a disappointment. Though it was cooked in tandoor still it was bland in taste.  Main course we ordered Malabari prawn curry, Gosht biryani and couple of rotis and kulchas. All were well prepared with perfect balance of spices.  Service could be bit prompt and we had to wait for a long to get the food. Zomato gold is a major plus point of this place of course food and ambience also.  Food-4/5 Service - 3/5 Ambience - 5/5  Will visit soon."
2.0,They have to work on their main course option.Food was not prepared properly and used the same gravy for almost all.More options need for veg starters.
3.0,This place is OK in terms of ambience and service if you are in for casual dining. I tried chetinadu chicken fry and masaledar chicken lollipop in starter which was average. Murg Biryani was good and can be tried.
5.0,My all time favorite Cheese Cigars butter naan and Alu dam benarasi.. they are best here... Nice Ambience very open space and they also have movies played once in a week... Too much crowd on Saturdays so do keep time to visit.
3.0,I would say this place is average but being in the prime location its easy to go. Its economical and food is avwrage tase not so good. Honestly they need to improve the service and seating arrangement for large group specially.The best which I liked was cranberry pitcher it was just awesome.
4.0,Nice ambience.. Tasty food and friendly staff.. In silbatti you will find all these.  Really liked the sitting arrangement and food taste yummy.  Good going keep it up. Looking for other visit soon
4.0,The name itself defines the place very well...Great north indian food at affordable price..The staff members also provided good service..Overall a nice place to visit with family and friends..
4.0,"Peaceful ambience with soft music and very delicious food ,worth going here !! I loved the orange lemonade which had a natural flavor of orange with pinch of chat masala was so mind refreshing ! Also the achari matki subzi was something different . Tandoori roti was very soft and delicate ! I would really suggest this place."
1.0,"Pathetic food, Mutton was outdated and it was stinky. The one who took order behaviour was rude. The entrance superviser guided to a table and the other who takes order said - this table is boooked and cant give you. When I went back to the entrance he guided back to the same table. Over all Pathetic experience and ruined my weekend with my family"
4.0,Had been here multiple times and the taste of food never disappoints. Everything on the menu I tried was very tasty and was well presented. Staff is courteous and ambience is nice as well. Only one downside is having to wait in weekend as it becomes extremely crowded.
3.0,"We ordered Achari Paneer ,chicken tikka ,kadhai chicken and dum biryani.Chicken tikka is a must try here. Kadhai chicken was also good but apart from that ""Achari Paneer"" and ""Dum Biryani"" was average."
4.0,If savoury is your thing the silbatti is your place .. the open space is definitely a great place for people to catch up and have a good time ... Namma Bangalore kababs definitely where one of our favourites... kali murgh and a classic chicken tikka... a must go place if ur it to open spaces n game nights.
3.0,"Food is good, we ordered Paneer pasanda(for our kid) and Sabz Achari (spicy) for our self. Quantity is sufficient in each serve. Taste is good flavours nicely blended. Ambience is decent, avoid sitting in open during rainy season. Service is poor, from getting table to serve food it took exactly 39 min, That too when we ordered main course only. With starters it'll be more."
4.0,The food was good.. the veg n non-veg mixed platters were delightful.. the laal maans and roomali cigars is a mouthful of yumminess.. the dhaba kind ambience in the middle of the city is an great weekend getaway!
1.0,"Food was below average. We ordered chicken adrakki , gravy was not cooked well. Too much salt. We could not eat. Kept it aside. We were still hungry, next we ordered rice n dal. Rice was not cooked appropriately. We left it again. We informed the owner. Went out and ate in different restaurant to fill our tummies. Never ever we would like to come back to silbatti.  Although Owner was kind enough to give 15% discount, we were expecting full refund. Anyways ignore this restaurant if you dont like spoiling ur taste buds."
4.0,"If its your first time or if you havent tried this before, then you must go and try bharta, Rara chicken and their  twisted mock tails, its amazing good with desi ambience."
5.0,"I liked it a lot. Full marks got ambience, service and food quality. We ordered ghee roast chicken, murgh vindaloo and tandoori rotis. Ghee roast chicken was wonderful. It's a must visit and within budget."
4.0,"I went with my family to this place on Sunday for dinner. When we entered the restaurant, it was almost full & we had to wait for almost 20 minutes for table. Ambiance is pretty good. They have desi dhaba kind of theme. First we ordered Non-veg soup of the day. I don't exactly remember the name of soup. But I can definitely say that it was one of the best soup I have ever tasted in my entire life. Then we ordered Chicken Tandoori & Ghee roast chicken wings for starters. Both the dishes were delicious & up to the mark. For main course we ordered Shahi Butter Chicken & Butter roti. Shahi Butter Chicken was amazing. Overall all the dishes we ordered were fab & value for money. Service is also very good in this restaurant. Looking forward to visit again very soon."
4.0,Went on Sunday evening. Place and ambience is ok. Food is good. I ordered paneer lababdar and dal Palak which was really tasty.  I found service little bit slow and inactive. I asked 4 times for a bowl. For which I came to know after half n hr that they dont give bowl for dal. Little strange but overall it was worth for money.
4.0,"Silbatti - A name so Indian that it sets expectations really high. The moment you enter the place, the aromas from the tandoors will surely hit you pleasantly and your mind will tell you that you could be in a for a excellent meal.  I recommend that you visit on a weekday as they are pretty crowded on weekend especially evenings.  The setup is dhaba style and the service staff is polite, but they can be a little more observant. The food service is fair, not too quick not too slow..  The chicken gravies are pretty good, I loved every bit of the creamy butter chicken. The Dal too was pretty good. Interesting bread options to choose from too.  If you are looking for a good Indian meal a must try place."
5.0,"Great experience , enjoyed the soup of the day and rawa chicken and and butter rotis suggested by attender , courteous staff and topping of that jalzeera and sweet lassi was awesome , thumbs up ,keep up the good work"
3.0,The staff is polite ..food is decent ... On Thursday as per display they play a movie @ 8 pm ... That's why we went there ... However no movie was played ... I also asked them to play .. But they didn't ... I didn't like this attitude of them..
5.0,Searching for a lip smacking north indian food in hsr and glad we found this place! Totally dint disappoint our expectations!A busy place for sure luckily we got the place with out reservations.The ambience gives u a dhaba feel and a lot of ventilation with rustic style.We ordered the non veg platter... Oh they were cooked perfectly and we're fresh and tasty.Then the biryani was served very nicely and tasted well! The orderes were delivered on time and pretty active staff!Had some wonderful stomach filling food here.And I would love to visit this place again.
4.0,"Me and my friends are the frequent visitor of Silbatti. Ambience is good on rating of 3/5. We had tried many dishes, out of that in starter chicken reshmi Sheek and ghee roast comes on first in the list. In main course Chicken Takatak is good. Chicken Tikka and butter Masala is not up to the mark, kind of OK. So in food 4/5. Now only problem is that you have wait atleast 25 minutes to get your order. First of all they you give you the starter on first 20 minute after that that to get the main course it will take at least 20 to 25 minutes. So they need to work on service as service is slow even in weekdays as well."
5.0,Awesome veg Platter. Cool ambience and place where you can spend nicely with very good quality of food. Hindi songs playing in the background. Nice place to hangout.
1.0,"chicken dum biryani could have been a little less spicier ( less masala for the amount of rice will be better).....(previous review)  18th Nov,2018 - Had ordered til dil kebab, kadai murgh & gajar ka halwa. The chicken in both dishes was hard and chewy. It was not cooked well and the chicken itself seemed to be of dubious quality ! Gajar ha halwa was like a poor cousin of any decent halwa you ever had. The carrot not grated fine, the flavours missing and no richness whatsoever. Pathetic !!!"
2.0,"We went to silbatti on a weekday so it was not very crowded and got the seat at the same time. We ordered Paneer tikka for starters and kumbh matar in main course. Paneer tikka was not cooked properly, it felt like they showed tandoor to paneer tikka seekh from a distance and served it. We informed about the same to duty person but the attitude was it was kind of ok. Kumbh mattar was nice and rotis were reheated. My suggestion would be to avoid going to this place on weekdays and inform them in advance that whatever u ordered, u want it cooked."
4.0,"Silbatti is great for last minute plans. We like the outdoorish seating and good service. Parking is almost never an issue and you can easily find a spot in front of the restaurant on on the opposite side of the road.  The seating is a hit or miss. They have a few booths with very low seating along with a host of regular tables and chairs. There's also a couple of quaint ol cots used as seats. Go with whatever is comfortable for you. I prefer the regular tables as it's less of a hassle.  Coming to the food, we've been to this place several times and have had an opportunity to try out most of their menu and suffice to say, everything is good. One particular combo I enjoy is the Butter Naan with Baingan Bartha and Butter Chicken. May sound a bit weird, but somehow it's a combination that works for me. Normally, I hate Baingan Bartha and am not a huge fan of butter chicken.  Not a huge fan of the lassi here as it tastes like there's too much syrup.  For pan lovers, there's a stall right outside Silbatti.  P.S: At times, mosquitos could be a menace."
4.0,"The traditional Indian and quirky touch to the entire ambience is what will make you fell in love with the place at the very first step.  The dried Indian spices kept in the round earthen pots on a Yellow eye catchy rikshaw & the macro size Silbatta is what fulfills the name of the restaurant "" Silbatti"" on the first go.  My ratings:  NON Veg Shorba : It tastes good with all the Indian tastes. The flavour of clove hits ur throat so well that you would love to have it again and again.  Fired Crispy Chicken  The taste of Onion & Crispy Curry Leaves leaves a very good mouth watering flavour to your taste buds.  Butter Chicken  Not too sweet , not too spicy.  Masala Kulcha   Service   Ambience :  A small yet a well managed space . Devashish Negi"
4.0,"After hearing a lot of negative reviews about this place, I thought I'd give it a try just because I've been meaning to for a long time. The ambience is quite chirpy and Indian. Love the little umbrellas in the center of the space, quite comical they look.  If you're in the mood for pucca desi/punjabi food, come here. We tried a LOT of items from the menu because we went in a huge group.  We started with some lassi and masala papad. Both of which were good and as expected. We tried everything from butter kulchas to Trikon Wheat Paratha (is that what it is called?) All of the Indian breads were good.  In the gravies, we had Sabz Kolhapuri, Paneer Lababdar, Kadhai Murgh, all of these were incredibly good! Perfectly spiced and seasoned. A good meal for lunch.  I would totally recommend this place for a nice cosy seating and good, hot desi food. No frills and pretty good service. Recommend. I'm glad I gave it a go."
1.0,Pathetic service and the staff declined to use Zomato Gold. This is the first time some restaurant in Bangalore refused to accept. No proper place to sit and degraded food quality.
1.0,Chicken tikka had bones where it should be boneless. The curry was also not smooth and has chuncks of onion.
1.0,"Food was tasty, but I got many stones in sabji, please be cautious when you guys prepare food, my teeth could be broken due to stones in chhole sabji."
4.0,Have been here a few times.. The food is good and the staff are friendly.. The place is crowded on weekends so its hard to find a seat.. Reservation is recommended on weekends
4.0,"The place is really good....but if you go on weekends you need to wait for an hour at least as there is too much crowd and that's when there service goes for a toss and food tastes also gets reduced... otherwise the food tastes really good . They have maintained the restaurant with an appropriate care. Need to work upon service timings, service was a little slow in the weekends... However, overall a good one, one should try this out."
4.0,yummy
3.0,Ok
4.0,"Hello Friends,  I stepped into this restaurant with one of my friend in an evening . Immediately stepping into here what i saw was the lightings. Which made my evening . It was peace ,no noise out there . Perfect evening place.  Coming to food i ordered chiken tikka in starter, which taste was good but quantity was bit less. Then i ordered chiken taka tak in main course . The taste was really good and the quantity was also good. This was awesome when i tried it with butter naan .  As per my satisfaction,I would like to rate this restaurant as below :  Ambience :4/5 Food:4/5 Service:4/5  And this place is easily accessible from HSR bus stop . Give a try"
4.0,"Food is really good, ambience is good, Only thing they need to take care is Service.. I can say its not bad, however I think need some improvement in service.."
2.0,"So this is what you serve for 340 . speaks volume. I came.here to dine out again thinking i might be able to change my perception, but ws highly disappointed yet again."
1.0,the quantity of kasundi machi tikka is very less.. for 250rs its giving us only 4pieces.... Why should we spend 250rs for this.... Disappointed
5.0,this time awesome
1.0,"We ordered chicken tikka masala which was really pathetic. Very filthy smell was coming from curry. When we checked with chef, he denied and was trying to proof us wrong. Went with great expectations but all in vain.  Will not recommend at least for chicken tikka."
2.0,People in their reviews touted the Dahi ke Kebab and Paneer Lababdaar. I found them both not very great amd were okiesh... have had better than what they are serving here...
2.0,"I visited Silbatti on a Sunday Night. The craving for North Indian Food, Zomato Gold and nice Ambience were a factor in shortlisting this restaurant. The place was fairly crowded and some people were waiting outside for a table. Thanks to online table reservation i did not had to wait outside. The ambience was very nice and it looked like a fancy comfortable dhaba. I did not like the food that much (Vegetarian). Initially I had ordered the soup of the day which was a Mixed Veg Soup (had 2 spoons of it and couldn't eat more) and Bharwan Kumbh. They served the soup within 2 mins and it was bad. As it was a soup I was expecting some chopped pieces of veggies to be in it, but what actually it had were pieces of green chilli only. After waiting for 10 mins the manager came and informed me the the Bharwan Kumbh was not available as well they were out mushrooms (it was only 9:00 pm). So I ordered the Dahi ke Kebab (okay, not that great). Post that I ordered the Zafrani Kofta (amazing), Bhaja Platter (horrible,burnt and overcooked), Pineapple Raita (the saviour), Garlic Naan (don't ever order), Rumali Roti (nice,well prepared). Next round .. Desserts. I selected the desserts from the menu and called the waiter to order, at which point she informed me that expect Gulab Jamun nothing was available in that category. No Gajar Halwa, no Phirni, no Shahi Tukda only Gulab Jamun. So we had to order the Gulab Jamun (good, not worth Rs.160). Seeing the Ambience and Menu online, I was having high hopes from this place. But the food which was served and the actual items which were available really disappointed me. I was hoping to rate it 3, but then the wrongly calculated bill was like adding fuel to the fire. Ratings:- Food : 3 / 5 Available items in Menu : 2 / 5 Ambience : 4.5 / 5 Service : 3.5 / 5"

4.0,"Nice breezy Ambience...but a little uncomfortable seatings....when we got our first order Appetisers: Cheesy roomali cigars, chicken tikka, malai reshmi seekh have awesome flavours... Mocktails: Among the mocktails we ordered, the one which was really worth having was Roohafza. Mains: Among mains, Murgesh rara and handi was good."
1.0,not good. food seemed to be not per expectations. Aaloo paratha seemed like a maida paratha with NO aalu!
4.0,"Excellent music collection is the best part of this place. Hindi melodies dominate their collection. Food is excellent,. Chicken ghee roast vis a must try, never thought ghee can add flavor to chicken till I tried this. My connoseaur friend also thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Its dessert section needs some improvements, most of them being unavailable. The ambience is set in open space, and mosquitoes will slightly bother you, it's the price of open dining and acnt blame the restaurant. Visited this place multiple times, and service and food has been consistent."
4.0,slightly oily
1.0,"I ordered chicken tikka masala, it was hell spicy, was not able to eat gravy at all. Moreover it was  just normal chicken cooked in gravy and not chicken tikka."
4.0,"Yesterday I visited this place. We have ordered ""Awadhi""gosht biryani which comes in a pot along with raita and gravy, taste was good. Also we ordered some fish for starters but the quantity wise it was very less and taste was also ok ok."
5.0,First time here. Started with Ghee Chicken Roast was good. Awad Ghost Biryani was amazing and Fish was soft. Ambience is a plus and courteous/helpfull staff.
2.0,"Went to Silbatti with a group of friends. We ordered a chicken tikka masala, chicken taka tak along with tandoori roti and naan. Going by the description on the menu, we were hoping that chicken gravy dishes would be delicious but we were might disappointed. Both the dishes were bland and tasteless. Even tandoori roti was a little hard. The person taking care after us agreed to change the roti but we were almost done by then.  Service and ambience are good. Prices are reasonable as compared to other similar restaurants in HSR.  Overall, did not liked the food hence going with 2 stars."
2.0,The packing was pathetic all sabji had leaked half of sabji had fallen off. I paid so much and I get this. however many times I have ordered from here this is first time I observed this negligent packing
5.0,awesome food. delivery is good. good options in Pallette. :) happy to order again.
3.0,"Went to Silbatti, HSR after searching online for some North Indian breakfast point. The timings are from 7:30 AM onwards to 11 AM. Limited but good options for breakfast are available with unlimited Tea and Unlimited Juice (Juice was not available the day I went) There were little rain showers (drizzle) while we were enjoying the tea, was a pleasant experience.  Ambience is set back and relaxed and one can enjoy the breakfast peacefully. Water is served in clay pot.  Tea: Unlimited tea can be ordered. Though I prefer masala or ginger tea but here they served Elaichi tea which was equally good :) Every sip to be enjoyed with chuski :D  Chhole Bhature: Chhole was good, not spicy enough but overall good. Bhature were a little on the crispy side (bit brown) and little oily (problem solved with tissue paper though). Same is served along with onion and achar and is a good breakfast overall. Bhatura quality can definitely be improved more though  Poha: Served with namkeen and peanut chutney, it was good. Peanut chutney was tasty and onion and lemon were added in a balanced way to compliment the taste of the Poha."
4.0,Awesome food. Good ambience.  We ordered seekh kebab and it was very tasty. Seating arrangement is good. Would definitely like to visit once again.
3.0,"Silbatti is my all time local fav in hsr. They are incredibly desi, I love that they play old Hindi classics. Their veg peanut kababs were amazing, try their bread basket. I found it really healthy. I wish they had some Indian twist cocktails too:-("
2.0,Smell in food
3.0,"The place used to be very good but has detoriated a lot lately. The waiters are not attentive, the service is too slow. The taste isn't too good either. The ambience is satisfactory, gives it a village feel."
2.0,"hanging umbrellas and choice of music are inviting.  Otherwise, Dirty glasses. Anthropometrically wrong seating. Nothing special about the food. Overpriced for sure."
4.0,"Visited this place on sunday evening, it was reasonably crowded. Food was good. We ordered til dil murgh, achari mix veg n rotis. Mix veg was very good, til dil murgh good n thepla, pudina paratha were very good. And the prices are very reasonable. Will definitely visit again."
2.0,I really didn't like this place. I wouldn't recommended you guys to go there and waste your time. The chicken here was like rubber. I wasn't satisfied with it. Mutton was soft but it wasn't great with the gravy. The ambience was good. That's what I like about the place. It gives a good vibe. Service is also fast and good but what's the point if the food isn't good. I wasn't happy with my experience.
3.0,Potatoes in aloo subzi did not taste good. Rest of the items were good. Methi paratha and chole was very nice.
3.0,"This place decoration is village style .. if managed properly this would be one of the must go place . interior is good but a lot of mosquito ruining the experience service is pretty bad non veg special soups are more like chicken stock it was very disappointing orderd a non veg platter ..serving style was bad plate size was regular moton test was good , chicken was average . Main course was good .I would go with 3 taken out .5 coz of bad experience due unresponsive service"

4.0,"Reviews could vary person to person! Me being vegetarian, wot I like here is :: Quite a good village type ambiance. Nice food too. I would rather suggest them to have lil more vegetarian dishes."
3.0,"Really wanted to visit this place from long..finally made it for today's lunch. Firstly, seat given to 2 of us was not appropriate. It was congested between other tables. Size of table was so small that we have to get onions chutney and tissue box get removed to place starter plate.it was smaller than the coffee table required. While ordering..2 starters which we chose were not available..the third one stuffed mushroom something.. was okok.. lassi was 4+ ..then we ordered a Biryani.. it was totally like tava pulao one would better get on streets or local shops of Bangalore. The salan served with it was more like alu tamatar sabzi's gravy. Highly a mood off on saturday afternoon.."
3.0,Ambience is good when compared to food.We have ordered chettinadu tandoori chicken and Bengaluru kebab.The tandoori is disappointing with overwhelmed vinegar taste.We ordered biryani and some chicken gravy dishes.Biryani is okish and gravy were below average.Not a place for non vegetarians
2.0,very less gajar ka halva
1.0,"i had ordered breakfast including Aloo Paratha and cheese paratha, but it was the worst i have had till now. Silbatti is a very good resturant but what they served today was not at all good. I'm sure I won't be ordering breakfast any more from them."
4.0,"Walk into a nice little atmosphere which has a lot of colorfull surroundings giving it a village feel. Walked it on a hot sunny day and the buttermilk, golas and lassi were on point.  The food did not dissapoint at all. Had some craving for biryani and it came in a nice little mughali bowl and tasted pretty good too. Starters did not dissapoint either. Little on the spicer side.  Must visit!"
1.0,fish could be better in taste  devastating packing
1.0,They could have charged for plain paratha instead of aloo paratha as there was no aloo in aloo paratha. Ridiculous!!

5.0,Good food  Very Homely food   Devbrat very nice setting for a restaurant in the heart of HSR.   Loved food with the Kishore Kumar songs played out     Lamb sheekh Kabab was succulent  So was the Kashmiri Pulao and the Chicken Chaap  Loved the Gajar ka halwa to complete the dinner
3.0,"Second time: I went down to this place expecting a different experience than last time. Nothing changed from my side,items are okayish, service wasn't great either. Not a good experience,I must say  I wish I cud visit this place but it's always buzzing with ppl in line to get inside. So,I ordered food from here,chicken curries were just okayish,heard a lot abt this place but the food which was delivered was nothing worth mentioning."
3.0,"Taste is Good, potion was smaller, packaging could be better."
3.0,"Ambience : Nice , you can take couple of friends and enjoy the place. My personal best is the old golden songs by Kishore Kumar, being an ardent Kishore fan I have to mention :)   Another nice touch is the earthen water pot.  Service : Staff are courteous but service is typically slow. We had to wait for more than 20 mins and multiple reminder to get our starters  Food : Lamb Sheek Kabab and Kali Mirch Tikka were ordered as starters, to be honest they are poles apart. Lamb Sheek is probably the best of what we tested and Kali Mirch is that bad if you compare with a five start starter like Lamb Sheek   In the main course we had Kashmiri Pulao, Garlic Naan, Chicken Chaap and Chiken Butter Masala. Kaahmiri Pulao was the best of the lot, chicken chap was not at all good. Quality of chicken is also not at all tender.  In dessert , we tried Gajar Ka Halwa, quantity wise its good for 3 people considering most of the people now a days restrict sweet intake. Dessert is definitely not their forte.   Overall - It is a nice joint for a VFM food, the place is not prepared to take care of rain as its not covered between the kitchen the sitting area. Though the service guys tried their best to protect the food, still it could have been done better."
3.0,Ordered tandoori chicken as starter and Mango lassi and orange lemonade.main course ordered was roti with malvani chicken curry.tandori chicken was average and without much flavour.Mango lassi and orange lemonade was refreshing and good. malvani chicken was flavorfull but roti arrived late so was cold.finally ordered sizzling gajar Ka halva as dessert which was ok.overall ok but not great
1.0,late delivery

5.0,Awesom Chicken Hara Pyaz and Super Awesom Paneer Jaituni Tikka !
2.0,"The food here is very oily in general. I had butter chicken and murg taka tak. Both were just too oily for my taste. If butter chicken is a yardstick for gauging non-vegetarian dishes, Siltatti failed at it miserably."
3.0,the same item during dine in had better quality and quantity. disappointed.
1.0,"Again no chutney was provided. Ordered food worth 1400/- and basics like green chutney, onions, tissues nothing was provided. This is my such second embarrassing situation infront of my guests."
1.0,Service is very slow although the staff is friendly. Order one of the starters and hope that the rest of the order comes.. wont be coming back here or recommending it either
4.0,"Silbatti serves you wonderful food along with a very relaxed ambience. Choose your seating from chair/benches/charpai and feel home. Thursday are meant to be movie night and that means typical 90s movies which makes you big time nostalgic. Known majorly for their chicken delicacies, we thoroughly enjoyed their mutton biryani which was prepared in awadhi style. Being from Lucknow, its hard to find a biryani in awadhi style in bangalore, but silbatti really made us happy and satisfied. It is not a fine Dine restaurant so do not expect 5 star service or ambience. Food - 4.5 Service - 3.5 Ambience - 3.5 Value for money - 4"

1.0,"Live Review: On a peaceful Saturday evening, the urge for Northern Indian food brought us to Silbatti. This is not my first visit to this place however it might turn out to be my last. We ordered tangri kebab, kadai chicken, aam Panna and regular selection of breads. It took them 45 odd minutes to get the starter which had three leg pieces of tangri kebab. It was under cooked so we had to return what was left of the two pieces and the third whole piece. Then after ten more minutes we were served the main course. It was no different. Improperly cooked and bland. That's when we were served the single leg piece of tangri kebab, redone. When I tried checking with the server, he informed me two pieces were well finished n this was the third piece that was returned by us and he went straight to the point that it would be definetly added to the bill. QUITE THE SERVICE! Ambience : 2/5 Service : 1/5 Food : 1/5  This quality of this place has drastically come down n disappointed me. Not coming back!"
2.0,"Taste of food is good, but terrible service. Not just once, but consistently pathetic service. And no staff there is bothered about it. Few times they served stale food, and no one there was apologetic about it."

2.0,"This place used to be good. It has changed a lot in last 6-7 months. Chicken lollipop and chicken malvani were really pathetic. The quality of food has downgraded drastically. There was a swarm of mosquitoes buzzing around our table. In addition to this there were not so rare sightings of mole, rats, lizards which really makes me doubt the hygiene of this place."
2.0,"The ambience is fun at the first glance, with typical dhaba feel.. but the problem is this place is infested with mosquitoes which restricts you to enjoy the place and food ! All the dishes were pretty average in terms of taste, though the quantity is decent."
3.0,Bhaighan ka bharta was tasteless
4.0,"Nice place to hangout in HSR area specially if you have a Zomato Gold.  The ambiance is good resembling the old time fooding places.  The food is also good. We had a Chicken Biriyani which was good but not the best.  Only pain here is that if you visit in night time, there are too many mosquitoes so it would be better if you visit the place fully covered ."
4.0,Today I went to the restaurant with my friends and we order mostly the chicken dishes .. that starter was too good and the chicken with gravy was also good... will go again ..
4.0,"Small petite place with open dining, gives you a slight dhaba kind of an experience. Went here to try the Ramadan stall they have put up. Ordered chicken biriyani and haleem. Biriyani was great, haleem was decent. Didn't try the dine-in but the menu is decent and has good north indian options. Overall a decent place and not too heavy on your pockets, one plate biriyani and haleem costed us ~280/-. Try it if you want to experience Ramadan food and are not willing to go all the way to Frazer town.."
4.0,"This place serves lip-smacking authentic North Indian food. We were 2 people and ordered Tandoori Chicken(half) for starters, Kadar chicken, pudina paratha and garlic naan.  Everything was good but tandoori chicken and pudina paratha were absolutely delicious. Portions were generous and we had a tough time eating everything ordered.  4.5 - Food 4.5 - Service  3 - for punctuality, the place was not ready to serve at 7pm as mentioned and we had to wait 30min before getting seated."
4.0,"We decided to try out the quite popular North India restaurant, Silbatti located in the heart of HSR Layout. It was after several recommendations when we chose to have our Sunday lunch at the restaurant and ordered the following.  Chicken Tikka (Non Vegetarian, Appetizer): Extremely well made boneless Chicken Tikka, but the presentation was a little set back since it had some oil spilt over. It was less spicy, so be careful if you are a fan of spicy foods. Make sure to try them with Green Chutney, which we had to ask them to get.  Malai Kofta (Vegetarian, Main Course): The gravy was amazing and so were the koftas within it. They were well blended and complimented each other. Must try for vegetarians.  Malvani Chicken Curry (Non Vegetarian, Main Course): It was well cooked, but somehow the gravy didn't go well with the chicken. Not at all spicy, again.  Murgh Rara (Non Vegetarian, Main Course): The dish was one of the best which we had ordered. On a little dry side, but you'd love it with some Butter Naan. Must try for non vegetarian medium spicy food lovers.  There was a Mango Festival going on, where in they were offering Mango Lassi and Mango Panna, so if you're lucky to go there during the summers, do give it a shot.                                             virtuaniz.com"
1.0,"it's Sunday afternoon, four of us went for lunch and ordered food. we had a sudden surprise in mutton biryani, a big cocroch welcomed us. it's very bad experience we had at this hotel, just imagine how we felt when a cocroch found while havind food in middle of our lunch... staff were saying sorry about it, but that doesn't matter."
1.0,Ended up our family dinner time with empty stomach. We really hv no idea how all ppl r coming here for food. A worst Nd slow service even with less crowd. Food was at its worst. Fish kabab was so hard like made it on yesterday. Tandoori chicken was stinki. Kaju Pulav with not enough taste Nd Kaju. Kashmiri Pulav was just like masala rice. May be the worst family outing in our life. I wanted to give -Rating but no option for it
4.0,Visited Silbatti on Saturday afternoon after being heard by my friend.  Ambiance is different and unconventional for a get together. Foods are tasty and nicely served.  Staffs are courteous and friendly.  Foods 4/5 Ambiance 4/5 Staffs 4/4  Thanks
5.0,"We decided to try out this place because we had heard good reviews from a friend and I must say Silbatti exceeded our expectations.  We ordered Rotis, a chicken starter and a chicken gravy. The starter, Til Dil Murgh, is by far the best starter I have had in my life. Do give it a try if you are a chicken person! The gravy, Chicken Vindaloo, tasted more like chicken in tomato pickle, which we ended up liking too.  Special mention to the dhaaba ambience. Kudos team!"
1.0,"Half the items in menu were not available. We went as a group of 15+ and the waiters could not handle the orders. There where lot of confussion , got many orders wrong and service was slow. Taste was ok with most items. My suggestion don't go there if you are going as a group."
4.0,"Good place, good ambiance and good food!! Visited this place last night, and had to wait for half an hr for a table. But the wait was wort it. The staff was overwhelmed with takeout orders, table orders and people waiting and trying there best to look after everything. And we got our mains served before the starters, but the food was good, so no complaints!!!"
4.0,"We got to the restaurant at 2055 and got a table at 2140 , on a saturday night without booking, so book before going. The wait aside we ordered butter chicken , chicken dhaniya adraki and garlic butter naan And one starter of tandoori zinga. Since it was the first visit we wanted to stick to familiar foods. First the starter came after we have finished half of or main course and secondly the size and quantity seemed less. The chicken dishes were good but nothing extraordinary. I would recommend the butter roti than naan. The decor is easy going . We landed up during the mango festival. The lassi was decent, a bit sour for me but liveable and lovely malaiiiii. Over all a 3.5 or so. CS"
5.0,. Extraordinary food with good service by waiters. . Ambience is nice. . A GOOD Theme restaurant in HSR . Good management skill of manager . Sea food dishes are selected but extraordinary taste
4.0,"For the pre beginning of weekend (Thursday), if you are bored and want to catch up some movies that have left legacies behind, this is your place.  In addition to the varities of food items, the highlight here is the cart with all spices and condiments just at the entrance that speak about the wonderful taste of the dishes. Also a variety of mocktails and desi drinks available. (by desi, restrict yourself to Lassi, Aam Panna and Buttermilk please. Pouvva is not good for the liver and this place makes you gear up your Punjabi Liver to lick the plates).Another eye catching sight is the earthern crockery. Specially the water storage in earthen bottle will give you such a soothing vibe after having the water that you will buy the same very next day, just like me.  A dhabha kind of feeling right in the heart of a metro city. Vegans are welcomed to enjoy but being non vegetarian I would recommend all ave eaters to try precisely the tandoor items. A taste that remains at the tip of the tongue."
4.0,"When you enter this place it's modest ambience gives you the feel of a modern dhaba. When you enter, you can see carts with raw mangoes which instantly makes you feel you have left the city behind and entered a village dhaba. This is one of the most economical places and with Zomato Gold applicable, it's an icing on the cake.  Let's come to the food now. This place won't disappoint. Frankly speaking I had heard so many bad reviews about this place from my friends and colleagues that I had second thoughts of going here but once I went inside and tasted the first dish, I was extremely pleased that I came there.  We ordered one vegetarian kebaba platter. These were so flavoursome, we could not resist ourselves from ordering one more.  The next we ordered one ""subz dum biryani"" and ""Anda biryani"". Being an eggetarian I tried both and both were equally delicious and had completely different flavours . The veg biryani was full of spices and is a must try.  The last we ordered was ""Sizzling gajar halwa with vanilla ice cream"". This rightfully competed our desserts quota.  Being a foodie I was really happy with this place. Although I gave a star less because of service. The food used to take a lot of time to come and especially for the dessert I think we waited for like half b hour or so. Everything was great."
4.0,Liked the food... Yummmmmyyyyyyy.... Staff was in full speed.... took a little while to server food (but that ok) Ambiance was good enough for the food. Mango fest was there. All over PAISA WASOOL....
1.0,pathetic food it was rotten and bad smelling food
3.0,"The food was decent but the service was something that they need to take care. We were served the main course before the starters, which was odd. Seating preference should have been asked before being assigned a table, as we found the cot to be uncomfortable to eat"
3.0,Food is good but didn't accept the order soon. Had to wait for quite a bit long
1.0,"Pathetic service. Taste is below average. Ambience is average. Staff are not friendly. We have ordered panner lababdar which wasn't good, bindi masala was ok."
2.0,"the delivery time was more than 1.5hrs, the food was cold by the time it reached our door."
5.0,ordered the dal makhani meal. roti and dal makhani were yumm!
3.0,I was giving 2  but one extra  for gulabjamun. trikoni roti was not cooked well.
1.0,"Bad service. We went there and for more than 15 minutes, no one took our order. Thrice we called the server, he came and asked for 2 mins and left. We saw him loitering around and taking orders of people seated after us. At this point having reached out of patience we walked out."
1.0,very very bad service...order delivered more than 30 mins after expected delivery time...after that we found incomplete order...will never order from this restaurant
5.0,"Very good quality. Small quantity, may be due to the offer price."
5.0,Went there with my friend. I like the place. Their interior feels like a village dhaba where I used to go. We had one veg biriyani and a non veg biriyani. Both taste good. The quality and quantity are good. Love this place. We wil visit again..
1.0,"Just avoid this place!  Unless you love dining with mosquitoes, and are a fan of food on the undercooked side, and love bland tomato flavours in form of gravy, and of course paying a lot of money for it. In that case, go for it."
4.0,A nice place in HSR to have pleasant dinning in HSR. The ambience is different from normal restaurants. The food was good had been with vegan friend so no much comments ;) But ya the items in list looked and tasted new. Slight premium to be paid for premium feel.
1.0,"A north Indian restaurant the ambiance of a dhaba. It has an open seating with khatiyas (beds) as a sitting option. We just chose to hop on them and after a few minutes we realised that they were quite uncomfortable as the tables with them were not a good match and so we asked to change the seats but we were denied instead of some tables being empty. The staff there is arrogant and doesnot know how to serve. Coming over to the food, the taste is just average. We ordered tangdi kabab first which the waiter told was not available after placing the order for over 30 mins. Then we went on for some other options in veg and non veg section. The only thing good enough is the chicken tandoori. And then in the last to complete the pathetic experience, we had to ask waiter to revise the bill thrice. I would like the management to improve their service to provide the guests with the comforting experience which one seeks while visiting a restaurant."
1.0,orderd a ghee roast and silbatti special both tasted like achari chicken . very bad food . wasn't a good experience at all . service good but yet lacks in food .. used zomato gold but I guess they did that because of that .
3.0,"The advertisement claims dat you get chiken combo @99 Rs what costs originally 304 Rs. When i got it delivered, found d the quality was good however d quantity was not as per d commitment given in ad. Very less quantity not even sufficient for one person. This is a kind of fake advertisement. Am wondering that does the restaurant(silbatti) serve d same quantity of chiken combo @ 304 Rs in regular days."
1.0,Butter chicken had only 1 piece of chicken and was not event tasty.
4.0,butter chicken was good paratha they would have boiled it little more
1.0,ordered butter milk but got salted lassi.
4.0,Silbatti is always a great option for my family because it has something for everyone.Went again yesterday a bit late and still enjoyed the food(must have is veg galouti kebab)although there were way too many mosquitos  will always look forward to the next time.
1.0,Very horrible..... People don't even receive the calls instead they keep their phones switched off...then for what Joy have they given their numbers is doubt! Very bad experience!
1.0,"food was horrible, extremely oily, tasteless. ordered a chicken and fish dish. chicken pieces were very tough. one of the fish pieces was smelly, guess it was spoilt, had to be thrown away. all in all not a good experience. won't recommend."
3.0,Quantity of dessert can be and should be more. Taste wise good food
5.0,"I was skeptical about quality and quantity of food given it was on offer, but Silbatti didn't disappoint. Food was of good quality with no compromise."
1.0,"Fell for their today's offer by Zomato. One small piece of chicken - just about the size of a spoon. Watered down butter gravy, paratha which are half cooked. Street sellers offer much better food for 99. Terrible."
3.0,"Have been to this place multiple times. They are not at all consistent, an item ordered today will taste completely different the next week. My suggestion is to go only for their starters, specially masala fried chicken and ghee roast"
5.0,"amazing preparations at a reasonable price. loved thr bharwa mushroom and paneer lababdaar. definitely recommended.open space, so can go with kids also."
4.0,The ambience was good.service and food was good..great hospitality..mocktails need to be improved...if you are a north indian food lover must visit
4.0,"nice theme n food. but being a open space to sky in middle, too much of mosquitos will spoil your mood. also service is not upto mark. but the food is awesome, value for money. u can also enjoy movie on bigger screen on every Thursday"
1.0,Hawaiian Sharbat was missing from the delivery items. And again the liquid items were not packed properly. It's like you don't care a lot about the way items are delivered.
4.0,Food is just amazing.. mouth watering.. Ambience is proper desi.. u will love it..one must visit this place atleast once.. great place for north Indian food.. customer service can be much better..
3.0,"A Dhaba themed North Indian restaurant situated in HSR. visited it once during lunch and found it's over air theme quiet attractive but during summer or sunny days bit hot. So revisited during night time and had to wait for 45mins to get a place for dinner. But end result of wait turned to be good and pleasant. Its a pleasant experience giving Dhaba like feeling and good food. Callouts- Kulcha, Rogan josh, sikanji and kebabs. If you are are North India food lover you will definitely like it. Try visiting over dinner for a good experience."
4.0,"Wherever used to go to hsr, always seen a huge waiting line outside silbatti. Finally got a chance to visit it. To start with, it has retro look with feelings of village to some extent. Lighting is not that bright, on entrance they kept a khaat. Sitting is divided into many categories, table chairs, khaat, and sofa. The have bottle shaped suraahi on each table made of mud. Though the staff is a bit mismatch, was expecting them to wear some ethinic dress and t-shirt and jeans. Coming to food, soups has very less options, only veg/non veg soup of the day. We tried Mutton shorba, but be careful as spoon might be very hot for first sip. Then we ordered starter, good portion and taste. Even the presentation was good. Then we hopped to main course, naan has three portions here so be careful while ordering,as one might be enough for most of us. No long waiting time for food, all came in quick time."
3.0,Open restaurant. Nice seating to enjoy with friends. Different type of set-up. Try or go for non veg food which is good but do not try ordering anything for main course in veg. Most of them are not good. Do not try veg soup. Service is slow. you need to wait and call them again and again to place order or get you served
3.0,"silbatti was reffered to me by Rituparna Konwar.  so my wife and I decided to give this place a try.  we chose to have dinner on a weekday.  as soon as i entered i realised seating might be an issue....as they had placed palang as seats to get a feel of dhabha or of your usual north indian campfire. but what they didn't account for was the tables appropriate for the palang.  we sat on it out of curiosity but soon asked to be seated on a conventional seat. seating is alightky towards being less comfortable.  and did I say is an open air restaurant?? That is a plus point.  We ordered the usual north Indian stuffs like a tandoor starter, then a butter chciken and naans.  naans were a big disappointment. as they were cold.  remaining stuffs were of average taste and hence will not be getting into individual rating of those.  but its a good hangout place of you have kids with you."
4.0,need food to be little more spicy
3.0,"I have been there twice in the past few weeks. I really like the set-up of the place. Made me remind of Dhabas from North India. Coming to the Food, My second visit was more of a disappointment from this place. First visit : Dahi ke kabab were okay as I know every restaurant can't make them like they should be. The kebab's were oily and stuffing was not even. sizzling paneer was good and so was Naan and Tandoori roti.In the second visit, I ordered Murgh Pudeena tikka, It was ill cooked from inside so was a big disappointment. We ordered Paneer Lababdar however what we got was not the recipie for Paneer lababdar but Kadhai paneer. I even asked the waiter to check however he mentioned that it is Paneer lababdar only. So I guess they need to check their recipie again . Though the kadhai paneer turned paneer lababdar was good in taste."
3.0,Went to silbatti.. The ambience is good with nice music. The staff are courteous but it takes a little time for the food to arrive. The food was good but not so great. Can visit for casual dining.
3.5,"Nice Ambience, lovely food, though the serving would have been  must faster. Overall a good experience nd recommended during IPL as they cover the match."
2.0,Chole was spicy and besant ka phool was blunt in taste... Delivered late.
1.0,"I'm sorry to say that your food was so horrible.. I have eaten chicken ghee roast in many restaurants..what you served I don't know , it wasn't ghee roast  ."
4.0,"Nice place, good and differrent ambience for dhaba type feeling. Food was awesome. Only thing is that there's a waiting period of minimum 30 mins during weekends. Also service is little slow during rush hours. If you have time, this is an awesome place to dine with friends."
5.0,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Great ambiance, great food. Butter Garlic Naan is just Mmmmmuuuuuaaaaahhhhhh. Great food as well as service. good smiling staff is always a great gesture."
5.0,"Being in restaurant business for some time, I can imagine how difficult it is to give a even an good experience on a saturday night. Right from getting into in waiting queue via phone to having food, they managed it quite well. When it comes to food, they will provide you authentic north indian with right amount of spices and you are going to feel it. We enjoyed Dhaniya Tamatar Shorba, Achari Paneer, Bharwan Khumb, Lachcha Parantha, Roti, Butter Naan, Dal Makhni, Paneer Tikka Masala, Boondi Raita, Lassi & complementary Sirka(Vinegar) Pyaz :). All together it was a nice experience. I am sure on a regular day they will even be better.  PS: Don't expect sweet food that we get in most of restaurants."
4.0,"While searching for something new found this restaurant. Visited with mixed psychology that average taste food will be served. We ordered achari paneer as starter, n that first bite of paneer changed my mood as that was so delicious and had complete home made achar taste. We ordered veg kolhapuri in main course and trust me, i nevethad such yummy veg kolhapuri in Bangalore. It had flavor of spices with mix vegetables. That's a must try. Vwg dum biryani was average as compared to others. Improvement is expected for biryani.  Ambiance wise this place is small with different type of sitting arrangements. Nicely decorated with basic stuff.  I liked it and visit in future soon."
1.0,I specifically asked to pack the liquid items properly so that they don't spill on the way. The pack is completely soaked. IS IT A JOKE??
2.0,"We had ordered Paneer Lababdar. While the delivery was on time, we didn't like the taste much. Paneer didn't look fresh, and the spices in the gravy seemed uncooked."
3.0,Ambiance was good.Food taste was okeyish.We ordered Aloo badam tikki it turn out to be a disaster we had to order another stratter as it was really bad. You get modren dhaba feeling and Old Hindi songs played. I feel price was little high. I feel they should improve on the staff management.
1.5,"Even though the ambience is good,  the service is not that great. Ordered for Mixed Non-Veg Kebab Platter and what they served us is different from what they had in the menu. When we asked about the same, the person-in-charge came back with the excuses like menu has errors or the item mentioned in the menu is over etc. Basically we didnt get what we asked for. Also please find the pic of ""Matka"" Phirni."
4.0,"A good place for authentic North Indian cuisine. Ambience adds to the authenticity with village like layout. We tried Gosht rogan josh,chicken kali mirch tikka and garlic naan. All the dishes were very good. Mint lemonade goes well with all these dishes."
4.0,"Love the food, love the ambiance. Good value for money and great service. Must try, Romali roti, shahi butter chicken and dal makhni. Brilliant North Indian."
3.0,"Visited Silbatti for a light meal. They have tried to organise a dhaba-like ambiance which looks quite nice!  Coming to food, I ordered the aloo badam tikki , peas mint pulao and dal tadka. Tikki turned out to be a disappointment, but the pulao and dal were good. Expected better from this place..  The staff needs to be more well trained.."
5.0,awesome
1.0,"the worst place possible. they are plain inefficient. you sit there for 45 minutes and no body comes to take your order. you call them, they don't listen. this is an awful place. don't come here if you can't wait for 2 hours. empty plates is what you will have after 45 mins"
1.0,"I feel this place is mood spoiler, this was my third and last time I visited this place every time it is getting worse. extra 5% service tax (when people shout on gov for GST) nd food taste nd quality was super bad. we two people could not finish what small amount of food we ordered. Bad bad bad don't try this place strongly recommended don't visit."
3.0,I can go on and on about this place and the food. Superb decor.. Amazing food.. Ordered tandoori chicken.. Which had the right blend of spices and perfectly roasted. The service is quite swift and the servers very welcoming and cordial.. Loved the experience.. Will visit again
5.0,Its an Indian themed budget restaurant with a few cots for people to sit on and dine. The waiters as well as the food was nice. The music they were playing was from the 80s. Its an ideal place to get your parents to. Im sure they will enjoy the ambience and the music. There is also a Paan shop right outside.
3.0,this is my first time in Silbatti amazing place great food so very nice place food is good taste chicken dum briyani... very good service keep it up.....
3.0,"Very slow service. Food 3.5/5.. Was billed for one item that was never ordered but they were very prompt to refund the money, except that i had to drive down there from my place which was 10kms away.. good ambience.... insects flying around (due to weather) they should have fly killer.. either they should have more staffs or taking orders and serving the same should be managed by the same person..."
1.0,"Been here twice and on both occasions, the taste was bad. Last time I ordered Alu Paratha for breakfast and it was bad as well. Appears a no go to me."
5.0,"Amazing Place for Great North Indian Food, Service and Ambiance. Been there few times , the food taste and services is always great. very friendly & quick service. food quantity is good enough.  Food - 4.8/5 Service - 5/5 Ambiance - 4/5 Value for Money - 4/5"
2.0,Ambience is good especially in evening. We ordered soups which were not good.  Starters Achari paneer okish Dahi pakoda okish Buttermilk lot of green chillis so it was very bad we asked for replacement but again it was the same.  Main course Palak panner pathetic Veg kolhapuri pathetic Rotis were good.  Service was delayed due to rush during weekends so not well managed environment.  Ambience is very good with village like setup but there is lot of room for improvement in food quality and service.  You can go to silbatti for ambience and to spend some time.
1.0,"Okayish place in HSR layout. Not so authentic Punjabi food. Rude staff, didn't even listen to the complains! Even disagreed to use zomato gold!"
2.0,Starters tastes good but the employees are unprofessional. Ambiance gives the complete ethnic look. Main Course could have been better. Desserts are pretty good.
4.0,"If you are looking for a dhaba experience and in no mood to drive out of the city then this is the place for you. Right in the middle of HSR. They even play old Bollywood movies too.. There is three kinds of sitting arrangement. Sitting on chair, rope bench and cushion on the floor. We chose to sit on the cushion floor. If you fancy the same avoid sitting next to the kitchen as there will be lot of smoke. Very courteous staff. They serve delicious food on time and price is also reasonable. Overall the experience was really nice."
3.0,"Average experience overall. Detailing here: Food 3/5: Was good on most parts. Nothing to complain except for the insect we found in onions. That was one bad thing here. Service:2/5 Pretty poor, slow.  Ambience:4/5 There's a good ambience setting here Parking:3/5 Not difficult to find parking on road Cost:4/5 Near towards value for money"
3.0,"If you are missing that typical dhaba style ambience from the highways across punjab and north india, this is the place for you. Loved how these people have decked up the place. The sitting arrangement is varied and good.  That being said, food quality is not that amazing. We ordered amritsari fish and the pieces were huge and lit bit uncooked from the inside. The quantity was a major concern in non veg provided the prices.   Not a value for money place.   Ps: they have complimentary tea at the entrance ;)   Food-3/5 Ambience-4.5/5 Cost- 3/5"
4.0,"Get to Silbatti, if there's a queue then just sip some piping hot chai in a clay glass. Genius idea, makes time fly. The setting and ambiance of this place is very pleasing. Lovely lighting, retro Hindi music and beautiful umbrellas, what's not to like? Food here is impeccable. Try their mocktails, you'd be surprised at how good they are. I'd recommend the anardhana ras. I also loved their mushroom bharwan Kumbh and Kali mirch tikka. For something different try their dahi ke kebab. So yes, food here is quite delicious and services are warm quick and polite. The only part that I thought wasn't good, was their uncomfortable seating. Sometimes they may look all nice, but will give you the aches by the end of your meal."
4.0,"Loved the concept of the restaurant with the Desi touch. Content with the flavors of food, tandoori chicken lived up to the expectations. Courteous staff, fast service and reasonable rates!"
3.0,Sab badhiya hai ...upar chatariyo se lekar niche charpayi tak dal makhni se lekar paneer lababdar aur choti surahi ki chai se lekar har serve karne wale ki muskaan tak behad umda khraab hai roti lane me lagne wale samay waise tandoor m samay lag hi jata hai par itna nahi lagna chahiye ki bich m uth k do bar hum hath dho aaye :) samay Nikal k Jaiye aur pudina paratha aur dal makhni swad jaroor lijiye aur haan rotiyan ek sath order kar dijiyega
2.0,part of the items ordered was not delivered and had to escalate at night causing so much inconvenience!
4.0,it's a nice place with nice ambience and decent north Indian food.. it's pocket friendly but I was not a big fan of their drinks though.....
5.0,"Its the best vegetarian north indian food i have eaten in Bangalore, and only for the good food - this place gets a 5 star rating. Food Quantity and tastewise - this place is good. Good variety on the menu and mocktails are also good. Ambience is unique and different, but the staff can be better."
1.0,Very bad rating
4.5,"Silbatti is my go to place everytime I'm craving for some delicious North India dishes. With khatiyas, or, cots and a basic brick wall set up, the place oozes a rustic charm that is quite inviting. However, many may find the cots very uncomfortable to sit, so then you can switch to the dining table or the divan set up. Silbatti also has movie screenings on Thursdays, bringing back some of our favourites from yesteryears.  It's very difficult to hit a wrong note on the menu. It shows that everything is prepared with extreme love and care. My personal favourites are dahi ke kebab, basant ke phool and tandoori chicken as starters. I wash it down with a refreshing glass of kiwi buzz. They used to have a khus drink earlier but it isn't on the menu anymore and none of the servers seem to get it! But if you somehow manage to make someone understand it, do order it. Foot the main course, begin with the delicious aloo dum benarasi. I'm someone who likes to jump straight to the meat, but l cannot just bypass this one. No points for guessing that l then order the butter chicken and naan. Some may find the butter chicken a tad bit sweet so then you can go for the malvani chicken curry!  Oh and there is always a rush, so it'd be wise to book a table. Happy dining!"
1.0,Worst food. I Will never visit again. Women's day celebration gone wrong. Nobody liked food. We dint have a good experience first time either. Visited again. disappointed.
4.0,"Finding this place was a bliss! We chose Silbatti for it's ambience and rating. And yes, we were not disappointed!  The food here had an authentic Punjabi taste. The portion was good as well!   The only downside about the place is the loud Punjabi music they play to go along with the ambience."
1.5,"Mango lassi was a treat!!!!  But, Gosht Biriyani was horrible. The ambience was something they need to take care of, because of mosquitoes.  The staff aren't that great too.  Overall -  Food - 2  Ambience - 3  Service - 2"
3.0,"The only great thung about the place: Kiwi Fuzz The staff is confused, dont take orders on time and honestly the food isnt that tempting and something should be done about the mosquitoes there"
1.0,"Well I went there on a Sunday night n had to wait for smtime. The ambience and seating is good..and u would expect good food given the aroma that hits u when u enter. But the food was a big let down.. too spicy.. which was like literally everything we ordered.. -  til Dil murg, chicken tikka, paneer starter, dal..drinks were pathetic; they were basically sugar syrup. Service bad.. they were cordial but but we're not able to handle the orders. Got some breads post the dinner was Almost done.  G"
4.0,"Ordered a paneer lababdar, dahi kebab, roti and Lassi. Everything was good except that waiters sometime forget you once orders have been served."
1.0,Food is average.Service is very bad. There is no one to help during parking but they don't hesitate to disturb you while you are having food to ask to ask you to park your car elsewhere. Please make sure to check your bills. In my case it took three tries to get the bill right.
5.0,Taste is what we need in a dinner and along with dhaba style ambience made the time awesome. Nice location and staffs are very good and what we need.
3.5,"This is a pretty place which gives the feeling of a shack or Dhaba. There are separate chambers as well as a space under the sky. The best part about this place is that they have a movie night on Thursdays, which is a fun way of spending some movie time over dinner under the sky.  Chicken Biryani- The chicken biryani was prepared well and the quantity was quite a lot for one person. Chicken reshmi kebabs- Not a very satisfying plate of kebabs, it was a little dry. Daal khichdi- The khichdi was good, it was a little spicy with Tadka, not a light kind of khichdi if you are expecting it to be. It had vegetables too in it.  Overall: Food- 3.5/5 Ambience- 4/5 Service- 3.5/5"
1.0,"food is okay, but service is BAD we went twice, sat and Sunday both days many items in our order were not served even after multiple reminders. But they were added in the bill,, when asked why the item is added in bill when it was not served,, the staff brought that item in few mins instead of reducing that amount from bill. What would we do with it when we are already finished eating and ready to leave. Do they not have even that much common sense."
4.0,"Good place, Good food innovative menu and lots of choices to order from. Service is a bit slow maybe because i visited on saturday. Loved the food, will visit again"
2.0,"Visited this place, with colleagues for lunch on a Friday. Was pretty decently filled and we got our table without any hiccups. We started off with a Veg platter and a Pesto Paneer.  Surprise, all you get is spoilt and sour paneer - After a wait that felt like eternity. Though it was replaced later, that didn't leave a good taste. We also tried out their Biriyanis, Rotis. They were a pretty decent affair. The portion of main course, seemed quite less considering the price. Overall, the food was pretty okayish and not drool worthy.  Service was a tad too slow and not something one could appreciate.  Ambience - The look and feel of the restaurant was pretty cool, guessing it would be better in the nights. Would pass off as a decent ambience.  Overall, Food - 2/5 Ambience 3/5 Service - 2/5  A very average place, wouldn't regret if i don't get to visit again, unless they improve."
4.5,Today was a really hot day in Bengaluru and we are into this place where there is no ac and not even a proper roof. ..this was my first impression but once we settled down in the cost seats we relaxed...the staff were courteus and eager to help...we have ordered dhaniya adraki kukkad and murgh haara pyaz and thepla...the quantity was really a lot and the thepla were really delicious..overall I liked the place a lot
3.0,"This place is located on hsr 19th main road , you will easily locate it. The ambiance is quite pretty when you enter you feel like being at home, they have low level sitting as well as table and chairs.  Coming to the food first we ordered kala khatta gola in our drinks, I dont know what happened they didnt listen properly or what, they got some other flavour and when i asked after tasting the answer was khala khatta was not available so we gave something other, this was very strange they should inform us its not available if we wanted something else.  Then we ordered tandoori veg platter it had paneer tikka , dahi ke kabab, allo badam tikki and some cheesy roomali. Everyone was ok , dahi ke kabab could be more better.  In the main course we ordered dal makhani and achari matka sabji with jeera rice. Dal makhani was thick like typical dal makhani but the taste was not good could have been better, and achari matka sabji was nice. Service was ok which they can improve.                                                                 foodtravelpedia.wordpress.com"
1.0,"My suggestion is to not go there. They use lot of corn flour. Infact they even used corn flour for tandoori chicken and it was like a rubber. God knows what they were trying, mixing KFC into standard tandoori chicken.  The main course is bland. After finishing the food you'll get up with a feeling that you ate something but will have no idea what you ate.   Aha don't forget the mosquitoes who will bite you giving an itch so bad that you'll eat less and scratch more. Girls you be careful of these mosquitoes. !!"
1.5,"Went for breakfast on Sunday morning and ordered aloo paratha. The restaurant took more than half an hour to serve the order. I was running out of patience when the order finally arrived. Parathas were made in a hurry and were bad in taste. Apart from the super slow service, the place was also not properly cleaned. Could be much better than what it is right now. Need to work on service and hygiene."
3.0,Overall good food. The starters and other meal are little overpriced as relative to their taste and quality. Lassi is not up to the mark. Rice items are good. Dal is good. The potato starter is yummy. The theme is lovely and the songs being played there were making us feel as if we were in Rajasthan.
4.0,"Good food is the word I have when it comes to Silbatti. We love their aloo dum specifically, its prepared very differently as compared to others and very delicious. Even other curries are quite good. They however lack a bit on the ambience. The place has a rustic look which is nice but the cleanliness takes a toss, plus the place has much mosquitoes that interferes with ones mood for the evening. The music played is average and sometimes have technical issues.  All in all if you are looking for a quick tasty lunch/dinner, this place is good. But for a relaxed ambience, its better to choose others."
5.0,"The perfect blend of food, culture and style in silbatti. Silbatti presents a superlative menu of north Indian delicacies cooked to perfection in myriad ways. The delectable array of vegetarian and non-vegetarian kebabs and curried dishes straddles the many culinary legacies of India.  Themed like a typical Indian village. Awe inspiring ambience, supreme service, jabardast arrangement for dining , open theatre which runs every thursday Check out for the choice of movie you want watch. Starters are really great . Spices of your choice that's something very desirable when someone goes out for food. Skillful staff. Value for money. A MUST VISIT RESTAURANT."
2.5,"Spoiled my Sunday dinner. Beautiful place, bad service and not good food. They got under cooked starter and when asked to check they got main course and said starters will take time have it after main course. Didnt like main course either, also staff was too busy to listen to anything."
1.0,Very bad quality food...too much masala in every dish...even the drinks were bad.waste of money. There was a lot of waiting though.We ordered all kinds of dish veg nonveg starters main course and desserts.Nothing was worth that money.
4.5,Amazing food good service nice ambiance...been their twice for dinner nice place .they have tasty starters and main course is good.and reasonably priced .
1.0,Ordered 6 piece chicken wings. Server served 2 actual wings and rest 4 kebabs with bones. Ridiculous. They thought people won't recognise wings. I got it changed. Worst experience for me !! Minus rating
4.0,"paneer lababdar was good, garlicnan was half cooked"
4.0,"Good ambiance with equally good taste. Restaurant offers good variety of veg and non-veg dishes, I would personally recommend chicken dum biryani."
4.5,"Fantastic experience of Odia cuisine, a blend of Odia and Punjabi flavours and cooking spices. Great attentive service. I ate the most. The atmosphere is down to earth and have a desi touch. Would go back anytime! Priyabrata Patnaik"
4.5,Amazing food with retro style ambience. The whole presentation is cool and is supported with village serving. Be it Bamboo based tables and chairs OR dhaba styles Khaats.   Suggestions  Enjoy food and surrounding keep your phones and PDAs away.  Must eats are :  Pudina chicken (starter) Sarsoon/ mustard Fish( Bengali style) in main course.  Checkout the precise servings of authentic green and red chutneys...
4.5,"One of the best restaurants I have visited nice ambience good food cheese kulcha , gajar Ka halwa with ice cream , sheek kebab, murg biryani,"
5.0,Nice ambience. U feel like being at home. Food tasted great . I couldn't take the picture of starter as I was damn hungry and it was damn tasty . Service is great .
4.0,Typical dhaba style ambience and seating arrangement with old Bollywood music/movie playing on the giant screen. Food was good and the staffs were courteous. The only thing o would advise is that they should hire more staff so that they can serve better in case of rush.
3.0,I personally didnt like the food here. Except few things which includes hariyali chicken kabab. Rest all wasnt good. Especially in non veg. I didnt try veg but I heard its good at leastbetter than non veg.
5.0,Lovely ambience and great food. We happened to visit on a Thursday and it was the movie night. The spicy anar ras is a must try. Yummy food!
3.5,Good ambience . Food is nice but little pricey. Appetizers are not great and complimentary drinks are bad. Good place for a pleasant dinner.
4.0,"The colorful umbrellas add to the fun,lively and vividly unique ambience. It was fun to see the chefs tossing fresh rumaali rotis and later stuffing ourselves with Tangy chicken tikka masala. The winner was however the heart warming gaajar ka halwa. Don't miss it!! :)"
4.0,"The food was amazing....... And the music choice is fab............         It was tasty just that it wasn't on time.......  The ambience is beautiful and on a whole, worth visiting....."

4.0,The food and the ambience is great. It was a great experience. The gazar ka halwa being the best. The company was amazing too. Liked the umbrellas the best.
5.0,Good place to hangout gajar ka halwa must try..overall main course is nice ....different menu for drinks if u want to quench your thirst
4.5,"Had been here on a Tuesday afternoon......... Great food.................... Great music...................... Mr. Javed has been very supportive........................ Overall, great experience."
3.0,"Restaurant looks good. This lacks taste, quality n quantity. Need improvement in service, taste n quality. Taking all into consideration, cost is much more.."
4.0,"Nice family place with various sitting arrangements such as low side sitting, open area with khat and stool and the standard table and chair. Menu have quite lot of varieties to choose from each with ample amount of serving. Service was good though little negligent as we have to ask for glass ,straws, onion etc without the server bringing on it own.  We ordered  1. Dahi ke khawab - These were made from hung curd and were quite soft and delicious. 2. Cheesy Romali Cigar - These were cheese filled mushroom roll. 3. Kesar Malai Lassi - Very sweet  4. Rooafzah Lassi with rabri at top. 5. Masala Sikanji 6. Panner lababdar - Sweet and spicy gravy 7. Dal tadka 8. Garlic Nan and Clay oven bread with basil butter.  Surely worth going once and again."
1.0,"Out of my few frequent visits to silbatti these days, this was the worst one. As you all know the best non veg starter according to zomato suggestion in Til Dil Murg. I ordered the same like Everytime to get that mouth watering and the melting taste of the always best prepared dish. To my surprise, the chicken was not well cooked at all. It was stretchy and chewy. Spoke to the waiter, he inturn called the manager and then got me to speak to the chef. Even after explaining that the chicken is not raw but it is not done the way it is everytime. May be the tandoor was just set or it was too hot. I don't know. But neither the chef or the manager agreed that this dish was not as it should have been. Out of the 6 pieces, 5 pieces was untouched. The took back from the table.  To my surprise, they charged me for the dish. This should not have been the way of customer service. May be they could have offered a complementary drink if they can't make the whole dish free. Just as a good will. They did not. I even feel the manager and the chef had a sense of pride and egg while speaking to me that we are not liking a dish.  I paid the full amount and left."
4.0,"We went on mid of the weekday, restaurant was crowded n had to wait for the seat.. so definitely this restaurant is known by many.   4.5/5 Ambience is really good decorated in a simple materials in a creative way.  Can hangout with friends/family/partner , seating arrangement is good. Spacious and comfort.  At the entrance they display the spices in clay pot.   4.5/5 Service is also very good , waiters and managers are very attentive and friendly , serving the food on time.   4/5 Quantity of the starter is good. Gravy quantity is average. Over all taste of the food is good.  Soup options are very less. Veg n non veg together they have 5 soups options.   Good restaurant to visit again :)"
2.5,"Got interested with interior of this restaurant and wanted to give try from quite long time but that's the only good part.  Now coming to details - Mockdetails were giving quite sugary and watery feeling. Nothing sort of great. Paneer lababdar was tasting really awkward with feeling of spices remained uncooked. Bhindi in bhindi masala was quite stale and was full of beans. Samosa aloo parata didn't had any sort of samosa taste. Other breads were satisfactory but that won't help to fill in the hungry stomach.  Lastly services was pathetic, after ordering them main course at took almost 40+ minutes to arrive and that too after multiple follow up."
3.5,Was damn hungry when landed up here... Place is good and food was just how i wanted that time.. Service time is little longer than expected but overall nice experience :-)
4.0,Food was good but Pesto Paneer starter was very bitter in taste.
1.0,"It was the first time, we visited this place. Because the rating here is good so we thought of giving it a try.  So we placed our order from the very attractive menu and food was served in time.  But soon after we started eating an unknown guest appeared on table and the count of the guests kept on increasing. This unknown guest was a COCKROACH. I have attached photo of one of the guests.  Now I am sure that if they have cockroaches at the dining side think about the kitchen.   Best thing was when manager said it is second instance in a single day. Mere bhai, what the hell you doing then. You should have sorted it first before serving any single customer after the first instance.  Guys, I believe this restaurant is most unhygienic I had visited so far. Please consider before reaching out at this place."
1.0,I guess giving one star is also waste.... Such a worst experience... With this restaurant... Waste of money ....  Itna gandha food zindagi me nai kaya... Faltu me... Mehnath ke peisa tuk gaye... Chiii better koi math jao
2.0,"Food is good here, especially starters. And I have been here multiple times.  The service here is not upto the mark though.  Worst part is I was served a second hand tandoori roti, and when complained about it, they just took the plate away without even explaining or apologizing regarding the mistake."
3.0,"Food taste and quality is good, but the service is extremely slow , they take like an hour to serve a simple order almost as same time you get food when you order online."
1.0,"Sad food, late service. Had to wait for 20 mins before someone even served water. Chicken ordered was full of chilli powder and color. Disappointed."
1.5,"Excruciatingly slow delivery. We went in for breakfast on a Sunday. Ordered chole bhature, poori sabzi and poori halwa. All were the same and did not look very healthy. The staff trickled in by 10 which explained the slow service. A little over priced."
2.5,Personally I have visited many times there but every time I visit they degrade there quality of food. First time when I visited there I have ordered pineapple juice n that time there were good amounts of pineapple choped and served. But later on they served it without pineapples and later on they even reduced there amount also. But in terms of ambience its good.
4.0,Food is good. The ambiance is bit different from regular ones. The staff is good they serve good paratha. One can sit back and senior the time.
3.5,A normal place with normal food.. the price is decent and food taste ok type... If ur forced to visit dis place try dal makhani which tasted great
4.5,"Ordered online many times and Always Excellent food. If you like dhaba food, this is the place to order from. Have not been to the place, so cannot tell about the ambience and service."
4.0,"We have been there for a team dinner on a weekday night. Food was awesome, both veg and NonVeg and specially starters. The best part is service.. Staffs are very friendly and co-operative. A different themed ambience to make up the mood for an evening hangout. The only disappointment is there's corporate discount for a min of 10 members, which we weren't told at the time of Billing. So, be careful on this when you dine at this place.  Must Try : Veg platters, paneer lababdar, Chicken Tandoori, Masala kulcha"
3.0,"Had a causal lunch today at this place. Easy to locate. The ambiance of this place is calming. Very nature friendly. Nothing very fancy.  Very less options for soup. But we order the ""ShorbPalak"", which is green and good. Starter were good. Main course was the ""ok ok"" part. We ordered one with baby corn and other with panner. The baby corn was good but the panner gravy was not good. Roties were usual. Laasi atlast was fulfilling and very good.  Please are complaining about rush, but when we went the place was free and were were served promptly."
2.0,"Pathetic service!! Waited for an hour, still waiting. Nothing was served. On complaining about the same to the staff, they just smiled and ran away.  Giving 2 stars as onions were tasty!! Huh!!"
1.0,Food not good............................ disappointed..................................................................................................................
3.5,"We decided to go to this place for a dinner on Saturday evening... Liked the ambiance, service was also very good and waiters checking for the stuff on table and we didn't have to ask every time for water and tissue papers. .. As far as food is concerned, we liked the starters and the main course, the only thing is soup could have been there along with few more options. Even the price is good here and I can categories it in a pocket-friendly place.  Ambiance - 3.5/5 Service - 4/5 Music - 3/5 Food - 3.5/5  Overall - 3.5/5"
2.0,The service is really slow and poor. The waiter couldn't even remember what we had ordered. The main course arrived before the starters. Nothing great for an ambiance.
4.0,"Place is good, food is delicious and quantity served is perfect. We ordered shahi butter chicken and pudina paratha which were good as expected."
4.0,"Cozy place with a good, homely and desi ambience. The seating is very comfortable and they've recently redone the decor so looks great. Has a separate breakfast menu where you can get unlimited chai and regular north Indian breakfast snacks. Food isn't extraordinarily good but is above average. Will go again just for the ambience. Did I mention they do movie screenings on Thursdays?"
3.0,"Been there for an office lunch. Everything is average except the service, which was a bit perked up maybe because of the upcoming new years. Nothing is bad in particular but nothing remarkable as well"
4.5,One of the best places to have north indian food in HSR layout.We ordered paneer butter masala with lachchha parantha and rajma along with rumali roti. We also ordered dal which was properly prepared. Food was good and quantity was also proper. The ambience was great. Enjoyed the delicacy with my husband Tushar Dwivedi
4.0,Portion size quite small
5.0,Recently I visited here..and I can say that I had best 3 course meal there..ambience is very good.. every Thursday they play some old movie on big screen..the best thing is mitti wali surahi and khat.. book your table in advance if planning in weekend
3.5,I would give extra points for the ambience ... Food is decent and good place to have weekend out.Advice to management pls provide little bit of training to employees.
4.5,"Edit 1: Wanna eat good north Indian food around HSR, this name should definitely be in the consideration list. There are a few things which can be ordered without a second thought coming to your mind, Achari Matki Sabzi, Paneer Lababdar, Garlic Naan and Pineapple Raita.  Theme is cool, staff is courteous, ambience is decent, price is pocket friendly. Thing which might disappoint people sometimes is the waiting because of the rush this place witnesses on weekends and eves."
1.0,Pathetic food and customer service. Regret visiting here. Running a restaurant they cant even provide finger bowl. Non veg starters are too bad.
2.5,The ambiance was supposed to be nice. But it rained when I went and it was a disaster.  The butter chicken was horrible. Just plain disgusting. Tasted nothing like butter chicken. Tasted like this ready to heat meals. The starters were excellent. And the naans and the rotis were just about average.  But not very hygienic and were made to wait for more than 45 minutes between each item they brought. The rotis had gone cold by the time they brought the gravy. That's just bad service.
4.5,"Have been here thrice in the last two months and the only reason is Food, Food and Food. Have ordered all kind of food and pleasantly theyve surprised us all the time. Some delicacies which we were taken away with: - Chicken Pudina  - Chicken tandoori - Chicken Rara - Roomali mushroom Cigar - Non-veg Shorba - Paneer tikka  The only flip side to this place is a long wait and slightly longer service speed while dining."
3.5,"Wanted to give a rating 4, but highly disappointed with the service. Had to wait for 40 min for the main course to arrive after completing the starter. Best part was the food quality, quantity and value for money. All checkboxes ticked. Food was awesome. We tried Non-Veg Soup, chicken Clay Oven Wings and Chicken Taka Tak with some roti and naan. We loved the food. A typical North Indian taste. Will surely make a visit once again and hope to see some improvements with respect to service."
2.0,Weekend nights are crazy here...... obviously food is very good....but long long queue......fed up...after a waiting of 40min and again after placing order again it took another 30 min....
3.5,Ambience is good if u dont mind a dabba kind of seating else comfort level would be marked as low.  Lots of food options.  Taste is good.  But the server messed up with our order and we had a bad time waiting for re orders.
5.0,Gud env and nice customer service....awesome Punjabi style food...  Must visit places in hsr layout....   Value for money....limited menu list ....they need to add few more variety of soups in their list...
3.0,"Place is nice with good ambiance, but the food is not that tasty, bit oily and they serve main course along with the starters. There are better places in HSR that serve great food"
3.5,"Ambiance 4/5 This place is set up like a dhabba. Simple arrangements with lots of decorations. Good hang out spot with family/friends. Seating arrangement for group of 6 can be accommodated.  Starters 3/5 We ordered dhaniya tomato shorba and veg tandoori platter. The soup had tomato flavour only and the spices were very mild. Veg platter had 12 pieces and was decent enough for 3 to 4 people.  Main course 3.5/5 Dhal Makhani was good. The other side dish was more oily, but tasted ok. Cheese paranthas were really good and I personally liked it. Phulkas were soft and served hot..  All the rotis and paranthas were not burnt and I would really appreciate it.  Overall this is a nice place to have north indian food. During weekends there is lots of waiting period, so better to book in advance. Dont think valet parking is available but we can find parking space nearby."
5.0,the fooooodd is yummyy ! Haven't had this tasty paneer lababdar in my life.. the ambience is soo beautifull .. a very nice place. service is good.  Only one thing i didnt like was tomato soup which was more watery . rest the food was mouth-watering.
4.0,"If you're on an empty stomach looking for good food on a budget, then head to this restaurant for some lipsmacking North Indian food with the seating arrangement like that of a Dhaba. Absolutely loved their Chicken Seekh kebab and their Malvani Chicken curry as they were packed with flavours and had the right amount of spice. Their signature Dum Biryani is like a treat to the palate. For dessert, we ordered the sizzling gajar ka halwa with ice cream and that was just beyond delicious. Really polite staff and quick service. Must visit if you're around HSR on a budget."
3.5,"This restaurant was recommended by one of my relatives when we (Myself and my partner) were at HSR, to pay him a visit and were eager to try out the very same day for dinner.  Luckily, the waiting time was minimal as we were quite early. The moment we stepped in, what I liked the most is the Ambience. It positively gives a dhaba feeling as the arrangement is much like any traditional dhaba. I have been to such places before where you tend to get an dhaba atmosphere. Though the seating might not be comfortable but with such theme you shouldnt even expect as you are here for the amazing food (that I heard of) with affordable rates.   Coming to the food section  We ordered veg and non-veg dishes. Me being a non-vegetarian went for Amritasri Fish (Fish was perfectly cooked and blended with spices) and Adraki Dhaniya Murgh (the gravy was amazing). What left me disappointed was the Garlic Naan (more of sesame seeds rather than garlic), which spoiled the taste and was not compatible dish for the curries that we ordered.  Rest, I can say, overall it was a great experience."
4.5,They have a beautiful atmosphere. So if u enjoy eating food with a good atmosphere and if you love listening to old songs along with your dining do visit this place.
5.0,Lovely place. Always loved coming here and taking a break from busy hours of work. Very serene ambience with old hindi music playing in the background. Also food is a 10/10. Must visit!
4.5,"The poor service of staff is annoying...specially the lady staff.....but if u can just ignore this, then ur dine here will be great. The ambiance here is great....food is good and the non vegetarians out there u can have loads of fun eating the mouth watering starters and the biryani .  Vegetarian do have various option. The ambiance here is just amazing....a chowki style of eating and candel light dinner for two and also a live music in the night made my night amazing at silbatti."
4.0,"This place situated in HSR layout has quite a setting for the dhaba style lovers!! Innovative sitting arrangements,umbrella roof , n ya they even have love birds as part of their decor, The chicken starters here though of really good flavor , i felt all of them tasted the same but just looked a little different. we then moved on to the main course which consisted of Indian Breads such as pulkas,romali roti n various other stuffed kulchas n all of these tasted pretty good,though i dont exactly remember their names, the chicken curries were pretty great as well. Ending with a scoop of chocolate ice cream was not a good decision by me bcz i dint like the flavor of the chocolate as it felt too strong. Overall a great place to hangout with your friends n ya the best part is this place is completely pocket friendly!!!!"
4.0,Went here with my friends for lunch.It has to be said that the place offers a different kind of ambience and is peaceful.The food v had included both veg and non veg.It was really good and non-veg in particular was delicious.The best thing abt this place s d service.A very good place to hang out with friends and family.
3.5,The ambience will give a you feel of village dhaba. We ordered North Indian and it turned out to to be good. Service is also upto the mark. If you are going on weekends make sure you have ample of time as there might be long waiting.  Food 4/5 Ambience 3.5/5 Service 3.5/5
4.0,"Been here quite a few times now..esp for the food.Seating arrangement not quite comfortable..both sides...its just inadequate and you wont be at ease at all while eating...not very well thought.Ambience is good.Food to mention has to be aloo tuk,hariyali and the reshmi kebab and lal maans gosht.The raw mango mojito is seasonal i suppose but a must try."
1.0,"Place: cozy Food: unable to rate Crew/staff: severly poor attitude  My friends and I went here last saturday (Nov 18) for a late lunch. When we arrived, the place was packed so we were asked to wait. After about 15 minutes, one of the crew led us to our table. Seated and was about to order, another crew came to us and ask us to vacate the table because he said that it his customer's table. Feeling hungry and all, we dont feel like arguing and just decided to leave and dine somewhere else."
5.0,Very good place. Nice ambience with old songs takes you back in time. Must visit on Thurdays as it is a movie night on that day with a warm bonfire :)
4.0,All the dishes we got were lipsmacking!  Especially the mushroom filled starter was too good ! Decor was impressive too. Rates are not so high. Very moderate rates.  What's the turn down? ... Slow service and long waiting to get a table on a Sunday Evening.
4.0,"Zomato order and it turned out to be a bliss! Initially i wasn't unsure over my choice but the food proved me wrong.  Silbatti's food is good and tasty!! Good and tasty. We ordered Chicken and Mutton Biryani, Paneer gravy and Mutton starters and all very good in taste. Well prepared and well served.  Food is moderate spicy and rich in taste particularly the Dal tadka was the best. The rotis and naan were also yum. For me thumbs up for Silbatti.!  Food- 4/5 Service and Packing- 4/5 Cost-3/5"
1.0,"I went to Silbatti in hope to have some good North Indian style food. We ordered a soup, fish fry, veg Gouloti Kebabs, Gobhi Roghanjosh and 2+2 Roti.   1. Soup - Anyone can make tomato soup, so no different taste. 2. Fish tava fry - The captain suggested to go for fish fry. Fish fry was re-fried to make it hot and this made it very oily without taste. It was tasting like Bhajji. 3. Veg Gouloti Kebabs - We ordered the starters at once and believe me, it took them 40 mins with 2 reminders for Gouloti Kebabs. when the dish arrived it was uncooked, unseasoned and bland.  Main Course - After having bad experience with Starters, we thought to order veg dishes for main course. so we ordered Gobhi Roghanjosh and 2+2 Rotis [what can go wrong with veg dishes?] but again they proved us wrong.  1. Gobhi Roghanjosh - Gobhi not completely cooked, just normal gravy. I personally didn't like the taste as I have tastes Roghanjosh dishes. 2 Roti - For God's sake, can you really mess up order for Roti?? Yes, they didn't disappointed us with Roti also. We were served 2 Rotis with Gobhi Roghanjosh. After that no body came to check on us or to serve 2 more rotis that we ordered. We called the captain asked him for Rotis, he really went in so hurry I thought he will come back with Rotis. He asked someone else and rest is history.  The restaurant manager was also not doing his job. There were only 50 guests and 12 people were not able to serve them. I guess they opened the restaurant because they have to munch money and they don't care about food or customer service. A 'Never ever TRY' from my side to Silbatti"
4.5,The ambience was very nice and properly themed. The service was also quick. The food was also very delicious. Overall a very good experience...
3.5,"The name strikes the right chord if youre a North Indian! Thumbs up for the name, the khat-bench set up, the cushions and sofa set up, the 60-70s Bollywood music! We loved the ambience of the place.. my local friends say that this is one of the finest North Indian food serving places in Bangalore. Service was good, foods not so expensive, they have weekly movie show times for all, some lip-smacking pickle, raw spices at the entrance for buy. Theyve tried there every bit to create a Pind cum Panchayat affair! Talking about the food- one point of critique would be the breads.. lacked texture, softness, Rotis (we ordered 3 kinds- roomali, tawa and garlic naan)- none cooked to perfection and all chewy! The starter spring rolls were delicious, the Palak shorba was comforting, Veg Handi was usual good. I look forward to tasting some real sil batti chutneys here!"
5.0,Nice place to visit. Superb ambience. I loved it. U have to try cashew pulaou it's yummmmmmm.... Lovely place .i wanted to visit again wen I cme to Bangalore.....

4.5,"Good food, ambience, staff.  Had a delicious time.  Cots, earthern flasks for water, nice seating arrangement.  Had veg dishes like variety of Rotisserie, Bhindi masala n Kofta."
4.5,One of its kind of restaurant. Love the ambience and food. The old classic Bollywood movies played there makes you feel good. Pretty good non veg served..
3.0,"One of those places you visit when your colleague recommends it for you.The ambience was really attractive and the good old Hindi music they play makes you sit there for hours. You get typical village dhaba feels. Ambience:4.5 Coming to food, it was okayish. Nothing great about starters: Dahi Kabab and something almond aloo which didn't really have any taste. Kulcha and panner curry was decent. On seeing recommendation in Zomato, we ordered Samosa aloo paratha which was terrible. Hardly there was any aloo. Next, Jeera Rice and dal can never go bad anywhere. Ordered sizzling carrot halwa with ice-cream, which was tasty but overrated. Food: 3.0.No complaints about the service."
4.5,Nice place silbati.i Love to come again..tasty food.. satisfaction food.worth it...i Love to come again Nd again.luv it....lovely decor.nice place to enjoy weekend
2.5,Waiters were getting confused..... Ordered one but got another.... Waiting time is also more. Food is also not that much good. For the late order they gave a complimentary jaljeera..which was full of pudina
3.0,"After reading the decent reviews, we thought of giving the place a try as we like dhaba kinda foods. But we were very disappointed. We ordered 2 starters, 1 maincource curry, 1 kulcha and 1 pudina parantha and the verdict is not very good I am afraid. 1. Til dil murgh - it was only thing that i liked. Chicken was perfectly cooked and all the pieces were very succulent. 2. Ajwani fish - Preparation was good but fish itself was not of good quality, and believe when i say that about fish. Bcoz I live for fish and I have never thought that fish starters can be bad ever. 3. Laal maans - mutton gravy - the worst ever.. the mutton was not at all cooked, it was so hard that we couldn't eat it. The gravy was salty and ruined the taste. 4. Pudina parantha, cheese kulcha - nothing to say much. Both was ok.  Overall: Food - not at all good, slightly overpriced  Ambience n decor - very good, look and fill was of typical dhaba complete with jute beds and all.  Service - slow, provided that it was not at all full. Had to ask twice to serve, they just came and kept the plate on the table."
4.5,"Great Food!!! Gobi Paratha is awesome. Also, Sexy Sunrise Juice... Centre table is romantic... Beautiful Ambience at Night... One of my favourite places..."
5.0,We had been here multiple times and food is awesome every time. They ensure a good service and take good care of kids. My son requested for non spicy food and manager ensure that it is as per his request and even come to check with him post the food is served.
5.0,Silbatti  has  amazing  north  indian food. The ambiance  is a good and the music is also  young and  fun. It has a spot with no roof and a lil  fire which is really  good!

4.0,"The food is really nice and the ambience is good,and we went out with the class,Veg biryani and rouhafzza is really good,place must to visit!!"
4.5,Nice place to have food with family and friends . It has good food and good atmosphere with the Punjabi dhaba feel with lots of North Indian delicacies
4.0,"The food is yummy.best place to eat chicken.been here with whole class,had a get tym.pricing is also resonable.A must and should place to visit.totally loved it"

4.5,The ambience is really flawless.Its a nice place to enjoy with friends or family.The food is really tasty.Enjoyed a lottttt.Such a nice place
5.0,Great food with the ambience of an Indian dhaba. Good hospitality and served with a smile. Chicken tandoori was mouth watering. Must try Punjabi style sweets
4.0,"Awesome food, great ambience with good old Bollywood songs in the background. But staff needs to be more efficient (we didn't get water, beverages came in towards the end of meal).  Must try dish: Chicken kababs"
3.5,The plave has a very dhaba like feel with tge interiors. Staff is very friendly. Food id reasonable and decent to try. mojito is good to taste and food is too
3.5,"Ordered in food from this place about a month back - Andhra style chicken, plain rice, and mustard fish.  Delivery time was reasonable. Packaging was decent.  Chicken was tender and flavorful. But a little oily.  Plain rice amount was generous.  Mustard fish tasted good but the gravy wasn't that great. The mustard was somewhat bitter in taste. I usually love mustard fish gravy. But this was an exception. Plus, the fish quantity was less.  Please improve your gravy. That's a very important factor for consumers."
2.5,Location - It is one of the good location where you don't have to worry about parking. Rating - 4  Ambience - Inside it is okay. Could have been better organized. If it rains then may not be able to sit. Rating - 3  Food (Non-veg) - Very few cuisines are good over here. Not all starters is good. Biriyani was not as expected. If you are a real food lover you won't appreciate the taste of the food. Rating - 2.5  Service - The service is very quick though it was a Sunday evening with more people. Rating - 4  Overall - I will go ahead with a rating of 2.25 as the food didn't appeal that great. It is a one time visit restaurant as there are so many other options available with respect to location and taste for food.
1.0,Did not like the food at all...no taste.did not expect such food at all.many people recommended this place to eat but was not par at all.disappointed.
4.5,Ambience was quite good. Love the seating style and the way water was served was orthodox (in a good way). Service was also good. And if you are a North Indian and seeking for good north indian food then this is the place. Loved it all over!!
4.0,Best place well located for foodieezzz.........taste if good an best place to hangout in that area.....service is the best and ......worth for money
3.5,"Had kalmi chicken legs, which very quite tasty. Place was great, with an open veranda in between and the traditional seating space. The staff couldve been better if they hadnt kept nudging us again and again regarding ordering more food."
4.0,"Open air restaurant... With waiters and waitresses dressed to match the theme....they had a projector but not sure why they were palying a dubbed chinese movie.... Silbatti with seating seemed nice but v chose to take regilar seats....   Now to food.... Food was decent... N liked the paneer labardar.... Desert Bhand Gulab Jamun, jamun on fire looked so attractive.. But sweet taste with alcohol was not a great combination....."
3.5,Had visited on occasion of Halloween..nice ambience.. open space.  Candle light..very quick service.Limited options for soups and starters..  but whatever was available in the menu was good except tomato soup.. Very quick service and courteous staff .. we had ordered cheese onion paratha which could have been improved in taste. Will visit again to try some more options
1.0,"Not a great experience! After waiting for the usual 15minutes, we were offered seat at the charpai. After only 2 mins, we started observing cockroaches crawling over the charpai and the table where we were seated.  We reported the same to the waiter and they changed our seats.  After settling down at the new table, we ordered panner tikka masala, Naan, tandoori roti, masala papad and fresh lime soda.  Food service took quite a while. Finally when the food arrived, panner tasted stale and they forgot serving masala papad."
3.0,"The complimentary gajar halwa was missing. Ordered yesterday night, and order amount Rs 1930. It was a COD and delivery person didnt have change for 2000 note. Dal makhani this time wasnt upto mark, compared to earlier times. Is it due to Friday evening rush?"
2.0,Ordered chicken biryani costing a total of Rs. 250 for home delivery. Received 2 small containers of rice enough for just one person. Too little quantity for such a price. Disappointed.
4.5,"We visited this place yesterday for dinner with Family and Friends. I always used to pass by 19th main but used to think this as any other restaurants. We were surprised to see the Dhaba like ambience. At the center its open to sky sitting with Dhaba like khatiya. They have a big LED screen playing cricket and music. Covered sitting is traditional indian style which i liked most. You can sit on elevated platform and have food in relaxed manner.  Food was good in taste, rates are very reasonable. Must try."
4.0,"Awesome experience as a first timer. The set up was of typical desi dhaba. And the USP was the charpai or khatiya, but we preferred the low sitting baitak. The overall staff was very curtious and the service very express. Coming to food it was worth every single rupee. Well served and great taste, very authentic Punjabi taste. I loved it, and highly recommend. Cheers."
3.0,Visited the place as the name caught my attebtion. Tried vegetarian food but was disappointed with the taste. Ambience is good and tidy. Need to improve on food and service.
3.0,"Went with very high expectations, but was rather disappointed with the overall experience. If this rating was for taste only they'd get a 4- but there were too many misses on hygiene. Agreed that it was a rainy afternoon, but I spent 60% of my time swatting away flies. One fell in my thepla, and I had to throw it away   The staff were all wearing dirty and messy uniforms, and were most disinterested in quality - we got chipped bowls, stale onion, and a dirty table  On the food side - we had nice tandoori chicken , and average butter chicken  All the breads were nice and fresh I don't think I'm going back"
1.5,"Very bad food, was very hungry from all day and ordered a lot of food. When food came it was not what we expected Pindi chole was full of aamchur not able to taste anything else.the roti was burnt and some were uncooked.dont come here."
3.5,"Silbatti gives you a typical dhaba style ambience and seating arrangements. Have tried a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes at Silbatti. The food was for sure not the best, but was not disappointing.   Overall, a good place for ambiance, good north indian style food and is perfect for group dining.  My rating is as follows: Food: 3.5/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Value for Money: 3.5/5  Tip: Improve more on the drinks part!"
1.0,"I ordered dinner from here. Not only was the order delivered hour and a half late, few items were also missing. Pathetic service. Complete waste of money."
1.0,"Food was just pathetic, never order your food from this place you will be highly disappointed... horrible experience. ....wasted money.. we ordered mutton biryani, blunt taste and mutton pieces were uncooked."
2.5,Not great. Uncomfortable. Food is not great and sort of tasteless. Not worth a visit. Food is average. Service is slow.  Although the ambiebce is good the food lacks taste.
1.0,Food is fine but very bad service. Waiters seemed so careless and had to wait a long time for the food. They didn't have power backup. Ended up having a surprise candle lit dinner.
4.5,Typical Dhaba style ambience and seating arrangements. Food is delicious but they should provide more quantity for the price they charge for food...
1.0,This is silbatti special paneer lababdar. Sucks in taste and colour. Poor preparation. Where on earth you have eaten a spicy paneer labadar which has a maroon gravy with an overdose of oil. They have reduce their standards.
3.5,"Being a North Indian, miss eating at dhabas. Searched this place on Zomato so visited on weekend  lunch. We had to wait for 10-15 mins. And the food was worth the wait. We ordered paneer, Daal, lassi, and roti. Everything was tasty and fairly priced. Lot of options for veg. Dishes."
3.5,"The place is really good to visit from the ambience's perspective. There are different huts and wooden sofas. The food is decent enough to try. We ordered kofta curry, tandoori chicken and chicken biriyani. The kofta curry was not at all good. But the chicken biriyani and tandoori chicken were decent enough to try."
3.5,Ambiance - 4.5/5 Place is set up to make it feel like you're really in a village.   Staff is polite and service is good.   Food is very average. Place can definitely work on making the food as memorable as the decor.
4.0,"I visited this place when it was too new.(next day of opening) ..There were many chicken items but lacked in sea food o others. Environment is very good...simple...With lights decors and open space(similar to highway dhaba) Price is reasonable. Tried :a differnt story,  steamed rice, til dil murg,laal maans, butter chicken."
4.0,"Decent tasting food with friendly people working there.  Have tried a variety of veg and non veg both, never really disappointed with their food. But for sure not the best still u can have food packed with flavours."
1.0,"Very poor service for a new restaurant. Unhygienic staff, poor customer service. Was hoping if food can change my mind but huge disappointment"
4.5,"Good food and decently priced too...definitely would like to visit again. We ordered Clay Oven Wings as starters and Lal Maas, Gobi Mussalam and Butter chicken with assorted Rotis.  The service was prompt and the team was very efficient. Overall a good experience."
5.0,Authentic North Indian Food with Great taste. Genuine price and good service. Variety of foods is available and all are really tasty. Perfect Ambience for Chilled out dinner. Friends as well as family can have great time in open air restaurant. Good one.Must visit place if u have love for Good food. Recommended
4.0,"This a nice restaurant in HSR. The service can be improved, the food quality is quite good and the portions are decent too. Gives the vibes of a Punjabi style dhaba. Will visit again for sure. Cheers"
2.0,Order the food today and you will get confirmation tomorrow and the delivery will be done the day after. Pathetic service. Taste of the food is okay. 1.5 hours they took for 2 phulkas and 1 sabzi.
4.5,The small quaint place located in sector 4 HSR layout . The first thing that hits you the most when u enter is everything  is very grounded( literally as the seats are way low and you might have to fold your legs to sit on the seat ). We ordered a starter a side drink along with rumali roti and plain naan.. the chicken dishes that were given were just finger licking good. The menu is plain simple and easy to understand. Altogether a place worth visiting and would love to visit again. Just to keep informed that the prices are super affordable and are justified.
5.0,It's really amazing to be there. Staff behavior is super. Food they serve is really good. I have been there twice..and they never disappointed me. Keep it up...
3.5,"Was here with family. The food was decent. We ordered for malai tikka, tikki, biriyani, kheema mutter and some other stuff that I don't remember. Biriyani was the best out of the lot. Butter milk needs to be improved. Seating is a little uncomfortable as we got one of those tables which were low to the ground and fixed. Otherwise it was a good experience."
1.5,"The most sil*atti restaurant I have ever been to. I could not appreciate the food because the service is crass!!  I have been here twice. The first time nobody really came to serve and had to shout to call. Half the things were unavailable.   The second time for breakfast, the food came very late and was cold. We opted for unlimited juice but really because of their service this was not served on time and we really did not enjoy the place.  Never visiting here again. Bad trip."
1.0,"Felt so hungry n by attractive name - silbatti n its theme ordered food- 1. Pudina paratha- worse taste n tasteless 2. Murgh rara- non spicy no tempting color n full of only garlic flavor 3. Butter roti- again a big no for anybody ordering food 4. Butter rumaly roti- all we ate with our home made pickle 5. Masala kulcha- foul smell n very bad. As if the masala (filling) very old.  Very important- name any other eatery that doesn't send raita for paratha.  Very very important- no onion or chutney with this much order. ""Ab pyaz kya full menu order karney par hi milta""  Such a waste of money, time & interest"
4.5,"Delectable food, fondly prepared and promptly served. The staff is very humble. Would love to visit again.  The ambience is nice and the best part is the movie night!"
3.5,"After moving to beautiful HSR, Silbatti was the first restaurant I tried out. Pity it was during a hurried errand run.  Set in the 19th Main 4th Sector of HSR, Silbatti from outside doesn't impress one, but once you walk in, the abundance of tables, night lighting and village setting is a much welcoming sight. Only a few tables were occupied when we walked in but by the end of our dinner, it was too crowded and we were surprised to see the queue. We knew then this place is lit.  As we were in a hurry and was just there to satisfy the hunger rather than foodie fun run, we asked for a Peas&Mint Pulao, Kaju Pulao and Masaledaar Gobhi Roghanjosh. it took some time for the items to be served, as seemed to be the case with other tables as well. However the Gobhi Roghanjosh was a splendid dish to make up for it. The tangy taste was simply well balanced and I think it would have gone much better with Rotis. The Pulaos were good but not great, although they are in good quantity that we both couldn't finish and took home. We also tried a 'Ginger just got spiked' lime drink and it was also good.  Also saw that they screen movies on Thursday nights and it seems like a good addition to the ambiance.   Overall, a good place for good ambiance and good North Indian food, that wont dig deep into your wallet. Perfect for group dining."
4.0,"High marks for ambience,  relaxed and chilled out place to spend long hours. Food is OK,  could be improved to become a great place in hsr.. Have heard good review about the breakfast still have to try it...."
1.0,"The restaurant stinks and is full of mosquitoes. Instead of eating in peace, we were just busy swatting mosquitoes and getting worried about getting dengue or malaria."
5.0,"Ambience - Very Good Food - Excellent Service - Bindass Drawback - No Eggs My usual lunch place, listing down my favourite dishes/drinks Ghee Roasted Chicken, Dal Tadka, Chicken Briyani, Sexy Sunrise, Orange Cooler, Aloo Tuk, Ghee Rice, Karnataka SPL Chilly Chicken"
1.0,Don't dare to go to this restaurant. Worst experience. Service is very poor. We went there at 8:30 n they serve food at 10:45 and they gave some bullshit excuses like weekend more crowded. Tomato soup is like hot tomato sauce. No taste in prawn. Chicken platter quantity was very less. You have to struggle for water as well. Lot of mosquitoes.  Go to some other place but don't go there. Horrible experience.
1.0,"One word to describe this restaurant - RUBBISH. We ordered simple chicken tandoori tonite for some family celebration via Zomato. Firstly, the order was delivered almost half-an-hour later than the scheduled delivery time & on top of that, with the container seals opened, which was notified to Zomato promptly. Secondly, the food was stale & stinking. So much, that we had to discard almost everything. Therefore guys, watch out before you decide to dine here or order anything. Zomato assured that someone from the resturant will call up but as expected, none called up to discuss the issue. I requested Zomato to honor this issue & arrange for refunding the payment which hasn't been addressed either."
4.0,North Indian place for Dhaba type outside sitting. Food is great and service too. Their Aampanna is a must try.   Food: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Value for Money: 4/5
1.5,Went here since it is very close to where I stay.The ambience was regular.I was really not very impressed by it.The tables were smelling bad because of the cloth they used to clean the table.You might want to apply mosquito repellent before going here since otherwise you will die of Mosquito bites.Little cockroaches keep running on the chairs as well. We ordered chicken til mil which was not very good.Very blant flavours and nothing great.Then we ordered butter chicken and naan.It was just fine.We asked abt Shahi Tukda they said they don't have the same. So basically taking away major points because of the servicing and hygiene issues.
5.0,"Typical North Indian taste, just loved it. It's economical with a good ambience. Has variety of starters and had a soothing experience. Must try"
4.5,Ambiance: It's has a typical village dhaba style sitting arrangements.  Food: Quality and quantity of food is sufficient for two people if they order anyone gravy. Starter is decent. We order lassi so it was little sweet.  The only issue with the place is little congested anyone can see whats there on your table.  Advance booking is recommended.
4.0,The name itself aptly resonates the ambience and food. A decent place to hang out with friends n family. A commendable trial of desi ambience. Like the service and food both. Staff is polite and hospitable.   Value for money.  The only problem is open air sitting during rains.
5.0,"Exceptional chicken makhanwala! The phulkas are wholewheat and soft, sufficient portions all round for two people. The chicken biriyani is delicious as well.  Budget friendly delicious food delivered hot... I strongly recommend this place when youre craving a wholesome north Indian meal"
4.0,"Food: Very economical, very tasty, and very very pleasing. Their Chicken is a must try, according to my friend. I personally liked the paneer dishes. Their Bhand Gulab Jamun is very different and amusing . It is a must try though. Beverages are over priced but they taste well.  Ambience: Good, but as it is an open seating, they need to take care of the mosquitoes. Service: Prompt and friendly."
2.5,"Went with family on Friday, well it is not a classy place. Ambience is good, open space. Food was no doubt awesome, not so reach that you feel heavy after eating.  Only concern was the service which was bad bad and very bad. If you don't have patience then this place is not for you at all"
2.0,"Not good for vegetarians...ambience is good. Service very slow. Quantity is good per plate. Crowded place. Choice for veg also very low,..............................................................."
4.5,It's just wow place.. With the dhabha feeling in middle of residential area.. And best thing is the menu.. Eg for Panner tikka they have mentioned not to be explained .. Coming to the food yes it's tasty but only some items not all.. But yes worth visiting for ambience...
5.0,"I have eaten at Silbatti twice and had exceptionally awesome food each time. The drinks are a must try too. Love the ambiance, the clay pitchers, the dhaba styles cots. Inspite of being extremely full, I had the Bhand Gulab Jamun which I highly recommend too.   So much food on the menu I would want to try, cant wait to be back here again!"
2.0,"Rating is not for food but for online delivery. Both for zomato and Silbatti. Order online, got confirmation from restaurant but after one hour at the time of expected delivery received a call that all their delivery executives are busy and they wont be able to get my order. Zomato: get a better algo to decide whether the order can be delivered or not. Pathetic Costumer Service. Not ordering fromZomatoagain."
5.0,A great place to visit and have the perfect taste of food with the most melodious songs too specially the chicken wings were really good and yummy too.  would surely do a visit in future too.  cheers......:)
3.0,"Starters were great we ordered veg platter, main course was okay. Give a try to Paida Kadhi.. But seating arrangements were very uncomfortable, we were not able to eat properly while seating. Avoid seating on cot...thees will tell to start there and shift to table but they won't. To mgt. Cot seating is really comfortable check out at Kapoor cafe or bhatinda junction ...how they have arranged it."
5.0,Wah! Mazza aa gaya!!!!!  Is the 1st reaction i could give after taking the 1st bite of the creamy butter chicken and the cheese kulcha..when opened the butterchicken box the smell which hit the nose was divine...  Extremly well cooked! Satisfied to the core  Grreeeaaattt job chefs
1.0,"Have always liked the food there. But had the worst experience with ordering online. They didn't deliver even after an hour and a half and when I called them, they refused to take responsibility and were extremely rude. Utterly disappointed. Never eating there or ordering ever again"
4.5,"Silbatti the new restaurant in town in HSR,Bangalore surprised me with the decor and the yummillicious food.As you step in the manager greets and welcomes you with a smile.Lovely old Bollywood melodies can be heard whilst you enjoy your food.The ambience is completely beautiful due to the village and dhaaba touch it gives from small stones at the center ,brickmade benches,jute bed ,lantern,I mean I just kept looking the way they have decorated the complete restaurant in a decent yet beautiful way.They kept earthen bottles covered with a jute cloth around it which keeps the water cool in a natural way.It was my first time after I returned to Bangalore for few days from Dubai.I wish that the restaurant could have started a few years ago while I stayed in Bangalore for 6yrs.The taste of food was so delicious that I will definitely recommend everyone who is there in Bangalore or visits Bangalore to definitely explore this food outlet.I just loved it from drinking water from earthen bottle to deserts at the end.The starters are finger licking and even the main course along with wide range of beverages.Next time I fly down to India I would surely visit again to explore more of this restaurants delicacies.Silbatti you took my heart by the way you served food. I wish I could have captured more moments from this place.No worries there is always a next time. Thanks , Rajani Mazumder"
3.0,"The place is crowded on weekends. And the service also deteriorates with that. The staff is courteous but the service is very slow. But it is better in weekdays. I like the cheese naan here and the cheesy roomali cigar. The complementary aam panna was good. They have a different kind of setting with charpai(beds) like a dhaba and water in earthen containers. The beds can be uncomfortable to sit and eat with the small table. You can have an experience of dining under the stars which comes under your budget too.  Once they were out of chicken lollipops but they took their sweet time to inform us about it which they replaced with some fried chicken. We ordered mutton in main course, it was OK. I liked the gravy though."
1.0,"We visited this restaurant on saturday around 10.30 pm. The moment we reached there, there was no person at the reception desk to attend for the seating. One of the waiter comes and tells us there is waiting. So we kept standing there for half an hour just to find that 4 people randomly walks in and grabs the table we were alloted without anything. When questioned about the same to that particulaar waiter he was clueless. We felt so humiliated because this is what we get in return of being a regular customer. Yes regular customer bcos we have visited this restaurant many times before also. Once we walk out none from the restaurant even insists or apologises. One of the worst customer service from this so called restaurant. Never would step into that restaurant again and refrain friends and family from doing so. 0 stars from us."
4.0,"Unconventional dhaba like setting and vintage bollywood music become the curtain raiser, soaring up expectations. Galouti kebab as starter becomes an unusual opening for the dining. While roti & subzi become the main drama, pulao & raita become the spicy stunt, khus drink becomes the breezy romance. Climax with the bill makes it a value for money outing. Highly recommended!!!"
3.5,"A restaurant located on the roads of HSR  near the agara bus depot has created a name for itself within the first few months of its opening.  I have visited this place at 2 different occasions and have had certain experiences that were pleasent to my taste buds but irritating to my mind. Here is a reason why I rate this place 3.5   Food: food has a good taste of both India in it. They have tasty starters,  main course and desserts and the money is worth the quality that they offer. I'm not a fan of how there menu is put across and they do not have a lot of vegetarian options 3.5/5  Service: this is the part where it gets very irritating. You get a seat and have to literally scream ""excuse me"" for 10 times for someone to notice u and come to u to jus give the menu and you can imagine how hard it would have been to ask for something.  Post the ordering and screaming to b noticed, when I got the food and asked them to serve the food they say no service ma'am, self service! And I sit and wonder if it is self service why would u take orders and deliver the food to our table?  We would have gone and got it ourselves? You either make it self service or serve your customers right. The staff was so ignorant and disinterested that the fun of enjoying my food was just not enough to make this experience worth it.  Please note that this is my experience both the times I visited this place. 0/5   Pricing: it's decent and worth the taste  The feel : restaurant has a Dhaba feel to it with good interiors and I enjoy the seating the most.  Would I visit again?  Only if I had no other option."
4.0,"Nice food, lovely ambience, descent price. The food takes some time, but the taste is excellent. The waiters can be a bit more proactive to gain that extra pointer."
3.5,"Went for lunch, ambiance is good, serving is bit slow, they don't serve the food on your plate unless you asked. Chicken champ and aloo dum benarasi were awesome. Anda biriyani isn't good and the side dish for that is also bad Lassi is a must try here"
4.0,I happen to be there for a friend's party. Personally I love setup of dis place 5/5 Starters we tried we're paneer Tikka: nice but smoky flavour could have been a but more (my personal preference that is)  Roomali cheesy cigars were a spot on.We dint actually realize how fast that ended.  Aloo-badaami was good with nice quantity of almonds -crisp on outside but soft and not mushy.  Kadhai paneer was a spot on -not much oily with large chunks of fresh paneer .  Latpata gobhi was a nice and unique one too.  Dal fry was ok..  Naan were super soft   Gulab jamun was good soft and fresh Coolant with pomegranate was great too ..  We were 10 if ys and had loads of food but bill was just 3200.... ;)  Overall a great experience and yeah not to forget a very cordial manager who made sure food was fresh and hot and was on his toes for complete evening making sure all his customers go back satisfied but yeah service was bit slow probably for it was houseful yesterday  Taste 4.5/5 Service 4.5/5  Value for money 5/5
5.0,"Probably the best north Indian food I had till now in Bangalore plus the ambience of the place is so good and they have open space also. The staff is courteous and helpful. Everything in the menu is good but my favourites were Samosa aloo parantha and bhand gulab Jamuns (gulab Jamuns soaked in a sugar syrup which is infused with rum, and gives a very nice flavour)."
3.5,The food is okay. Quantity of the food served is good. The ambience and the feel of the place is comforting. Music sucks. One time visit place!!
4.5,"I had here the best tomato shorba though we r pure nonvegeterins. we tried spring rolls type variety , fish , mutton kebab (though they can improve by making it more juicy). Nice place to hangout. Like their casual sitting arrangement."
1.0,"This is the worst food I would have had ever. Even I and others can't think of having such a bad food ever. The oil was very bad that was used, the roll was pre fried and re fried in some old resused oil. Ordered paneer lababdar and aloo gobi that too tasted of things being friend in old stale oil. This is first time after eating I had to come back and puke out everything. A big no to this place I will not go and neither recommend this ever to anyone."
4.0,"Our search for a restaurant with authentic North Indian food took us to this place and it was bang on target:) the ambience was just right, keeping the comfort of modern restaurant but still managing to have the charm of a dhaba.  The staff was awesome and the service was top notch.as soon as you enter the staff make you feel comfortable,educate you about the menu and note your culinary performance  I was here for dinner recently with a few friends on a weekday.  Coming to the food food was in good test Cheese chilly partha,masala papad,subz dum biryani,tava fry fish , chicken champ,gulab jamun..all were so testy ..  Ambience 4/5  Service 4.5/5  Food 4/5"
3.0,"I came here for dinner and we were only two guys. I liked the setup and ambience a lot. Nothing too fancy but nice music and 'desi'feel was there. The place had too many people lined and for some reason was crowded, I didn't have any issue but it's just that sometimes it can be a concern for some people/groups. The food was ok(we had veg food) but we had mix Raita which stood out and was very delicious. It was some time that I had a good Raita. Overall a nice calm place, worth1-2 times to come I felt."
1.0,"2nd visit update: Very poor service and inedible food! After long, I visited this place again after seeing it on Zomato Gold and hearing some hype around it. It turned out to be a nightmare experience. Firstly, we waited for almost half an hour only to get undercooked and stale food which was stinking as well.  We ordered an Awadhi Mutton biryani and Amritsari Fish. The biryani was not at all a biryani but a fried rice with stale yucky and chewy (undercooked) mutton pieces. My goodness, it was too bad. The taste of masala fried rice wasn't too bad though but it's so unethical to sell it by saying Awadhi biryani thinking in Bangalore, people won't figure it out. I know very well what is Awadhi biryani or any type of biryani. My mood was totally spoiled by this and undercooked and stale mutton was a total spoiler.  But then this is not it, the Amritsari Fish was even worse and extremely stale and smelly. I had to immediately call the service manager and returned it just after tasting one bite of it. The manager took it back but no signs of apology or compensatory or corrective action was taken by him. I am extremely disappointed with the food and service.  Silbatti is a typical dhaba-style restaurant with nice decor. They serve a variety of North Indian food, which includes flavourful vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. This place is usually crowded over the weekends and there is a high chance that youll have to wait for a table. A suggestion is to reach the restaurant early or reserve your table.  FOOD, TASTE, AND QUALITY  With some expectations, I ordered Lal Maans (a popular Rajasthani mutton gravy dish) along with Garlic Naan and Plain Roti. It took a while to get the food on table. Lal Maans was not like the authentic Lal Maans that you will get in Rajasthan. Not that it was bad but it lacked the authenticity. I like the original preparation and authenticity so this was the only reason I ordered it and not any other mutton gravy.  However, the gravy was delicious and the mutton pieces were cooked to perfection. It was like any other medium-spiced mutton gravy but if you dont think of it being Lal Maans, then certainly the taste and quality was good and I enjoyed it. Portion size was on a slightly lesser side but you can always try out more items for an enjoyable experience.  Garlic Naan had almost no garlic in it and it was almost a Butter Naan only. I dont have a problem eating Butter Naan but in my opinion, if they added a Garlic tag with Naan, they should serve Garlic Naan. Plain Roti was just like how it should be.  Nevertheless, it was an average experience.  SERVICE AND AMBIENCE  The service was a bit slow initially to get the food on table but considering the fact that it was a weekend and the restaurant was jam-packed, it should be fine. Nevertheless, they improved the service later and got us an extra Garlic Naan and Rotis in no time after ordering.  Ambience was good and I felt like sitting in a desi dhaba somewhere in Rajasthan or Punjab. They have nicely decorated the restaurant and the tableware also matched their dhaba theme well."
3.5,"Good food, suiting ambience with the name. Very approachable locality in HSR. Definitely it make you feel that you are away from city life. Chiken pudina tikka was good and mouth watering, chillers and drinks served were awesome liked masala shikanji and pudina lemon soda. Service could have been bit Improved as we have to ask for spoons and forks several times even though requested from staff many times.  Would recommend if you want to tast indian food in HSR region. I will definitely visit again for good food for sure."
4.0,"One of my favorites. It has got interesting seating arrangements. And as the name suggests...they infuse wholesome taste to your dish. The staff is very courteous, and bring the dish quite quickly. Quantity is on the lower side but every molecule of that gravy is very well cooked. My favorite was the murg lazzatdaar. Slow cooked tandoor chicken in a very sophisticated and tasty gravy. Naan bread is well sized and tasty. The only drawback is the juice price. Atrocious to say the least. 125 bucks for lassi? Seriously?"
4.5,Pretty good food. Only starters are bit expensive but taste wise they are superb. Wait time is nearly 20 mins. It's worth trying at least once.
4.5,"Construction: Good, nothing great. 4/5. Staff courtesy : No shortcoming. 5/5. Food taste : we had ordered a mushroom cheese cigar roll, aloo and dal tadka. The roll was delicious and aloo was good. 4.5/5 Food preparation : Initially, the mushroom cigar roll was brought cold. On pointing this out, it was replaced. 4/5 Food quantity : Good. 5/5 Pricing : Doesn't pinch your pocket. 5/5."
4.0,Good place  Quick service  Must try the mulligatawny soup as well as samosa Alu parrota  The mulligatawny soup - strong ginger flavour and dal I guess - good for throat
4.5,"Food is delicious, very good ambiance. I liked the village theme almost all the dish are delicious. Wait and managers are very helpful in describing each dish with favour and their taste. Overall must go place."
4.0,"This restaurant gives me Dabha vibes. A very well lit place with different variety of seating. We can either sit down on a couch or a diwaan. The ambience of the place is vibrant and reminds you of Punjab ki highway.  They serve both veg and non veg. The place offers a large variety of Indian delicacy. We had ordered for Corn Tikka for starters, the spice level was just perfect and it was a nice start for our lunch. Followed by Paneer curry and Butter Roti's, the curry had a very nice balance of flavours and it was a complete delight to eat it along with Boondhi raita.  The staff also is very welcoming. And they definitely serve food worth the cost. So a must try place when you are in HSR layout.Reeshav Paul"
4.0,"Visited this place for a Saturday night dinner. The setting was having a ""desi vibe"" to it. Retro songs playing in the background added to the ambience. Tried kalmi kabab for the starters and paneer lababdaar for main course. Both dishes were good. Fell in love with their Raw Mango mojito: it's a must try there. For two people the cost came around 750 and odd; which I found was pretty decent. All in all a good experience."
4.5,Raw Mango Mojito is  awesome Must try kalmi kebab nd paneer lababdar. Nice Ambience and food is good. The place is amazing.Service is good nd staff r nice.

3.5,Ambience 3.5/5 Food 3.5/5 Staff 3.5/5 The starters were good.We ordered stuffed mushrooms and it was good.Most of the drinks were not available so we ordered raw mango drink and it was amazing.The main course was average.You will experience a bit of proper Dhaba  kind feeling.
1.0,We visited the place for dinner on a Friday evening after seeing the ratings.   We decided to skip the starters and go for mains directly. We ordered chicken malwani and aloo dum with garlic naan. Food took close to 25 mins to come. All three dishes were practically tasteless. Chicken was not fresh either and was giving an off note. Garlic naan had no hint of garlic in it.   We left the entire food and left the place. Only plus side is ambience
4.5,"I visited this place yesterday for a birthday party. We were a group of 13 people. This place has a decent ambience - something like a dhaba style. Every Thursday they play a movie(Bollywood classics). The non veg starters were very tasty. Ghee roast chicken was great! Coming to the veg starters, mushroom starters were not a good option. Biriyani could have been better. Service was fast and good! They offer a 10% discount for a group of 10 people and above. 20% discount above 15 people. Drinks and desserts were  also good. The place was well decorated and you can click good pictures.Overall, I loved the place! Food was very tasty and yummy!"

3.0,"Given the high number of punjabi dhaba style food outlets that are cropping up all around HSR, Silbatti has to pull its socks up.  The ambience of the place is nice and open air, almost reminded me of a dhaba located on the highway.  We wandered here for a quick bite, so ordered just chicken kadhai, palak paneer and garlic naan. The most wierd part was that we got the naan bread and chicken in like 15 mins of placing the order, but the palak paneer turned all elusive. It took them 45 mins to get us the palak paneer on our table.  The sad part is since they had served us naan and chicken 30 mins before the paneer we had more or less finished our meal when the paneer came. This entire experience made our lunch extremely frustating.  The food was not bad, but again nothing extraordinary either So would i return to this place for the food... maybe but the mixup with our order and unfeeling service has made sure I wont be going back to this place."
4.0,"The perfect dhaba style ambiance what to say about the place it's amazing. It's all about North Indian Cuisine and they are perfect in every dish no need to worry with food you can go blindly and food will amaze you.   Aam Panna   Just a wow.  Orange Mojito  They tried something new in the mocktails and it's came out well.   Appetizers  Aloo Badami Tikki   we usually call it Nut Kebab they done it good but I have already tasted the best version.   Cheesy Roomali Cigar   Something new for me and must try for all vegetarians.

3.5,"We tried this place yesterday evening, seating is good and comfortable with village style decor.  We ordered kadahi paneer - quite OK, my taste but did find that wow feeling :( Malai kofta - it was also average Roti n butter Naan_ garlic- both were good Virgin mojito - was below average & disappointing  Overall average place, not heavy on pocket. Staff is attentive and helpful."
2.5,"When you get a village or dhaba theme ambience and that too in open space then expectations from food increases many folds. That's the problem with Silbatti. With nice ambience, food is a big let down. We ordered Non veg kebab platter for starters. Prawns, chicken seekh, chicken malai tikka were good but fish tikka tasted very bad and even the fish they served tasted stale. Add to that, service is pathetic. Chicken Lazzatdar is the biggest culprit and one must avoid. Only saving grace is the ambience."
4.5,"Visited the place this weekend for dinner. Had to wait for around 15 mints as we didn't have pre-booking. But as weather and location of Restaurant was awesome, time just passed.    Coming to ambience, it has given a look of village type motel, music was good. Even seats are designed are like, so it gives a feel of dhaba.   Food was really tasty. It has a different taste. We ordered seekh kabab, dahi kabab in starters and paneer butter masala in main course. Cheese naan was also yummy. Non-veg items were also good.  In all, food will be given 5 out of 5 stars.   Even pricing is not costly.  Would like to visit again."
4.0,Ambience was good. Staff was caring. Service was fast and good.Food was tasty but not outlandish. Maybe we selected a wrong dish. However worth trying Dining out here in the evenings must be a pleasure.
3.5,"Have been wanting to go here for a long time. Had heard great reviews from a friend. Finally we celebrated Eid here. The ambience is outstanding and with the gentle breeze its amazing.  The food was decent. Starter was dahi k tikki and a tomato both of which were average. For main course we Ordered malwani chicken but it had a weird coconutty taste and we Asked them to change it and they did. We ordered Rahra chicken as a replacement which was pretty good.  Overall the staff is friendly, ambience is pretty good and it's not very expensive."
3.0,The place has a nice rustic charm about it. Brick benches. Charpais. Open air. With a giant screen in the middle that plays regular tv everyday and Bollywood blockbusters on Thursday evenings. The kind of menu is what you can expect in any North Indian restaurant. The kadais and the makhnis. With a few surprises like roomali cheese rolls as starters. The food is rich and predictable. They have a few mocktails which sound good. I had the raw mango mojito. Which was quite cool. But the lassi is extremely disappointing. Right from the glass it's served in. Seems very out of place for a decor like this. And tastes very boring. Go. It's that familiar dine out space with a better ambience thrown in. Very suitable for a family outing.
3.5,Amazing place at a amazing location and the food is also something which attracts the neighborhood. Starter's and beverage are too good but need more spice and taste in non-veg items. Had a mind-blowing time with friends.
3.5,"Food wise and ambiance wise a good place to hangout!!! Service needs a little bit more improvement. Deserts option when I went there was only in menu but not available. Also during day time a fix for flys would be appreciated as there are flys during the day, which feels irritating."
1.5,Food quality is worst. Had just veg food. After eating got gastric issues from night and next day had to take leave from office. Restaurant theme is good but since it's open restaurant had to deal with mosquitoes. No one was caring to serve food all waiters busy watching pak vs SL match.Not good experience
1.0,Had been to this place in HSR last saturday for dinner.This place looks like a dhaba - has open roof and lot of flies\ mosquitoes flying around you. One even fell on my food. We ordered sweet lassi - it had consistency of tomato ketchup. Not tasty also..The waiters were just throwing plates like you are at their mercy. Starters were good. We ordered chicken biryani and here comes the surprise..The chicken piece was pink with blood oozing out..When i complained to the manager..he took my plate to the kitchen and returned back saying it is not under but overcooked and said you can have it...OMG!!! I returned it saying I do not need it..He just took it away and never bothered to ask if i need to order something else..Pathetic experience. I do not recommend this to anyone...
4.5,"Wow, just wow!!! What a place!! One of the best places I have been in recent past around HSR. Food quality, ambience, service every single thing is perfect. It's must visit place.  Ambience : 5/5 Food : 4.5/5 Service : 4/5"
2.5,"Located in H.S.R Layout...it was a Thursday evening when i decided to go for a dinner...and as we were doing a bit of research on which restaurant to dine,we landed here at ''Silbatti'....Meaning(Old Age Stone mortar and Pestle.)I just saw a huge Projector T.V which caught my eye with a little different theme.As we walked in we noticed that the whole set up was made with bamboo and thatched roofs which reminded me of Goa.Like the restaurants full of shacks,...sand and beach.Anyways it was nothing new to me but all i was interested was in their food. So we settled down & opened the menu.....there were many choice for Veg and non-veg eaters.We ordered mostly non-veg coz we all are die hard fans of non-veg.Here's what we ordered for (Starter and Mainncourse) STARTER: TANDOORI CHICKEN(TASTELESS)NO SALT  SIDE DISH: MUTTON ROGANJOSH(OK)NOT THAT GREAT MAINCOURSE:CHICKEN BIRYANI:(WAS JUST FINE) ..................CHICKEN GHEE ROAST:(WAS FULL OF MASALA..DON'T KNOW WHAT I ACTUALLY ATE.....NO GHEE WAS ADDED) NAN KULCHA(TOO DRY) Over all the food was okay....Neither too good nor bad....Pricing was a bit high for the Quality of food served.There was No - Proper Service on the table.They should improve on their Food Quality and Service....You can still give it a try here as food served is atleast Fresh."
1.0,"Team Silbatti, Pls stop posting wrong info regarding the ramzan special delicacies just to attract customers. We walked in today, aspiring to have haleem and the response is that u don't have anything special for this year. Why publish fake news n waste customers' time??????"
1.0,Bad this place is is a misnomer for a hotel. They advertised for Haleem and o walked in. What I had was the worst dish whatever it is. No where near traditional Haleem but something salty and soup like. More of a mutton mine soup with tons of salt. When I asked for Haleem half of the restaurant staff ran around and got me something after 20 mins. The service is very casual and take it or go kind of attitude.
4.0,"It was a Friday evening when a bunch of our friends decided to have some nice time, we spotted out Silbatti for our laid-back dinner. Silbatti is located in HSR layout, a cool joint for friends/family gatherings. The ambience of the restaurant has to be appreciated definitely. Silbatti is an Alfresco restaurant. The fact that you sit on a charpoy or a on a wooden bench with cushions in low seatings , bamboo chairs and tables, clay jugs and glasses , with the wind on your face and a good bunch of people, the food you eat is at minimum fuss. This kind of feeling makes the place and it's food so good and a memorable one.  With that perfect ambience which was much needed, we started off our dinner. We ordered the Aloo Badami Tikki, Til Dil Murgh, Lamb sheekh kebab, Tawa fried fish. The Aloo Badami Tikki was aloo fried nuggets coated with badam flakes was a favourite among the veggies. The Til Dil Murgh was chicken marinated in malai and topped with sesame sprinkle, tandoor cooked, tasted pretty good. Me being a person who craves for sheekh kebabs loved their lamb sheekh kebab. I believe that a perfect sheek kebab in this kind of an ambience does all the magic. I enjoyed the lamb sheekh kebab.  For the main course, we ordered the Rara Murgh, Gosht Rogan Josh, Sarson Machi curry, Aloo Dum Benarasi, Paneer Lababdar and Dal Makhani, We paired it with some Cheese Roti, Trikon Wheat Paratha. All the curries tasted good and it was pretty decent to be paired with the roti's. The veggies loved almost all their curries, The most favourite among the non-veggies were the sarson machi curry and ghost Rogan Josh.  In this kind of an relaxing ambience, who would not like to make it more fun by ordering briyani and lucky us, the briyani was perfect. We all loved it and in-fact we went in ordering for another round. The briyani tasted yumm , soft basmati rice perfectly spiced with well cooked chicken, the flavours were simply out-standing. In most places, the salan doe'snt taste that great, but here it was great, went well with the briyani. I highly recommend briyani here .  In Desserts, we had the Gajar Ka Halwa and Bhand Gulab Jamun. We all loved the Bhand Gulab Jamun. This made sure that we all went high, Rum soaked gulab jamuns and yayyy it was a flambe gulab jamun.   Overall, a decent and a chillax place to have a hearty food which is light on your pockets, An ideal destination for family/friends get togethers. May it be a weekend/weekdays drop in to silbatti and am sure you all will love it, Firstly, the place is inviting, once you enter in, it surely does the work of destressing you all with its perfect chilled out ambience.   Notes: Couples who are looking out for candle-light dinners, dine under the trees and stars and have a great time with your loved ones , Yes they do have candle-light couple tables too. And the best part is it's easy on your pocket.                                             thecrumbstashdeepa.blogspot.com"

4.0,"My office being next to it made me visit this place very often but mostly for take aways. Recently I was invited as a part of Food Bloggers Association Bangalore. I liked it's decor very much. A very rustic North Indian Dhaba Style Restaurant with the cane furnitures, charpai, low cement benches with cusions. Used candle lights for the charpai/Khatiyas giving it the romantic touch. Mostly open air, or shaded by thatched roofs, made it look very old school dhaba, but the the cane furnitures, colourful cusions and laptop charging points gave it the modern touch. A kid friendly place with beautiful Bollywood and Punjabi numbers playing in the background. The place is for all, be it a romantic dinner, a family eat out place or team lunch.  The service at this place is impeccable. The staff is very polite and helpful, though few of them have to be trained about there menu.  Coming to the food, they have some unique dishes to serve and some are very common that you get mostly every dhaba or restaurant. The only difference would be that the taste is very rustic, authentic, perfectly spiced and good marination. They do not serve alcohol.  We were greeted with two wonderful mocktails. Both very different and unique from each other.  Orange Mojito: Perfect refreshing drink. Medley of orange and lemonade with fresh mint leaves perfectly muddled with lemon to bring out those citric flavors.  Aam Panna: What is better as a perfect summer drink as Aam Panna. The tangy taste of raw mango, slightly smoked and grilled and then the pulp is mixed with some Indian spices. The drink was served with a small piece of raw Mango which gave a nice bite every time I was taking a sip.  Appetizers  Aloo Badami Tikki : Spicy potato tikkis coated with bread crumbs and almond flakes. It was a decent starter but nothing out of the box.  Cheesy Roomali Cigar: This was one of the best vegetarian starters. My group just couldn't stop at one. A mixture of cheese and mushrooms with balanced spice, stuffed and rolled in a roomali sheet, deep fried.  Til Dil Mugh: Chicken Malai tikkas perfectly grilled in tandoor with generous sprinkling of sesame seeds. The sweet taste of cashew paste with cream was really blowing me away. The chicken was soft but I think it could use more marination time.  Tava Fried Fish: Basa fish fillet marinated in lemon and pan fried with red dry Chillies, curry leaves giving out the best of southern flavors. The fish was fresh and tasted really nice.  Lamb Sheek Kebab: Minced lamb with the nawabai moghal spices tandoored on a Seekh. Full of flavors, soft and perfectly moist. I'm a mutton person so I'm biased towards it.  Main course  Dal Makhni: This is a quintessential, must order dish whenever I go to any restaurant to have Indian food. It was smooth and creamy, went well with parathas and naans.  Aloo Dum Benarsi : A truly North Indian delicacy. Baby potatoes stuffed with dry fruits cooked in a onion tomato gravy..  Achari Matki Subzi : A spicy version of mixed vegetables, a lil too spicy for my taste but was liked by every vegetarian in our group. A medley of vegetables in a thick gravy which went well with plain wheat parathas.  Paneer Lababdar: Chunky pieces of paneer in a spicy and tangy gravy, made of Tomato paste and curd.  Murgh Rara: This was an interesting dish. It had nothing grounded as well as chunky pieces of chicken. A thick gravy which I enjoyed with cheese naan.  Gosht Rogan Josh: One of the best in the menu, and you could definitely find the notes of Kashmiri Chillies, the Mutton was soft best enjoyed with plain rice or hot rotis. As I'm a Mutton person as mentioned earlier, I was definitely inclined towards this one.  Shorson Macchi: This was the definitely a dish one should go for. The only difference here from the usual Bengali mustard curry is the fish used. It's basa fish. Though good for the people who hate fish bones. The taste was brilliant and surprisingly enjoyed with both rice and rotis.  Steamed Rice: Some steam white basmati rice which was enjoyed with the above mentioned accompaniments.  Murgh Dum Biryani : I liked the Biryani, not over spiced, just correct. Nothing over the top though. Not the best biryani ever, but not bad. It was coupled with salan and raita. Chicken was tender and perfectly cooked.  Assorted Indian Breads: They had quite a different choices for us. They had the usual bread basket with tandoori rotis, butter naan, lachha paratha and garlic naan. The two breads which stood out for me were the triangle shaped wheat plain parathas and the cheese naan. The wheat was simple and was going with all the curries. Dessert: One cannot have enough of desserts. How much full one is, some space is always reserved for the desserts. And me with my usual sweet tooth enjoyed both the desserts served to us.   Sizzling Gajar Halwa: Our very own, favorite of many, Gajar ka halwa served on a hot sizzler plate. I was extremely happy as it is one of favorites and to eat Gajar ka halwa in summer, I must have my lucky stars inclined.. Bhand Gulab Jamun: This dessert was served in style. A perfect twist which was a game changer for our beloved Gulab Jamuns. Flamb Gulab Jamuns to be exact. Dark Rum is poured on top and fire is lighted on it adding a new level of drama to the dessert. A perfect high which was required after a full filling dinner. A strict no no for all the non alcoholics, as it is quite potent.  Had quite a good experience with the restaurant is terms of food and service. Gave few suggestions on the spot which they took sportingly. Enjoyed my evening thoroughly with my friends with some beautiful music in the background.  Definitely a thumbs up for the whole team of silbatti and suggest you guys people out there to definitely try this place.

The projector was on telecasting a cricket match.  Ordered main course directly . Ordered their Masaledaar Gobhi Roganjosh and Achari Matka Sabzi with Phulka , Butter Naan , Garlic Naan , Lacha Paratha.

3.5,"A bit late in writing the review as we visited the place a few months back with friends for dinner. Overall the place is quite good in ambiance, food and service. The place has sort of village look and seating also has rural touch. Being a weekday we got good choice to select a table. We ordered veg food which was very tasty. everything that we ordered was good in taste and quantity though a bit heavy on stomach. Service was prompt and staff was good.  Can visit the place again."
4.5,Had a great food here... ambiance. People plz b careful selecting your bud taste... i am sure u ll enjoy food here if u made a correct choice!
2.5,"The only reason I stepped into this place was it's Ambience. Eventually it turned out to be the only saving grace for me.  For one, the receptionist escorted us to a table with 3 chairs for the 4 of us. One of us waited a good 10 mins for the staff to arrange another one but eventually had to borrow one ourselves from the adjoining table.   Service wasn't great too with the waiter taking his own sweet time to take note of our order and at times not even turning up even after signalling him that we are ready to order. Walks right past us several times.   Food wasn't up to the mark. Gravy was either too bland or too watery. Starters were uninteresting and lacked the spice too. The one thing that I liked was the Lassi there.   Anyway, Ambience though was wonderful. The natural setting like that of a Dhaba makes for a wishful thinking of great food in the end."
1.0,If you are not serious about home delivery then please don't. Really disappointed with the Service. I had ordered sattu paratha and later on told it was not available. The guy had not made any disclosure to inform me that there was a difference in price if they were to replace it with another item. I had to call and ask for giving me refund of extra money charged. Secondly as mentioned all paratha had to be delivered with pickle and curd. This was not provided with the order. As it is there are very few restaurants in HSR because most get closed due to lack of service.i guess this is heading the same way.
5.0,Lovely atmosphere and friendly staff  The food is brilliant and the service is quick and prompt  We had the platter for starters and was very good with a wide variety  The naans and rotis were fresh and soft  The gravies and salad were quite large in portion and we in fact had to parcel a bit of it!   Will be back!
4.0,"A friday night dinner which turned to be a beautiful affair !!!  Silbatti is situated on the 19th main road and has parking on the road.  The place has a very rustic feel to it, with khatiyas and earthenware with kulhad for water.  We ordered aam ka panna, aloo badam ki tikki, cheesy roomali cigars, aloo dum banarsi, dal makhni, paneer labardar, cheesy naan, rotis, sizzling gajar ka halwa and bhand gulab jaamun.  The aam ka panna was delicious and chill. The appetizers tikki and cigars were really good. The cheesy cigars as suggested were goey and cheesy - were really delicious and i would definitely order them again.  The mains consisting of sabzis and rotis were delicious. I am a person who cannot handle spicy food and i must say the food here won me over with flavour and the spice level.  The paneer used in paneer labardar was really fresh and melt in the mouth, which made the dish very tasty.  Now coming to the deserts, if one doesn't have a liking for anything liquor then this gulab jamun is not for them..this piping hot gulab jamun came out with a flame on it ...i personally liked that lil taste of alcohol in gulab jamun and loved the play of a flambe in a cup on the gulab jamun.  Over all the silbatti offers the diners a relaxed atmosphere to have food. The staff here is also very courteous and helpful.  KrantiKrishna (krantiawelltravelledgourmand)"

4.0,"After a rough day at work decided to catch up with my friends at some casual dine in place   Where things would be at peace  we can have some conversations laughter and then charged up for our weekend.  Silbatti  HSR it is!  Reasons its calm and exurban  in one line it has a simplicity and charm that is typical countryside!  Was kinda skeptical before I stepped in but once I was there by around  7.30 pm  I was proved wrong.  The ambiance is to that of typical countryside one  with different type of seating arrangements   For large group  they have the low lying tables with long sofas and colorful cushions.  Then comes for couples just the two seating arrangement with a candle light perfect placed on the table for a cute date that aint again expensive!  Then comes the regular seating for a group of 4 or more!  Last but not the least - do they have the charpai of khatiya style of seating with a wooden plan laid in between that gives it a perfect dhaba feel!  Ambiance  4.5/5  I simply loved it as they had options for every diner! Large groups family or a couple! Perfecto!  And the collection of songs they play from old classics to latest Bollywood numbers are simply the best and infact go well with the ambiance  and would for sure uplift ones mood!  Then in mean while we all choose to have some coolers  aam pana and orange blast.  I personally loved the orange blast as it had the right amount of fizz and fresh oranges added  topped with mint leaves gave it a remarkable taste too!  Then coming to food we ordered some veg and non  veg starters,  Veg starters we choose to eat  Cheesy roomali cigars  quite an odd name but  it was indeed a show stealer among all the starters we had fr the day  Perfectly cooked  a thin roll of roomali roti stuffed with cheese and finely chopped mushrooms cooked with mild spices  boyyyy it was a great mouthwatering one !  Would give a big round of applause the chef on that one for sure!  Badam Aloo tikki  which was the deep fried aloo n veg tikki coated with finely chopped almonds  it tasted good as well.  Lamb sheek kabab  which was pretty decent  finely minced meat cooked to perfection and grilled in tandoor !  But it was a bit dry to my liking  it has to be a bit juicy and soft.  Til dil murgh  It was those boneless chicken chunks marinated in malai  cooked in tandoor  it had the right amount of sesame seeds being used but the chicken was a bit hard  should have been cooked for some more time. Ok dish  Tawa fried fish  It was the basa fish fillets which had the basic spices added like red chili paste lemon and coated with curry leaves  it was indeed soft cooked well and for me its worth trying.  Main course   Murgh Rara  It was a chicken preparation with loads of onions  was just ok.  Ghost rogan josh  a famous mutton delicacy  its a lamb preparation with rich gravy and hint of saffron  but here again the mutton was a bit undercooked  it has be tender!  Sarson machi curry  A Bengali style curry  cooked well with mustard and onions gravy  this one was really good in terms of taste .  Aloo dum Benarasi: it was a tasty curry cooked well with baby potatoes  dry fruits in a thick tomato gravy a must try for vegetarian lovers out there.   Dal makhani: The dal makhani was indeed rich  thick and creamy  and was indeed a good one tasted great.   Paneer lababdar: This paneer curry was great and the paneer they used was indeed fresh and soft. The gravy was a bit sweet but had the right amount of spices used in it .  Achari matki sabzi: It was indeed a perfect dish with loads of vegetables cooked in a thick gravy. The taste was apt.   Cheese naan: was average  nothing to rave about  they cheese stuffing was a bit less and they should have added some basic masalas to make sure it aint that bland.   Rotis / Trikon wheat parathas: We choose to have Trikon wheat parathas which were the plain parathas in shape of triangle and rotis that goes well with curries and there were no complaints.  Murgh dum biryani  I loved their biryani as it was a bit less spicy but had the right tasted topped with fried onions and chicken cooked to perfection.  Coming to my favorite part in a meal  DESSERTS!  Sizzling gajar ka halwa: It was nothing but hot carrot halwa served on a sizzler platter  not sure why they did so -it was just okay and to be honest they could have still done a better job  by grating the carrots and adding up some more nuts. Gota check on this one.  Bhand gulab jamoon: Loved this one  for all those RUM lovers out there  do try this  Those juicy dollops of love - gulab jamoon set on fire by adding up RUM over. It was really Innovative, which I personally loved  but for sure a big NO for non-alcohol persona!  We shared our feedback in terms of those minor hiccups and they received them politely and assured to check up on those stuff,   Service  4/5 - They staff are really polite attentive and humble.  They need to be tweaked up on and trained more up on the stuff they serve  apart from that no other major complaints    VFM- 4/5  keeping in mind their reasonable prices  pretty descent food.  Will come back for sure  for the country side ambiance and will try other Punjabi delicacies they offer.  Keep up the great work team SILBATTI!   In a nut shell it was yet another memorable meet up with friends :) fr dinner !                                             krantiawelltravelledgourmand.wordpress.com"
4.0,"After the hectic day in office on Friday,Staying in HSR need to go some refereshing and relaxing place for dinner in HSR layout. Finally got this place.This resturant caught my attention because of its interior and ambience and its unique name. This place is opend 6 months back,Light & Soft music and apt lighting. Very nice different-different sitting arrangment. A place for candlie night dinner also. And Dhabha like sitting also available and it welcoming folksy ambiance.  Huge Menu with good quantity and quality. Drink : Mango Season, So Pretty delight AAM PANNA...  Food : The starter looked interesting and was delicious. I loved the Started name as Cheesy Roomali Cigars, which was amazing and new in its own way. Cheese Naan and Layered Plain Paratha is reallu nice. Achari matki sabzi curry was tasty and yum with Dal Makhani.  Desert : Sizzling Gajar Halwa and Flaming(Bhand) Gulab Jamun was amazing deserts there. Need to be improve in Starters and Curries. Need to try the New signature dish ""CURD RICE ICE-CREAM"" in my next visit.  Price is reasonable. Service is well with friendly staff. They have multiple food festival according to season. Good place in HSR Layout for dining."
2.0,We ordered once before from Silbatti but the delivery was quite delayed. The food was decent but not great. We decided to give it another shot. This time the order arrived 2 hours late and food quality was pathetic. The food proportions are also quite small for the price. Not ordering from here again.
4.0,"Last Friday some of my friends were meeting up at this place which they frequent . I underestimated the Friday crowd and then spent 1 hour 15 mins waiting for the Ola/ UBER. Literally 'exhaustipated' , I was making up mind to give up when a human angel by the name 'jennifer' gave me lift till this place in her ola auto. My friends had waited for long and done with starters . Fatigue , I decided to give it a pass too & straight dig into main course. Recommended by friends, I started with an aam panna.Then we tried the paneer lababdar, ( I am a self professed paneer fan) , Dal makhani (another veg weakness of mine) , murgh rara (I liked this) , laal mans (mutton curry with various spices and brown onion). We ordered for trikon wheat paratha (just like the home made paratha , we grew up at home with) , naan & cheese naan. This cheese naan was very nice & my recommendation to all who visit here. We also tried the murgh dum biriyani , according to me , after all the good food , this is one thing they probably need to check or work on. According to me it was little dry, again it's a personal choice. We summed up the evening with sizzling gajar halwa & bhand Gulab jamun. Now this is intriguing am sure :-) the Gulab jamun is dunked in sugar syrup and top layer has rum (which they use for flambe n serve). That's how the Gulab jamun gets its name . If you are ordering for 2 desserts go for the other one first and then this bhand Gulab jamun, as its tad sweeter . There is novelty in the desserts. When it comes to the ambience of this place it's 100/100. A wonderful re-creation of dhaba like atmosphere with khatiya/ chsrpoys , similar atmosphere .. as its a mix of open and shaded sitting , it's a perfect respite for city dwellers They also host different kind of food festivals to match the mood , like currently they are running ""beat the heat"" menu. They also have Bollywood numbers playing on Wednesdays , with a red carpet entrance to give the celebrity feeling and popcorn on the house. They host bar-b-q nights during winters . I was intrigued to know that they have something called 'curd rice ice cream ' now this is something so incredible to me , I got to taste in my next visit. They don't serve alcohol, people come here mainly for the food and ambience, which I felt is good, as we have enough watering holes, pubs n restaurants in the city. Sometimes it's good to have such places where you can spend a quiet evening with your dear one or family , accompanied by kids and elders. avrilsfoodjournee.com"
4.0,"I recently visited Silbatti in HSR Layout, along with a group of foodie friends.   The place has a lovely, rustic ambience. I loved the khatiyas and brick walls here, which give it the feel of a highway dhaba! The eatery is open to the air, making for a beautiful dining experience. The old Hindi hit songs playing here take the mood of the diners up by quite a few notches! I also loved the mud water bottles that are placed on every table - such beautiful, naturally cool water!  We had a good time at this place, and I liked most of the food that we tried out. Here's a round-up of all the food and drinks that we sampled at Silbatti:   Orange mojito: Oh, this was absolutely beautiful! It was just perfect, a great medley of orange and lemon flavours. A right thirst quencher this, and very refreshing.   Aam panna: This drink was beautiful, too. It was just the right mix of sweet and spicy and tangy, a treat to the tastebuds.   Aloo badami tikki: These deep-fried potato nuggets came with a generous sprinkling of almond slivers. They tasted decent, but didn't really win me over.   Cheesy roomali cigars: I absolutely loved these! They were so very well done, with a delicious stuffing of mushrooms and a generous amount of cheese wrapped inside a soft 'roomali' shell, and then deep-fried.  Aloo dum Benarasi: This was another delicious preparation - baby potatoes stuffed with a mix of dry fruits and spices, slow cooked in a finger-licking tasty gravy.   Dal makhani: I liked the dal makhani here - well-cooked and mild in taste. It was rich and creamy, without being overwhelming.   Paneer lababdar: This curry was well done too. The gravy was tasty, and the chunks of paneer in it were melt-in-the-mouth soft.   Achari matki sabzi: This was another lovely dish, with a variety of vegetables cooked in a flavourful gravy. The taste was just right for me - neither too spicy, nor too bland.   Cheese naan: I felt this was just average. It didn't really bowl me over.   Rotis: We opted for some rotis to go with the curries, which were quite well done.  Sizzling gajar halwa: This super-hot carrot halwa served on a sizzler platter was just okay, in my humble opinion. It could have been more flavourful.   Bhand gulab jamun: This was nothing but the humble gulab jamun set on fire, with the addition of some alchohol to the syrup. Innovative, yes, but this wasn't my cup of tea. I would take a bowl of plain gulab jamun over something like this, any day!  Overall, we enjoyed the food at Silbatti and the lovely ambience too. It seems to be a great place to savour some Indian food, relaxed and bonding with near and dear ones."
1.0,Wosrt service in food business. Their manager named as Syed and staff were arogant while delivering the orders to the customers.very unprofessional behavior from Mr. Syed as he don't have curtosy to accept his falult instead he is asking customer to leave the food and place if they have any problem. Need lot of improvement in customer service.
4.0,Good food..good ambiance Went with friends...nice and soft music ..exceptional starters..main course wasn't so great but overall experience good. Recommended for dinner as its dhaba kind of setup and you may feel little hot in afternoon but they have spray fans in certain areas of hotel.
2.0,Been to the restaurant with my wife . Ordered chicken lollipop and murgh biryani to see the taste and if it is good we can order further .The lollipop is cold and we told the server to make sure the biryani hot . But biryani also cold . We didn't feel the food is fresh .   But the restaurant ambiance is good .
5.0,One of the best Restaurant in Bangalore...ambiance is good... The taste of the food was really finger licking...yummy spicy .... delicious.....ordered chicken tikka and phulka with gobi mutter....  Chicken tikka was really nice barbeque...taste ...I enjoyed this restaurant.... for sure ... i am planning to again and again to try rest of all the menu items...
4.5,"We chanced upon this restaurant one evening and it was one great find! The first thing you notice about the place is the ambience which is a rustic setting, a good start. Coming to the food, I have had the vegetarian food all the times I've been there. Can't wait to try the non veg dishes though!  We tried their vegetarian kebab platter which had three servings each of roomali cigars- a fried cigar filled with cheese, dahi kabab, aloo Badami kabab and paneer tika. Each of these were delicious tough my favorite would be the roomali cigars. The dahiya kebab and aloo Badami kebab were a tad dry though when we ordered it on the 2nd visit.  In the main course, the phulkas are so soft that they melt in your mouth. The same goes with the paneer. We had the palak paneer and it was perfect! We had also tried the banarasi aloo which I wasn't a huge fan of since it was sweet. The dal tadka again is good!  Coming to the beverages, they have a whole menu full, however they didn't have most of the items on the menu. However I didn't mind since they had Lassi! The Lassi was thick and garnished with tutti fruities, an absolute delight- I can go back anytime for that Lassi! The only suggestion would be to reduce the quantity of tutti fruities since it makes it overtly sweet coz the lassi itself is sweet.  What adds to the entire charm of the place is that the prices are reasonable and the staff is extremely courteous!  With all of these positives, who wouldn't want to keep going back to Silbatti! Did I mention the Lassi? ;)"
3.5,"Good food, Good Ambience and courteous staff. It's more of a family setting. Open air, live screen. The food is served in good quantity and tastes good. The staff is friendly. You can surely visit on a day when you want to just chill with your family and enjoy a nice evening."
5.0,"I am Vegetarian. I really liked the food, especially Veg Subz Dum Biryani, Paneer Tikka Masala & Paneer Lababdar. The Best part is when you go for not so heavy meal, for 3 people you would get awesome lunch/dinner in under 150/head."
3.0,Awesome Food. Great setting for sitting in the restaurant. It could have been better if you could focus more on services and get the food faster. I have visited four times your restaurant it's just because of taste of food. Silbatti should also focus on cleaning the tables properly and it smelling so bad last night when I visited. I know you folks are getting lot of people to your place but getting food faster and improving cleanliness may help you build more trust within consumers and bring back more customers. Due to last night bad service I may not visit your place again
4.0,It was a birthday treat and we were on the lookout of a restaurant near to the workplace..That's when a colleague suggested this place..walk-able distance from the place i work! its on the 19th main road..very rustic styled interiors and seating. The food was surprisingly very delicious and ample in quantity. the staff is courteous and the service is quick . The pricing too is moderate making this place THE stop for a comfy lunch/dinner!
2.5,"I would rate decent for the atmosphere at the venue and serving.   Apart from that completely not satisfied with the food.   Menu and pricebook looked good but when I ordered this Bangalore kebab which is supposed to be prepared with some secret mix turned out to be no secret at all. Sad. It's just simple masala on chicken deep fried.   "" Secret ""."
2.5,Veg food is non spicy and not a great taste...veg subji's were sweet.... Had lot of expectations... But didn't enjoy the food as expected...
3.5,Placed an order from this place. Took almost one and a half hours to reach me. Other than that the food was good..Chicken was well prepared thought it was sweet. Will go to the place to try out other dishes.
5.0,"One of the best places i visited yet. Open space, best service and i just loved the orange moctail. The manager was at his best.  These guys even lite up loban"
4.0,"With so many new restaurants opening in HSR, we are always left with loads of options. I chose this place because of it's unique name and the reviews on Zomato. Being newly opened, I thought of give it a shot but I must say this place deserves a rating not below 4.  This is located on the lane which has other famous restaurants of HSR, pretty much accessible, you can follow Google maps too.  The setup gives a feel of a dhaba with good comfy seating arrangement and lights. You can choose chairs, khaats or low height sofas. The music playing here gives you a great feeling, old numbers sung by new singers. A perfect place for a date or even to have a meal with friends.  Coming to the food, they have good options in the menu, for both vegetarian and non Vegetarian. We tried the vegetarian ones.  The aloo badami kebabs were delicious ones to start with. Malai kofta was yummy, I was actually striving to get a nice malayi kofta around. Cheese naan was good and yes they do have phulkas too.  Aam panna was a delight.  Overall it's a nice place and I will surely visit again."
1.0,Pathetic service. Confused ppl. Full of mosquitoes. They take hours to get the order. Food is average. Quantity of main course is good. Price is reasonable.
4.0,Had Ordered for delivery. Delivery was a little late but understandable since it was on Sunday afternoon.  Food was delivered hot and was neatly packed.  Butter chicken was awesome. No coloring used as done in many new outlets these day.  Naans were good and nicely made. Had also ordered jeera rice which was also very tasty. Not too oily.  Great exp.
4.5,"Food was awesome. Ambience was very good. Just some mosquito problem is there, I think which might be temporary due to rain . Overall very good experience."
5.0,"Wow is the word ......what a experience today at silbatti. Let me start with the ambiance very rustic desi ambiance very artfully done with outdoor setting of khatiya lights and clay jars for water. Seating was very comfortable.Then comes the food.wowww again. Starters was ajwaini fish tikka , lamb chops and roomali cheese cigars. Main course was butter chicken, biryani and chicken chaamps . Every dish was beautifully spiced and reallyyyyyyyyy yum. I coudnt decide what was better than the other. The icing on the cake was the bhaand gulab jamun. I mean who can resist hot jamuns but this was on whole new level with the rum flambe. If I have to tell my experience I would summarize as one of t h e best place in bngalore for very real north indian affair.  Thankz team silbatti for making me fall in love with your hospitality and food."
2.5,"Bland food, lazy waiters, too many mosquitoes all this cumulative into a not soo great atmosphere and experience, needs loads of improvements"
5.0,"The ambience is fantastic , food taste is amazing . they have variety in their menu.. The mango lassi is out of the world.. I'm a south Indian and I rarely prefer north Indian food. But this place has made me love north Indian cuisine.. Its worth waiting and having their food"
4.5,"We landed here by chance as were just crossing over from the restaurant. The name was catchy with nice looking facade. To our surprise, all that we ordered from starters Mushroom roll to Main course of Kadhai Paneer, Thepla and Biryani were all well prepared n in quick time. A great place and not so heavy on pocket."
2.5,Tasteless. We ordered kadhai paneer the safest option but it was absolutely tasteless. The veg kofta was also not great. Cheese kucha is absolute no. Service is slow .Ambience is decent. Overall not a great place
5.0,Great food! Friendly staff. Had an amazing time. Thanks folks :) will be visiting the place again for sure. Reasonable price too. Loved the ambience.
4.5,"After finishing final exam at college, we all friends were craving for good food. As we all were chilling at Hsr layout so thought to visit Silbatti.  Easy to locate as ambience from outside reminds you of coutryside with thatched roof.  Pleasant and comfortable atmosphere, we got Indian style seating.  Ordered for Chicken tikka, Chicken Biryani, butter chicken and roomali.Perfect taste, well balanced spices.Bhand Gulab Jamun was winner among all.  Budget friendly!  Courteous and well attentive service staff. Gonna visit again with entire gang before we leave Bangalore."
5.0,"Thank you so much for taking such wonderful care of our family during our visit to the silbatti. The food at the silbatti was always delicious! We had both veg and non- veg with special starter items. I tried the dal makhni and it was delicious THANK YOU SO MUCH for everything! We had a great dinner and you and your  staff jawed and ahmed helped to make it that way! We will be back again. Thanks again for all your hard work and consideration,"
4.5,"Great ambience took me to Silbatti last week for dinner. Dhaba like ambience but prompt service and amazing finger licking Indian food.  We tried  Tandoori Chicken- Tender chicken, well cooked & Perfect marination.  Dal Makhni- One of the best Dal in Bengaluru Roti and Ghee Rice. We also tried Orange Mojito, perfect for summers. 'Paisa vosool' experience. Gonna visit here this weekend also!"
4.0,"Visited Silbatti couple of days back for dinner. I liked the entire set-up that they have made, given it a village kinda of look and feel, with khatiyas and kullad like water bottles. As it was a week day we got a place easily. We ordered murgh mirch pudina tikka in starter and dhaniya adraki kukkad along with rotis and pulkas in main course. Service was prompt, the starter looked interesting and was delicious, the taste was pudina was quite good. Chicken was well marinated, rightly cooked, flavoured and soft. Quantity was good too. Main course were served within 5 mins after we finished the starters. The adraki dhaniya chicken was also nice, simple yet tasty. The rotis and phulkas were served garma-garam. In dessert they didn't have anything but gajar halwa, so we skipped dessert. Overall nice ambiance, good service and tasty food and pretty light on pocket too. Good meal! :)"
3.5,"The ambiance is a little different from the usual ones,they have a good variety of different vegetarian starters and all are tasty. The service is not that great also the place looks little congested."
4.0,"Location: The restaurant is located in HSR on the main road, therefore not difficult to find. However, you'll have to park your vehicle roadside.  Ambiance: The restaurant has a good ambiance with a village touch, where you can sit on 'chaarpaai' in the open area, if you're not comfortable, you can sit, inside the hut, on chairs as well.  Food: Food quality is decent, we ordered Dal Tadka, Methi Gobhi Matar, Rumali Roti, Naan etc and all the items were tasty. We also ordered one beverage which was very sweet and it was changed by the staff per our request.  Service: The staff is decent and they listen to you despite having so much rush. However, you might find the service little slow but I can understand that that was due to the crowd. The restaurant was completely packed and there was a waiting queue, even we had to wait for 15-20 minutes to get our 'chaarpaai'.  Price: Considering the food quality, location, ambiance and service, I didn't find this place overpriced. The service charge is included in the bill, therefore you don't need to pay the tips. One drawback is that Amex cards are not accepted, so I had to pay through Visa.  Overall, I would say that it is a decent place to have a food, I would visit the place again. I suggest them to start accepting Amex cards for the convenience of the customers."
4.0,"We ordered cheesy mushroom cigar which is shredded mushroom wrapped with cheese in romali roti. It tasted delicious, taste of cheese melting with mushroom was awesome.  But the winner was ""Bhand Gulab Jamun"". Well this is actually Gulab Jamun topped with fired alcohol. I loved it as the liquor took this Gulab Jamun to whole new level. Although I didn't had main course which I surely gonna try next time."
3.5,"Good and attentive staff - needs some training though.   Good food, nice rich taste at reasonable rates. Starters are worth giving a proper try. Ambiance is peaceful. Utility restaurant in my opinion :)"
1.0,"Pathetic service, absolutely pathetic!! Ordered 2 dishes, took them 25 minutes to deliver and all we had till then was 3 slices of onion in one plate!!  When the food came, there was no offering to serve the same. The staff was happily watching IPL match, but not bothered to tend to customers!! Post the main course we ordered dessert!   Waited for dessert for 15 minutes, all we got was the bill, which included dessert, but none was served to us!!!  For sure, never coming here again!!"
3.5,"This resturant caught my attention few months back ..right near to Cult with nice outdoor look you can find Silbatti.. If you are looking for good tandoor starters or nice Indian deliacies then this place is worth the visit. We have tried Chicken malai starter which is very evenly cooked with nice blend of juices and having right smoky flavor. For main course we have ordered Tandoori Roti,lal maans & chicken biriyani. Mutton was soft and the curry has authentic mutton kasha taste which I relished it. Roti was nice and soft. Chicken biriyani tasted average..chicken was little undercooked and rice overcooked.. At the end we had a filli nice sweet lassi..Price is reasonable and it wont burn a hole into your pocket. Ambience is very neat and clean with nice music at the background. Service can be definetly improved....Overall a nice dining experience and worth a try for foodies looking out for Indian or Afghani cusine."
3.0,I had visited the restaurant on 8th April with family for dinner. Food is quite decent and the cost is also apt however the only thing  which is not likeable is the seating arrangement & mosquitoes. It is a way too bad which doesn't allow to enjoy the food.
4.0,Decent Place with Staffs all over the place to greet you... Service was good...All the items that we ordered were very good. . drinks were decent. . .
4.5,Silbatti in HSR Layout was one of the first restaurants which I have added to my To Visit list and even though it is close to my place it took me months to finally make it up there. Me and my friend visited Silbatti for a late Sunday lunch and we absolutely loved it; the food was delicious and the place had a welcoming folksy ambiance. We parked right outside the restaurant and I do believe they have a parking ground across the road.                                                                 ...Read full post on sreeragnk.com
4.5,"I had been planning a visit to this place for some time. The ambience is pleasant, they have low seating, table-chairs and khaats (a kind of bed in rural India ). It is open air.  The staff is really courteous.  We ordered paneer lababdaar, daal tadka jeera rice, aloo almond tikki. For drinks it was buttermilk and aam panna. All the items were  delicious. Even in this hot weather we did not miss the ac as it has fans above every tabls  to be honest this was a welcome change. The portions are of decent size. Their veg platter is quite popular so going to try it next time. Lastly the prices, I found it to be total value for money out total bill for 4 ppl was 1k. I am going back for sure. Do give this one a try."
2.5,"The food is good, no doubt, however the service is totally chaotic, no one seems to know how to attend to a guest, totally and absolutely pathetic. Tables remain unattended and food takes an age to be served, seems they are totally disorganized and the management does not know how to run a restaurant. Completely unprofessional, this place can be avoided."
4.0,"An amazing restaurant with a earthy theme.. its a new restaurant and serves delicious food.. been here twice and both the times the food served was amazing. Chicken tikka are one of the best Non-veg starters here, also the curries are good.  Ambience:4/5 (must visit at night) Food: 4/5 ( there's always a scope for improvement) Service: 4/5 Hygiene:4.5/5"
4.5,"Bhaisahab, maza aa gaya! really good food, and swift service. Definitely a must visit for anyone looking for good north indian food in HSR. We ordered dahi ke kabab, paneer lababdar, dal tadka and gobhi matar methi. Everything was luscious!Will visit this place again soon."
4.5,"good food, ambience. quiet reasonable for the location & taste. good veg options. ordered: dahi ke kabab, gobi rohganjosh, masala kulcha, trikon paranta, subzi dum biryani all of which tasted nice."
4.0,"This is one amazing North Indian Restaurant in HSR. I had gone to this place on a Wednesday night for dinner with my friend. Their ambiance is really nice, as their sitting area gives you dhaba kind of a feeling. Their service is prompt and their food is finger licking. We had ordered one chicken ghee roast, murg lazzatdaar, shahi butter chicken, with roti and paratha. The roast was amazing and their paratha was awesome. In the end we had BHAND GULAAB JAMUN which was the best gulaab jamun in alcohol and flames that I had. A must visit place for all."
3.0,"Visited his place on a Friday Night. Welcomed by mosquitoes all around however this was taken care later! Kalmi kabab, alu benarasi, butter naan, aam panna few items on our list! Service : 4/5 Garnishing : 3/5 Flavours : 3.5/5  Over all not something I can vouch for , but can be paid a one time visit!"
4.0,This place is new in HSR....Went there for dinner....The ambience was nice with full dhabha feel...The food was awesome.. Ordered paneer lababdar...Very nice taste and also masala kulcha was nice....The best of all was aloo badami tikki.... Great food good ambience and good staff is what we experienced here...
3.5,"I visited with my wife for a casual dinner on Thursday night as this restaurant has been on my list of restaurants to visit.  Ambience:  I would not say it's one of the best place but theme is nice and pleasing. It is outdoor sitting on loose small concrete. There are many village cots and tables made of bamboo. People can choose where they want to sit. The entire restaurant is based on bamboo theme which is great to see. Indian traditional lanterns illuminate the place with LED bulbs inside them. Food: Since we were not much hungry, we started with Aloo tuk that  is basically whole small potatoes fried and mashed, served with green chatani, tomato sauce and sliced onions. It tasted really good ( 4 ). For the main course, we ordered Aloo dum Benarsi and Jeera rice. Aloo dum was good but not great (3 ). Jeera rice was okay (3 ). Service: Since it was not crowded on Thursday evening, service was quick. Water was kept in mud bottle closed with mud glass on the table. I asked them not to serve food in my plate. I give 4/5  to the service. Location:  It is situated in a great location on 24th Main. Parking is available on the main road itself. Environment is quite. There is a Pan shop just outside the restaurant. I give 4/5  to the location."
4.0,This is our third visit to this place and they never disappointed only  need to improve over crowd.Food was awesome specially almost paratha i tried was delicious.I went to other place only for paratha but this is the best.The ambiance took me to a totally feeling of Rajasthani...  And my friend had some kebabs are really nice tasty most recommended was til dil murgh ...Also tried lasssi and fresh aam panna was good too...  Will visit again...
4.5,"Awesome ambiance: lighting was gud, loved the seating arrangement and mainly inside area was mind blowing.Totally desi felling with aangan seating  in open air..Thank you guys to create such place in HSR..  Food: Food was awesome, mainly murgh rara was so tasty..In stater we order kind of cheesy cigar roll it was so yummy must try ...  Staff: cudos guys, u ppl really took care of each n everything until v got satisfied.  Keep it up ....."
1.5,"I have been to this place first time and may be last time. I loved the ambiance and for that planned to have good dinner evening at holi day (13-mar-17). But sorry to say i am totally disappointed with the service. Point listed below 1. Before starters main course came.  2. When we inform them , they took back the food and later starter came 3. Main course was not hot at all. They just kept it aside . They simply gave the food after starter  4. Orders cold drinks at the last but it seems they are using 2 lt bottols . When u open and reuse next time it will be just a suger water.  When i informed they changed the glass but again it was same.   If anyone this this post is fake feel free to contact me . I can give proofs in details. please do not  simply run the business. Try to give good customer service and more over listen to your customer."
4.0,Good food and good ambience for dinner. Service has to be improved as there were not enough servers for the crowd on Saturday evening. The concept was nice.
3.5,"Went here on a Sunday eve for dinner,luckily no waiting.The ambience was pleasant with soft  bollywood music and lamps hung around.Coming to food , authentic punjabi food taste.Sizzling paneer was awesome rest all the things were ok.The rates were normal and you can give a try here for a economical ,casual dinner."
1.0,The place smells of sewage.Food what we ordered was bad.Dahi ke kabab had no dahi but cottage cheese.Ghee roast chicken had no ghee in it but tasted like any ordinary chicken curry.Half of the mocktails listed weren't available and what we had ordered was terrible.So we didn't go for the main course. Don't waste your time and money on this place.
3.5,We went there from my school to celebrate our sports day ... That time we all were too hungry ... They took too long too serve... The taste of the food is average... But there decor and ambience is cool... They gave it a cultural touch... Overall so so experience!
2.0,"I have high hopes with this place but it turned out to be a total disaster for us. Few weeks back we went on a Sunday for dinner. We have to wait for 15 minutes to get the menu, once the order of placed the food was not served for almost 45 minutes though the person keep coming and asking whether it has come or not.  The stewards has no etiquette to serve food as most the time he comes to deliver the food he use to tumble the flower pot on me.  There seems to be some kind of communication lag within the people there which really pissed me off.  The food is just average.. We have ordered for Grill fish which was just covered with masala without any proper marination Ambience is the only saving grace for which I have given 2 ratings. Else not 1 rating too.  If this continues then I am worried that this place is sooner be going to shut down..  Disappointed.. Hope they rectify the same sooner"
5.0,"Awesome food!! I was wondering why I have not explore this place before. This is open air ..""gaon ka aangan"" food joint with really good desi stuff. I tried variety of kebabs, very authentic, very yummy. Taste of food is very nice. Made me feel homely again with good pleasant ambiance and service. will visit again"
4.0,Nice ambience and good food.We tried til dil murgh and dahi ke kebab for starters. It was amazing. And the paneer lababdar was awesome. Authentic punjabi cuisine and reasonably priced. Great food and service . A must try for everyone
3.5,"For a Sunday night, when you expect to get a table soon, we had to wait for twenty minutes. The ambiance was pleasant. Light music and apt lighting. We ordered kalmi kabab and til chicken as starters. Good quantity and taste. For main course we had sizzling paneer and butter chicken. Chicken was good but the paneer tasted stale. Roomali roti was fine. The service needs a lot of improvement. They gave us food but we had to wait for ten minutes for the cutlery and had to call multiple waiters too. They take too much time to serve too."
1.0,Pathetic service ...I wish I can give 0 rating ...hopeless... came with much expectations but they don't listen to customer itself....won't recommend anyone to come here
2.5,"Good ambience, super Punjabi style food love the fish  people serving are very attentive best part while having dinner it feels like your just outside Bangalore water given on clay mugs is another attraction - one should not miss jamun at the end - but there's a huge difference in the quality of food served at the restaurant and the one delivered - disappointed by the quality of food delivered - ajwaini fish kebab is marval  at the restaurant but the opp when delivered with a lesser quantity"
3.5,"Had been here for lunch with a bunch of team mates, has a dhaba type setup with open spaces with natural air and lighting. Seating would a bit uncomfortable for tall ones like me.  For starters we had veg shorba and vegetable kebab.  Shorba was fine but all the items in vegetable kebab was excellent specially Aloo badam tikki.  For main course had butter roti and paneer lababdar and gobi roganjosh both were just fine a bit more spicier would have been even  better.  Overall a decent place for a quick lunch, service was fast but the place doesn't seem to have a power backup so got a bit hot when power outage happened"
3.5,Thought of giving it a try as place is very very Close to my home.  Reached on right time and got seat of my choice.  Tried veg platter which was delicious but Main course didn't go well with me. We Ordered latpata aloo - nicely cooked but very very very spicy.  My whole time want in separating chilies from the Mains.  Ambiance and Service is appreciated
3.5,"We went for lunch here with couple of our friends. It's an open area hence very hot especially in this summer. Ambience is Ideal for a dinner setup. We ordered Tawa fired fish, Pudina chicken (don't really remember the name) and Tandoori chicken. Starters were tasty and good. For mains we ordered couple of different types of roti add Kadai murgh(not so tasty) and Nawab sheek gravy And this was yum. We ordered mint lemonade , sweet lassi and butter milk, lemon juice, lemon soda as well. All the juices were extremely sweet, and the sweetness just over powers the flavour of all of them, hence none of us enjoyed the drinks. And about the lassi it was good but I prefer the lassi shop 30 rupees lassi.. simple yet tasty."
3.5,"It's a nice place to have a dinner with family & friends. I love the food & especially the laalmans was authentic & delicious.Great Ambience. Lack of hygiene, the glasses were stinking.  The ambience is quite Dhaba style ambience but the cots werenot comfortable to have food.  Overall a good and nice experience. Ambience - 3/5Food - 4/5Service - 2/5Value for Money - 3/5"
2.5,Ambience is good with a dhaba like feel.  soups and starts are good but when comes to main course didn't find satisfactory. The quality and quantity of the food is not par to the price of it.  The only good thing about this place is ambience.
3.5,"Visited the place for dinner on Sunday, charming decor... The mocktail bar is not yet up so limited drink options were available, however the available drinks were good. The Veg kabab platter was amazing, all breads were good especially the rumali n cheese naan. Main course items were just ok. 1150 for 4 ppl.... Not bad..... Will visit again"
4.0,"Silbatti made me restore my faith on North Indian Cuisine.  Absolutely delightful menu and awesome food.  Great Ambience.  The only point they loose is because of the hygiene. Flies all around is a bit of off show for them. They must do something about it.   In all my earlier posts I have just whimpered over north Indian cuisine being stereotypical being the same red spicy masala with butter.  But this restaurant made me feel homely again. Fantastic Malia Kofta. These are the ones unique just like that if Ji Hazoor.  Pulav, Lassi some beautiful Indian Bread. Everything in here was super Good.  They have a range of drinks, Lassi was good but not great like that of Punjabi Joints.   A must Visit :)"
3.5,This place gives you a complete dhaba feeling. Right from  the decor to music and the seating arrangement.. Everything felt so good..The taste of the food was average.. Service was okay...However the main course and beverages were tasty.Loved the lassi here..Overall a nice experience...  Ambience 4/5 Food 3/5 Service 3/5 Value for money 3.5/5
4.0,"Went for dinner on Monday, surprised to see the restaurant almost full. Good ambience (nice village set-up with different sitting options). We tried chicken starters, chicken main course , deserts (gulab jamun, lassi), butter milk. Food was very tasty and presentation was also decent. They need to improve little on the service. recommended for a casual dine out option. Quiet and cozy place to spend time while having yummy food"
1.0,"Food quality is bad, slow and very costly, not sure why so crowdy probably people wanted to try new resturant but let me tell you not worthy even for single time."
3.5,"Visited here for dinner, had to wait for around an hour to get a table. They mostly have open air seating arrangement and few 'khatiya's, but I felt they are little uncomfortable to have food in. The service was pathetic. It took around half an hour for them to come and take order, but the wait was not over. The food came after another half an hour. The stuff are not very attentive. And I felt they are not experienced/trained enough. The food was good. We liked whatever we ordered. Paneer tikka, tanduri jhinga, kaju pulao, paneer lababdar, and a beverage. They have a good spread of menu, and food is tasty.  Ambience 3.5/5 Service and presentation 2.5/5 Food 4/5 Value for money 3.5/5"
3.5,"This place has awesome ambience for dinner as it's an open area with village look. Best place to spend time under stars in Bangalore. Prices are little high but taste is good, specially mix non veg platter, prawns were yummy."
5.0,"Excellent food, ambience and efficient service. Authentic taste matching with respective cuisine. Rustic and basic setting easily gels with the type of cuisine served"
5.0,"""SILBATTI"" is one of the very few North Indian Restaurants in Bangalore that does justice to the cuisine. Specially Punjabi and few from south region. At most North Indian restaurants, chefs are very liberal in use of desi ghee and/or butter and fresh cream to make food very rich in texture and taste !!But this is the place where you will get complete desi palate taste with less richness.....which we liked  Service bit slow on Saturday can be understand over crowd Music was good but too loud Ambiance -Totally desi with unique concept   Good experience ..will come back soon !"
3.5,"This place in on 19th main road in HSR, whereas the ambience is of totally Dhaba look.. they got good veg and non veg food. Sitting is very comfortable. This place can be enjoyed with family, friends or just with spouse. Food is good they have plenty of non alcoholic drinks like shikanjis, mocktails etc."
4.5,This is our second visit to this place and it was better experience.The food was amazing and the best part we always get a good suggestion from order taker and we go with same dishes.   to all food lovers just to try for some special regional dishes winch only Silbatti serve....  Keep it up guys good job...  Food 4.5 Service 4.0 Ambience 5.0 Music 4.0
3.5,This place was gud..Calm ambience...decent food.. Although service was Lil clumsy....N masala papad was bit stiff..Rest we order tandoori chicken wich was served in two half's...First half was perfect but second one was Lil burnt ..Over gud...Soup was fine not so attractive.rest garlic n pulkas were nice warm n soft... Main course gravy was decent..Chicken rara to.  Precise...the usp was the village style ambience n water served in clay pots...Over can be visited over again..
4.0,A newly opened place with mixed ambience of urban and countryside. Food quality is good too. Do try out vegetarian kebab platter in starters and in main course almond crusted kofta.
4.5,Loved the food. Veg n non veg both... Do try there butter chicken n veg mushroom cigars.                                                    ?.......................
3.5,The place is very new with evolving dishes. There were less variety of items available when i went there. Whatever they ordered was good in taste though. The outdoor arrangement of seating is a plus here. You can always head for semi candle light dinner with your better half. Perfect place for friends hangout. Must have is dahi k kebab. Thus makes a desi flavoured place.
4.5,"When food is the one true love for me, you have to go out on a date for it on Valentine's day. This newly opened place in HSR has been catching the eye for the way the place is structured.  This north indian cuisine restaurant has the highway dhaba theme incorporated in every aspect. The place is an outdoor place with low lying seats along the walls under thatched roofs and cots in the middle. The ground under the cots are layered with gravel, the walls are bricked and lamps adorn the walls and pillars with retro hindi songs humming in the background.  Luckily we get a seat in the cots and it truly adds more to your experience in this place. The menu is handed to us and we get down to choose the Tandoori Chicken (as the menu says - You have had more of it but still you crave more), Naan, Roti, Kadhai Murgh and Sweet Lassi.  As we wait for the order, we notice matka jar with a matka cup as lid for water and matka pots adorning the place to hold water. This was new and helped to keep up the authenticity of the place. The open view to gaze at the sky is a cherry on top.  The Tandoori Chicken arrives first and it is piping hot. The masala is well mixed with the chicken and it adds a good amount of spiciness. The dish is accompanied by a mint chutney.  The main course arrives next. The Naan and Roti were well made and the dough was light. The Kadhai Murgh which is an onion based gravy with chicken and spices made it stand out and complimented the breads to perfection with its sweetness. The sweet lassi was one of the best I have tasted so far. The sweetness wasn't overpowering and it was topped with a few pieces of tutti fruitti.   Overall everything was great. The ambience, the food and the service was very good. The bonus is how they serve all the dishes hot. The price and final bill were very reasonable. Would visit again just for the place as it is and sit for hours and eat the good food."
2.0,"We went for lunch... The restaurant has an earthy flavour, the seating arrangement is quite good and it's very spacious. You can simply sit for hours. We ordered chicken chaap, tandoori rotis and chicken biryani. Chicken chaap was not at all chaap, it was some sticky chicken semi dry gravy with curry leaves. Rotis were OK. Chicken biryani was better but you get better Biryanis at many places here for less price. Very pricey compared to the taste...  Had to drink tea for a change of taste..."
4.0,"Food: 4.5 Ambience: 4.5 Hygiene: 4  Peaceful place, nice ambience and courteous staff..They have a very good collection of old hindi melodies which make the place more pleasant."
1.0,Food is below average. Ordered one tandoori chicken which panjabi restaurants are famous for. It wasn't properly cooked.  Don't know how this restaurant got such good reviews.
4.5,"Nice place ,Ambience is good , you get the feel of Highway daba very neat and hygiene kids will enjoy the place ,The service is very quick and enthusiastic staff  The low lying seats one side ,khattas on one side which is beautifully sewn and placed around a bhatti placed right in the middle for guests to enjoy cozy warmth like bonfire in the open.A nice village feel you get when you enter this place .The menu is nice not very spicy food its a good choice for a good North indian food. The chicken was juicy and tender ,Rajma was yummy . A nice place to spend a good evening with family .Definitely visiting again"
4.0,"The ambience was good. We ordered palak garlic soup, dal tadka, banarsi aloo and phulka/naan.  The soup was really refreshing. The food also tasted good. Nice service and ambience."
4.5,"Punjabi food cravings?!! This is the place to go! and if you have been far from your roots for a while now, this is THE place to go! Enjoy!!"
3.5,"This is a newly opened restaurant in HSR sector 4. It serves North India food and mocktails. The food is decent. speciality is variety of parathas. Ambience is good as well. It has open air seating with top cover (it will be good to see if they make some arrangements during rains, as the sides of most of the seating arrangements are open.  There are basically two seating options. one is low seating catering to a group of approximately 6 people, other one is normal height chairs and tables with pebbles on the floor.  I would rate food as 4 on a scale of 5  Cleanliness takes a hit because of waiters dropping part of the leftovers on the pebbles flooring (Management needs to have a quick look into it)  Ambience is good both for a cool afternoon lunch and also for dinner."
4.0,This is really nice place to relax n hv gr8 food. Village like feeling cold breeze. It's really awesome. Though we had been there for lunch but I can imagine it would hv been gr8 experience for dinner as well. Service was okay as they didn't exactly served the food on plates.
3.5,Newly opened in HSR....  Bang on the min road... this place is an only open air restaurant....  Ambience is just like an highway side dhaba.... Nice n cold... Th entry is village like... 4 of 5 for the ambience...  Food was above average and sumptous.... Nothing extravagant but as good as any North indian joint... They serve water in earthen ware... Liked  Only thing I did not like was the menu make... Which was like a printed n copied papers tagged in file folders.... Relucatantly had to continue....  Maybe will visit once more.....
3.5,"@silbatti, quite a unique name for a restaurant, caught my eye since the time I had shifted to HSR.  Food: For starters, we had ordered Kasundi Fish tikka and Dahi ke kebab. The latter was extremely well made in the form of pan seared yoghurt patty with mint chutney. It was soft and good to taste and well cooked. Being a seafood lover, I expected Kasundi Machhi Tikka to be a unique tandoori item. It smelled of the oil used and the fish wasn't properly marinated and cooked. There was not any specific taste of the garlic in the same. Quite a disappointment.  For the main course we ordered Lehsooni palak dal and achari matki subzi. The dal was really good with spinach leaves all over. The garlic taste added a terrific taste to the dal. Whereas, achari matki subzi, made with an essence of pickle and all vegetables was spicy enough to be liked by a person loving spicy food. It was quite good to taste and complemented with the dal effectively.   For the breads we had ordered normal tandoori rotis, which were up to the mark.  Ambience: The best part about silbatti is its ambience. Made exactly in the form of a village, the ""khatiya"" and the table would remind you of a village with soft music. Other than this, you can either be seated on a table chair concept as well between the nets or on the floor as we generally eat in our respective houses, on proper mattresses. The bottles used to serve water was a unique thing to be checked out. A live music session was on where we can request our respective songs or even can sing there.  Hospitality: The waiters were quite welcoming and gave us quite warm arrival. The owner himself was quite humble and told us about the concept of silbatti.  Overall experience: Yes, great ambience, not so disappointing food, makes this worthy enough, with lehsooni palak dal and dahi ke kebab, a must try."
4.5,Good ambience.. Fast service and friendly staff.. Food is good and prices reasonable...  Pleasant place to hang out with group of friends...
1.0,"Pathetic is the word that perfectly describes food, service and courtesy of the management. We ordered a dish known as Badam Kofta and it smelled like being made from spoilt milk or expired Badam. After this was informed to the waiter (some middle aged buffoon) he gave a reaction as if it was out mistake that we came to this restaurant and ordered this dish. ""Ye to aisa hi taste karta hai sir"" was his response. Total paisa waste."
3.5,"We met for a family get together, and a large family we are! The table was booked given the holiday rush in HSR. When we arrived, the restaurant had no arrangement. We were offered separate tables. Why would a family sit on separate tables! We insisted on sitting together. After some pressure, we were assured of a bigger table, but for that, we had to wait approximately for 45 minutes. Finally after a long wait when the table got empty, we got to sit together. By that time, we had finished our soups standing, walking around.  Once we settled, the service was fast, staff courteous, and food pretty good. The food was fresh and served hot. We tried veg as well as non-veg items and everything was up to the mark. In drinks, liked their sweet lassi. Tandoori rotis were not too hard as I have found in other over-enthusiastic places. They were hot and not taxing on your chewing muscles.  Would I recommend this place? Yes for food and ambiance. Just be doubly sure about reservations and tables if you are visiting in large groups."
4.0,Good food. Nice village like ambience with desi songs. Good and fast service. Worth coming for North Indian food. Will come back again to this place
4.5,First thing I liked here is the ambience. Food is also good and is pocket friendly. We get a dhaba kind of experience with nice music in background.
1.0,"Sir there is a table but I have to see if the people are there in the car...you will HAVE to wait sir...(goes one way, then the other, comes running back) how many people again sir? I don't know if I should give you that table sir.sir...(goes one way, then the other, comes running back)..I don't know how much time you will wait but you HAVE to wait sir..I don't know sir.sir...(goes one way, then the other, comes running back).(we quietly exit knowing we never stood a chance)"
4.5,A less crowded chulha chowki 2 say d least...great ambience with a vintage dhaba theme...old hindi numbers keep playing in the background to compliment the theme...food is authentic...tried tandoori chicken n dum biryani n both were decent
3.5,Great ambience and food did taste good .the veg galotti kabab was tasty but quantity wasn't great .same goes for all the items . Do try the masala kulcha it goes we with the sabji . Their service is amazing and they make it an overall great experience . This place is pocket friendly nor quantiy is high but the food quality and ambience is what you should visit it for.
4.5,"A windy Friday night, the lodhi season, at 11 pm, to satisfy my food craving I found myself attracted to the blue silver and green light and ended up at this place. I loved the ambiance. There were pebble covered floor and village cots all over. We took the centre cot which had a small campfire. Perfect for that time. Given that I am a vegetarian, we ordered bharwan mushrooms, almond kofta, onion chilli parantha , a mango drink and gajar halwa with ice cream. All of these were good. A treat for mushroom lovers. The service was excellent. They didn't have gulab jamun with rabri we asked for nor the ""sizzling"" gajar halwa but the normal gajar halwa with ice cream was also good. I felt the number of staffs should be more. Apart from that, you can see the open sky. We went on a full moon night which was sort of perfect. We were there till 12 and it was still open. The best part was when we asked for the bill...Damn cheap. I think my Friday evening just got perfect. Thanks to Silbatti."
3.5,We came down here for a weekend lunch. The place was short staffed probably due to Pongal.  We ordered the Non Veg Platter which was good value for money. The Laal Maans was mediocre and the Kadhai Chicken and Paneer was nothing exceptional. The Lassi was a tad too sweet for our palate. The Masala Kulcha was exceptional.   The open ambience and the music were pretty good. A good place to come down for value for money food and if you have a big group of people.
4.5,"On the 19th Main opposite to Wrangler Lee store in HSR layout is this new Village like ambiance that has thatched hay roof on the corners, lovely lanterns as you enter, low seating for a group on one side, cemented seats for two and khaats beautifully sewn and placed around a bhatti placed right in the middle for guests to enjoy cozy warmth like bonfire in the open, breezy chilly evening. I did begin to like the place as we settled in. The enthusiastic staff welcomed us and helped us choose seats.  My first attraction was this pot. So each table has this nice earthen bottle like pot filled with water and inverted cute glass as lid. Instantly feels nostalgia. Was wondering if plates may also be of the same theme but no-they bring us back to sophistication of porcelain.  Quick came the menu and we ordered Dahi ke kebab and Amritsari fish tikka. The food came in pretty quick and I thoroughly enjoyed both. Dahi ke kebab was soft and succulent inside and crisp on the outside. Just melts in the mouth and tasted well with the tamarind and pudina chutney. Amritsari fish was fresh, juicy and flavourful. Loved the taste and portions (around 8) of both the dishes.   Well done on taking previous reviews/feedback from other guests well, I guess. I had a very good experience here, good service and humble staff who were keen to give their best-continuously and promptly attending to guests. Definitely visiting again.  PS: Absolutely easy on pocket and no long additional lines of taxes on bill."
2.5,"Went on a weekday at around 9:30 PM so found it quite empty. Hardly 4 tables were taken.  Ambience: I found it very pleasant in the middle of city with thatched roof, few colourful khaats thrown in under open sky, bamboo tables and chairs, and lounge kind of seating.  On each table instead of regular Steel/Glass jugs they had earthen pot   Service: Tad slow  Food:  Kalmi Kebab: was average. I was expecting it be on the smoother side  Malvani Chicken Curry: Average, nothing different  Roti and Naan: Regular affair  Suggestion:  1.	Food taste if improved this place will surely rock  2.	Music system and selection of songs has to be changed."
2.0,"Had been here with myfamily coz I heard good things and wanted to check it out for myself, but the outcome was not so good! The good wasn't so great, the waiters were not fluent with the dishes and so on! For the price you pay its not worth it!"
4.0,Ambience and service get top rating at this newly opened place in HSR Layout. Food is pretty good mostly. Serving size is quite big and foodies would love that! Pricing is in that sweet spot where you can enjoy a lot and still pay an affordable bill! Staff are extremely polite and friendly. The Punjabi dhaba ambience & Camp fire make it ideal for a dinner.
4.0,"Silbatti is a village kind of restra is in HSR layout. We ended up there on a friends suggestion one day. We were around 5 people and we ordered 4 starters, individual drinks for all of us, two main course dishes and butter naan. And the bill was below 2k for 5 people. It was yummy as well. The whole gives you a North Indian Dhaba feel. With very less options of North Indian food around."
3.0,"Food is ok, gives us a feeling of a road side dhaba  The traffic noise, the ambience and the staff is very much like dhaba   I would not go back for a month or so, but one eat there once a while.  Samosa alloo paratha is no no, masala Kulcha is above average"
3.5,"Been to this place last Saturday for dinner, its a village themed reastaurant. Ambiance is very good with small camp fire with hut style and coats for seating. Since we were little early for the dinner the service was pretty quick. Had butter nan with Dum alu banarasi, as mentioned in the menu this combination is super. We also tried panner tikka which is average not the best then sabzi dum biriyani, which is also good. Among the beverages virgin orange was best. You can easily find parking in front of restaurant since the stretch is not crowded.. But lighting in front of the restaurant is poor."
4.5,Went on Sunday eve with my friends to this village Themed restaurant and overall it was really a nice experience. Ordered the tomato shorba which was really good in taste. Kadhi pakora that I had reminded me of a authentic Punjabi restaurant in north India ( just mind blowing). Although they have a scope of improvement in their services as it wasn't that quick and we had to wait 15-20 mins before our ordered was served. A good place to visit with your family and friends.
1.5,Village themed punjabi restaurant. Not worth for money . Lassi was horrible . Prawn tandoori 4 pieces that to normal ones for 320 bucks ridiculous. Chicken starters were ok. Def not recommend . Quality and quality should be proportional to price but it was not the case here . Overall bad experience
2.5,"The 2.5 rating is for the Ambiance of the place. Table for 2 seating area was romantic.  Ordered tomato soup , Aloo & Chicken staters, Aloo paratha , Jeera rice and a Mojito.  Service was super slow and food was below average."
5.0,"I am a regular food lover. I visited across HSR Layout and found Silabatti a good restaurant. The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special mock-tail drinks(Orange), and specially the chicken items are very tasty. Especially the dinning experience was Superb. In HSR You will not get like this restaurant with light color and old hindi songs. I and my team enjoyed a lot here."
3.0,"Had been to this place on this weekend. It was a bit crowdy.  A village themed resturant  in open air.   Ambience was good.  Service wasn't quick. Tomato dhaniya soup was good.  Other dishes were just okay.  Not too much impressed with the food quality or service.  But at the same time,  a bit cheap as compared to other resturants with Okay okay foood."
3.0,Been here for lunch had chicken tikka and naan and butter chicken with jeera rice. They need to improve a lot in terms of ambience and time taking to serve food Food was ok.
4.0,It's a newly opened restaurant in hsr & can be easily located. The ambience is average & food is really nice . The service is quiet poor..may be they are understaffed at the moment. But the place is worth a try for the food.
3.5,"I went for lunch on weekend here. This is a new place, easily located on the HSR main road. The setup is fresh and beautiful with low couch seating, brick-lined walls, gravelled floor, lanterns and earthen carafe. For people who are not very comfortable with the low seating, there is the general table-chair seating as well. The centre is an open roof and this lets the breeze and sunlight in, enhancing the view as well as the experience.  The food was neither extraordinary nor bad. The presentation of the food was average.  Service was prompt and the staff were friendly  One thing which I really did not like was the loud hip-hop party music that they were playing in the afternoon.The place gives the outlook of somewhere where you would be chilling out on a lazy afternoon/evening. The music should be soft or even no music at all works. Moreover, the sound system needs a change since it was giving out cracking noises at times."
3.0,"New addition to HSR layout. the layout of the restaurant is rather confusing. the concept could be of dhaba style or a village style. The sheltered seating was uncomfortable I saw guest struggling in their seats, for elders its a NO NO seat. The idea of seating has gone a little out of place and never seemed comfortable, out side the sheltered area a few table were comfortable, the entire area is an open air concept. The design of the restaurant seemed to be half hearted. Well! food for starters we had a Non Veg platter which seemed excellent both quality wise and quantity wise except for the fish which was bland the mutton seek kabab was exemplary. for main course it was dal makhani with butter nan. Dal makhani, a regular diet was made badly, it did not have the required makhan and was horribly bland and tasteless, the butter nan could have been better. Overall an average fare. Do we visit again 'YES' there is plenty of scope for improvement, seems to be a promising addition to HSR layout."
5.0,"Ambiance is nice, open area.. found it nice and cozy.. Food is yummy, lahsuni palak daal and almond crusted kofta was just yum!!  Nice lemon juice and phulkas.:)  Staff is friendly and polite.. overall a good experience!!"
4.0,I think it's about 2odd months old the restaurant is superb nice outdoor atmosphere with a open like a dabba seating with some hearty food  Just love the full setting and lovely good  Good menu good staff well planned  And quite reasonable a good and a must try in hsr
3.5,"This place is quite and settling yet I believe ...we tried the rumali cheese fingers, cheese onion parathas, Palak cheese paratha, dum biryani , sexy sunrise and orange mojito..  Taste is pretty good. For somebody who likes food on the spicier band might find it a tad bit bland .. Orange mojito was not that good , just felt like orange juice with lots of ice !  May be there can be few more additions of drinks which complement the food there. Other than that the ambience and Service is good.  Service - 3.5 Ambience -3.5 Taste - 3.5 Value for money - 3.5"
3.0,"Quick Review. Rajma was just average. Salt was very less. Biryani.. didn't like it. Phulka were soft and good. Lemom soda was good.  Ambience is open and relaxing. That is only good thing here. Polite staff, good service.  They need to work on the taste of the food. Water was served in clay pot."
1.0,The worst place I have ever been in bangalore... Ambience:3.5/5 overall good. Feels good to sit in the comfy arrangement. Food: 2/5 horrible. Lot of salt in the gravy item. Chicken not cooked properly.  Service: 2/5 they are polite but amateur. They all are newbie. Not a single one of them is experienced.  Never coming back to this hell again..
5.0,"There are really very few Restaurants in Bangalore that serves great comfort food while exuding panache and style in terms of cuisine, creativity and ambiance. There is no denying the fact that Silbatti certainly finds a place among this special but exclusive list. The food served at this restaurant maintains a great level of authenticity while being equally generous at creative front. Service is extremely good and all staff seems jovial and are available for assistance ubiquitously. Entire purpose of dining out seems very assuring when you enter the premises of Silbatti. As you walk through the door with a thatched roof and enter Silbatti, you are immediately taken away from the hustle and bustle of the city into a parallel universe of peace and tranquility which gives you an immediate whip of sense that you have entered a place with a very rustic yet comforting rural scenery. Seating is very comfortable and you can truly let the sense of belonging to this place sink in, cherish the moment, listen to the melodious and soft retro Bollywood music, ponder about the food you wish to relish, order the same and get back to your business of just feeling good about the moment. Then you can pour yourself some cool water from Earthen decanter into your goblet and expect some truly luscious and decadent food coming your way. It is quite obvious that the food are quintessentially amazing and consistent. So, It is definitely cool to highlight and recommend this awesome restaurant. It would surely not be a folly to keep coming back for a unique experience over and over again."
5.0,Silbatti! The place is as unique as its name. The rustic look of this restaurant reminds me of my childhood memories of my hometown Chandigarh and the famous lip smacking dhaba food. The food is just delicious and very pocket friendly.  It's a perfect place to enjoy some great food and spend time with family and friends. I love their cheese parathas and Murgh Dum Biryani   The staff is so welcoming and courteous. Their unique mocktails are a must try!
5.0,Silbatti is the best Indian Cuisine restaurant in whole of HSR layout. Firstly what I like about the place is it's ambience which gives us that homely vibes. Secondly the food here is so tasty and tempting that you will be satisfied and happy. I will be a regular customer here as I have found the best chicken curry which they called MALVANI chicken curry. Kudos to the management of Silbatti who have created this restaurant to fullfill the desires of tasty food in an affordable price.
5.0,"Silbatti is one of my fav restaurant. One of the best place for North Indian food in HSR layout..A well set up restaurant, old Bollywood songs, light on ur pockets and homely food. A perfect place to visit for a good sumptuous meal and the experience was awesome. And now their's no counts of how much time I have visited this place. And still loving it.   Price  9/10  Taste  10/10  Service  9/10  Ambience  10/10  Value for money  10/10  Will I go back  Absolutely"
3.0,"Ambiance - 3 . Nice village atmosphere, welcoming, comfy and inviting. Would have rated 4 except for the fact that there was too much effort taken to give the village feeling in the place a complete experience right from having hoards of flies hovering. That could be taking a little too much into character.   Food - 2.5. tried gauolatti kebab, ginger lemonade, roomali roti, mint paranthas, roti, veg dum biryani,  dal Pancharatan, sweet lassi.  The kebabs were yumm. Soft well flavoured and served with some soft mini Indian breads as base. The lemonade was way too sweet and not enough punch of ginger though there were loads of ginger prices in the drink. Rotis and breads were all good. Lassi was too thin to be a lassi and too thin for being a buttermilk. The dum biryani had no ""dhum"" to it. Was rather tasting like pulao. The dal was good but could have been better.   Pricing - 3.5  Service - 3  I'm surely gonna give this place another try after allowing time for ya teething problems to settle down."
4.0,"Sunday evening .. I had been wanting to check this place ever since it opened last month. Went in with a couple of friends. All of us were simply awed by the interiors. A rustic rural look with simple decorations gave an air of celebrations, and the low seating ( they have table chairs as well) made the ambiance great. The earthern water bottles and the huge handi that they served us from were our topics of discussion that evening. (see pics) We had already decided that we will check different kinds of things from the menu. We started with a Tomato shorba and went on to order a dal Khichdi and Chicken Biryani with raita and shorba. The tomato soup was delicious,; right amount of tomatoes and the sour and sweet combo was perfect with mild spices garnished with coriander. The dal khichdi was amazingl... well cooked , balanced dal and rice and had that light taste of garlic that reminded me of home. The chicken biryani was a disappointment. I think because of the extra cardamoms that they had put. The raita and shorba were also great. I sincerely hope the fault with biryani was only an oversight that happened on that day.  All in all the food, ambiance and service was good and I'll definitely visit again for trying other dishes!"
5.0,"Loved this place, the ambience and the interior design is completely unique and one of a kind. Food is great and surprisingly very cool on our pockets. Had been there this weekend, service took some time but it's completely understood as the place was jam packed. Would recommend every one to try it once."
4.0,"Behold..even in demonetisation this place did not accept cards! As for my review ambience is kinda lazed away couches with a rustic hut like decor. Music was chillout types with 1/2 reggae songs as well in loop! Now it occurs to me they tried to give a shack like look in place in HSR!?!  this average due to the tandoori chicken ordered did not have any side dish onion, chutney. Sobit was jus strictly tandoori chicken..no side chutney / onions..ouch! However on demand the guy arranged some for us when we finished.. Lal maas (red mutton curry) was a good dish to go with tandoori nan (again which was not upto mark). So was the FLS - lime soda had little fizz. Decently priced but a definite place to hangout with a bunch of friends. Add on May 2018 they have got the card payment options and even opened up iftari food counter outside their place during ramadan. They have great biryanis n their tikkas are great taste wise."
1.0,The ambience looks great but then the service is too poor and the food too. It took almost half an hour to them to serve the not poperly baked rotis
4.0,I had been to this place for a lunch based on the suggestion from my colleague.. This place gives a new feel with unique design and seating arrangements.. The food was excellent and loved all the dishes.. Nice ambience and courteous staff.. The price range is decent as well..
1.0,"Went for the first time after reading the reviews but biggest let down.... The place is gud, songs are nice but the service is pathetic. Order for something and what we got was completely different on top of the management is not ready to listen and waiter's shows attitude as they are serving food for free...no manners . Guys u need to work on service and staff. They took back the gravy and gave the new gravy after half an hour. Guys please don't waste your time and money."
5.0,I found this place absolutely amazing.Ambience is nice and food is amazing.Chicken shahi butter masala is certainly the best chicken i have eaten in bangalore till now.They just need to change the menu card.It looks like my college days printed notes.Rest all superb. A Must visit place.
3.0,"Over all ambience and food are fine. liked the theme of terracotta and bamboo ambience,and even furniture and table setups r good, and three different type of seating areas..... food s fine not too bad.  And here it s though they r good with food and all, management s little bad, First of all no Proper menu , and the dessert we ordered from the menu provided is not available. and lastly when we were about to pay our bill there comes the shock, ""sir we accept only cash"", we were like ok.....At least they would have mentioned before we order our food. We can understand that they are newly opened restaurant but still these are basic things they have to keep in mind. thats why rating is low, food and ambience 3.5, management 2.5."
