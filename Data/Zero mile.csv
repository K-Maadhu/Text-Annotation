4.0,"This was my favourite destination for North Indian food in Bangalore...they have moved to new place and now no dine in only delivery/take away...I have ordered dal makhani meal, naan and lassi...somehow this time I felt the quality is reduced bcoz of price war..lassi was awesome..."
3.0,"Causal rooftop dine-in. Went for dinner with friends. Average veg food. Reasonable pricing. Dhabha-style seating. Good for large group, spacious seating."
1.0,Very bad taste of the food. It was all stale and also the quantity was very less
3.0,"Decent ambience. The starters were good. We had the lal mirch tikka, paneer tikka and the mutton seekh. Rotis and curry were okay, not that great. Pricing is economical. Overall an average experience."
5.0,First-time we came here for Team lunch and then we used to come here for regular dinner hangouts with my friends. Verity of North Indian food items are available. Almost all items are so good in taste. Normal wait time for your food get to prepare. Lassi is so nice and will fill your tummy. Nice hindi and Punjabi songs will be playing always. Good in service.
4.0,"The food is so delicious,it makes you feel you are just Zero Miles away from Punjab,otherwise speaking that you are in Punjab itself. Though the ambience is not that great but it surely is a pocket friendly place which earns it more stars. A must visit place for a Punjabi food lover. Speciality here is the Gudd ki lassi."
1.0,Ordered Dal Palak and Steamed rice on Zomato delivery. It can't get simpler than that! The Dal Palak was watery and there was dirt at the bottom! Steamed rice had a piece of nylon rope! Am at a loss for words!
4.0,I always order from here..  But this was not the starting.. Well..  So it's started like this..  Bangalore is very popular for Traffic we all know and aware and experienced that..  So we are stuck in traffic near Bommanahalli.. Because my office was there and my boyfriend came to pick me up ( Rare things sometimes happens..).. So we decided to visit some place near to HSR.. Because we both were hungry at that time..  So we ended up here..  And i fell in love with the taste.. Umm.. Everything is perfectly proportioned..  Quality : Tastyyy in one word..  Quantity : Enough for 2 persons even if you are too much hungry also..  Service : Very polite.. Service was good..  So how it started i mentioned.. Now it's a never ending story..  I actually order from here every 2days later..  #Shikanjeeamfanof #PeasPulao #Butterchicken #Lassi #Everydisheshereilove   #Ithinkamgonnaordernowagain #Mytastebudstartedmissingthem   So overall still very nice experience..
3.0,"The place sort of looks like a dhaba. Expected better food and was disappointed. Among the dishes ordered, only the mutton seekh and the chicken kabab were somewhat good. Also the lassi was nice. Otherwise it was a pretty average experience."
1.0,This is the sixth time we visited the place but for sure it was the last visit. The service and food quality both have fallen drastically. The order took 40 mins to come and we also noticed that the delivery persons were being given priority. When it comes to the food we ordered their special CK47 and Egg Curry with Punjabi Twist. Both the gravies were very tangy/sour and the CK47 was inedible. Felt like a whole sauce bottle was dropped. It was everything other than spicy. Would not recommend the place after todays visit at all.
2.0,Overall it's Ok Ok type... I won't say it's bad but not that good though. Almost all dishes are plain in taste. One good thing is that less oily and spices may be that's the reason. Staff is friendly and service is good. Given 2 stars because i feel price is slightly high in compare with taste. Can suggest for just a casual meal but not a place to throw a party.
4.0,Quite a unique restaurant which keeps its quality every time you visit...authentic north indian punjabi food is damn awesome...best dal makhani in Bengaluru perhaps and add to it their Peshawari kulcha...with jaggery lassi...and you are on for a delicious treat...keep it up...
2.0,"We went there for dinner with friends. Ordered paneer tikka and mushroom starter. Paneer tikka was not roasted properly and mushroom had raw taste. In main course, we ordered dal makhani, jeera rice, butter naan and paneer do pyaza. They were very plain in taste, no proper spice and salt and also the gravy was undercooked. I am giving 2 stars only for the dessert gulab jamun and lassi"
4.0,The place sort of looks like a dhaba. Had the rotis kebabs and the lassi. The kebabs and the lassi were excellent. Pocket friendly place which is definitely worth visiting once.
4.0,"Its an exclusively punjabi, family restaurant.If you love North Indian dhabbha food, this is the place you are looking for.  -Location :Main road, no worries. -Ambience :Beautiful, rooftop, homely. -Food:Exclusively North Indian, great at its taste. -Service :Polite."
4.0,"Came here last week. Had kebabs, tandooris and lassis. Did not try anything else. But i loved the kebabs here. U can try a variety of kebabs here."
4.0,"Very good place for punjabi foodies. Authentic bitter chicken with tandoori roti. Those tandoori starters, and sweet lassi. Its hard to focus on diet when you are at such a place. Nice ambience, good food. A good place to be at."
5.0,"Its a very good option to have food from here, ordered kadai panner from here and the taste is absolutely amazing and tasty, the curry portion , taste and spices and panner is properly cooked making overall experience of food taste and quality amazing. u should try out once here."
2.0,"the food wasn't at all ""Punjabi"""
4.0,"Good place, great food. We went on an evening with friends and it turned out to be really good. Vegetarian food were delicious and do try their lassi. They serve food on roof top with some bollywood music."
5.0,"Checked in to this place with absolutely no expectations and was pleasantly taken by the authenticity in taste of each item served to us. I've rated below the dishes we ordered.  Dal makhani - 4.5/5 Paneer tikka masala - 3.5/5 Amritsari Kulcha - 4/5 Peshawari Kulcha - 3/5 Tandoori Roti - 4/5 Gur Lassi - 4.5/5 Plain Lassi - 4/5 Butter milk - 4.5/5  Ambiance - 3.5/5 Service - 4.5/5  Pros : Friendly owner, quick service, tasty& authentic food, reasonably priced items  Cons: not easy to locate  Must try - Dal makhani and Gur Lassi  Head to this place for some real good Punjabi food."
1.0,"today I ordered tandoori chicken, it was too bad to taste, I will never order again, very disappointed. very bad food quality and the delivery boy was too rude."
4.0,Authentic Punjabi Taste Wow Food... Staters are Just Awesome.. The only thing is Service is not great as food but worth waiting if get taste
5.0,Wanna explore punjabi food best place to carve out is zero mile punjab chicken chatkora is just finger licking... sikanji is one of the best welcome drinks  to have and wil refresh you.
2.0,"Today I have visited this restaurant after seeing a nice review in Zomato.But I am quite disappointed with the food quality.We have ordered mutton sheekh kabab , Amritsari fish,naan ,chicken Aag baboola and lassi. Sheekh kabab was good.Amritsari fish was not at all good and this is no where similar to actual Amritsari fish.Chicken Aag baboola was not good.It might be possible that we did not order the signature dishes.But overall it's not good."
5.0,"The food was amazing. All items, dry or curry... very tasty. Portion size was small for everything but it was worth the taste. I would love to order again."
1.0,Very bad experience..I ordered butter chicken and it has full of sand..Some ingredients might have fell down and they have taken it from ground with sand it looks like..Friends please avoid this place..I will never order food from here again
3.0,"Went here because of the Zomato gold. Ambience was good. Service was really great. The staffs were friendly and courteous. The place was little hot as we went for lunch and its in the terrace of the building. Coming to the food, it was really okay-ishhhh. We had three starters, sultani seekh, lahsooni tikka and lal mirch tikka in which the latter both tasted the same . For main course we had CK-47 (the best of all) and some khada chicken. The peshawari kulcha was also good but oily. Finally the lassi was really good."
4.0,"I went here three times with my friends for birthday treats. The food is good. the chicken starters are must try. Veg gravy items are also good. The price seems reasonable and for dessert, you can have the lassi. They have varieties for that in quantity. Satisfied with the experience."
4.0,"A must visit place for your love for Punjabi dishes, rooftop ambience makes the experience even better. I tried chicken tikka masala and would rate it 4/5 , only concern is that the service needs an improvement big time."
4.0,"While searching for some North Indian restaurant in H.S.R, got to know about this. Food is good here...had chicken kabab here and it was really tasty.Special Lassi is famous here....If u want good food ,u can go for this place."
5.0,This is the best place for punjabi food in Bangalore. My favourite dishes are soya chaap and sultani aloo in this restaurant. You will go again and again after 1st visit. Great one.
3.0,As I walked in was happy with the rustic ambience and the punjabi music but the delay in service was a huge turnoff. Finally after a reminder when my server brought my starter I asked him about the delay and he said because I ordered a non-veg starter. I was truly surprised by his absurd response and responded back accordingly. The Tandoori chicken was piping hot and had a great taste however the mutton seekh kabab could have been cooked a bit more. Dal makhni was definitely not a home run considering when a delhiite has had a taste of authentic one. Loading food with butter and ghee does not add value if the flavours are not there. Started well but disappointed with the service..did not meet expectations!! Will give it a pass.
3.0,"Starters were good, but the main course was not nice. Place is decent and nice punjabi music is played. Non veg food is better than the veg!"
4.0,"Amazing Food, Quick Service. The Broccoli and lassi are a must try.  It's a must visit for vegetarians and punjabi cuisines fanatics. We have been over three times and never have been disappointed by the food."
5.0,food is served hot n on time
4.0,"Good food and prompt service, but to be fair not much rush too, on a Sunday evening. Only thing is as a vegetarian, you will be bored as most things are paneer only. Loved the lassi."
5.0,This place is one of my most favourite Punjabi restaurant in the town. Be it the rooftop ambiance or be it the simplicity of the restaurant or be it the yummiest malai chicken/malai paneer I just can't control my self from entering to zero miles Punjab while passing by. Unfortunately don't have any pictures as I go busy with the food the moment I go inside. I just couldn't stop myself from giving a 5 rating here.  When it was in ecity that time also I used to be in this place frequently. Then i thought they closed it but again when I found it back in HSR I was just more than happy.Love this place.
3.0,T hought of pure vegetarian hotel but got disappointed. Had to wait for lift to work as it was stuck because of dust coming from road (according to hotel owner). Later need to climb a floor so not advised to go with senior citizens.
3.0,"Food is decent, not that great. We don't like the ambience too much. Also there was couple of times service confusion happened when we visited there"
1.0,"The cleanliness of the hotel is well below standards. Hotel is not well maintained. However the food was not bad. But when compared to the price of the food, they should at least maintain the place with some hygiene. It's in the 5th floor, when I went, the elevator was not functioning. Another thing is the hotel is right in front of big drainage canal, the smell of that has caused vomiting sensation after coming out of hotel. Personally I don't recommend this place for anyone."
5.0,The food is too bloody amazing! Eating a good meal after a day's hard work is so satisfying and mile Punjab is too good at it. Loads of love to the team and the food . Keep up with the good work :)
4.0,"Little hard to find. They went full dhaba mode. By the looks of it, restaurant doesn't seem much. But the taste they offered was really surprising in a good way. Will definitely visit again."
5.0,Great place to have Punjabi food. Loved their starters. Main course is average. Have visited this place many times and absolutely love their starters.
3.0,Visited this place on a Sunday evening. The place is very congested and they have very limited number of staff. The quality and the quantity of the food was very poor.
4.0,"The food is good here.  Ordered tandoori chicken, the pieces were tender, juicy, aptly spiced (4/5).  The chicken tikka masala is nice, had good pieces and the serving size is fine. (4/5)  The cleanliness and service of the place needs improvement (2.5/5)."
4.0,"Good place if you are craving for some punjabi food. Dhaba style ambience with some good punjabi songs in the background. We ordered Murg LalMirch Tikka and Fish Tikka for starters. Both the kebabs wer soft and juicy.  For main course we ordered dal makhani and Ck 47. Daal Makhani again was were really good and strong in flavour.  CK47 suggested by the waiter was okay. The gravy had a strong tomato which didnt suit our taste buds. Definitely going their agin to try their other dishes.  One suggestion to the management, please work on your serving time. It sometime gets annoying to wait for 30-40 mins even for the starters.."
3.0,"Went to this place with friends. We ordered tangri kebab , tandoori gobi and panner tikka as starter.All were super spicy.  Ambience is ok. Food is good. Service is ok. Each order took min 30 mins to get served. The overall experience is ok.  My Rating:  Food : 3.5/5 Ambience: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Value for money: 3.5/5"
3.0,Pretty Average yet expensive food
3.0,"Situated on roof top but covered. Last floor does not have lift. People who cannot use stairs may have a problem.  Food is good, however over last 2-3 years the taste has dropped. It used to be amazing and was my goto place. It still is good though. No complaints here. Try Chatkora chicken.  Service is 0/5. This is the prime reason i have reduced going to this restaurant. Only when the owner is there (Not Uncleji) you could see him going majority of the work and ensuing things are moving. However when he is not around, you have a tough time getting the order. Might stop going soon if it does not improve.  Price is decent.  Ambience - Dhaba theme. Sitting comfort is fine as it is all wooden chairs. Prefer the wooden seat over dirty cloth based sofa which may not be cleaned properly.  Cleanliness - main area is clean. Not sure about kitchen. Rest room is generally dirty."
3.0,"Visited one weekend to try this much talked about joint. Ambiance: Dhana themed, clean but chairs a bit uncomfortable. Good songs were played in the background. Food: We ordered peshawari murgh tikka - it was good. In main course we ordered rara gosht. When starting eating one wont feel the spices at all. It tasted a bit on sweeter side. But as you go on then a bit of spices will take effect. All in all, an average preparation. Rotis and lachha parantha were good though. Service: This part is disappointing. Had to wait nearly 30 minutes for our order to be served. Yes it was served piping hot but waiting 30 minutes is a little too much."
1.0,Worst food .Spice level is too high.i never thought thought that Punjabi food is like that .yak don't ever tried that .true suggestions.spoiled everything
4.0,Good service with decent price and musical ambience. Chicken chatkura being ZMFs authentic dish is worth the try. We gave it a try on last visit and its was yummy every bite.
3.0,"A place for good punjabi food. Went there with some friends, with my Zomato Gold benefit on food. I had ordered one Punjabi Paneer and One Dal Tadka. Paneer was decent but really liked the dal. We get options like tandoori roti, phulka etc. The ambience felt like is not so decorative, very simple. I wanted to rate this place 3.5 but since I can't, I have rated it 3. The reason for being low in rating even the food tasted good is their not so good service. Our order was served late and I felt that the quantity of Punjabi Paneer was less and in the end, when we ordered Gulab Jamun, surprisingly one piece was served hot and other piece was served cold for which we had a good time laughing over it."
1.0,"Bit overpriced. Taste is not that great. Ordered starters. Quantity is way too less as compared to price.  Service is pathetic. We ordered two aalo paratha. They forgot to serve curd with second one. Upon asking they brought a separate curd. When we ask again, then they shown very rude attitude. Didn't say a word but facial was expressing.  If you guys can't handle more customers, close the shop or put full board outside."
1.0,Ordered paneer tikka and got sheekh kabab instead. Apparently an error on the sorting table but surprising given the starters look nothing like each other. Guess they need to upgrade their sorters. Truly disappointing experience!
5.0,"The food in here is tasty and affordable at the same time. The service at this place gives you a personal and warm feeling. The decor is basic yet somehow is apt for the setting they are trying to portray.         As far as the food goes the lassi in here is a must have and their vegetarian preparations (especially bhindi fry) are to die for. In short if you are looking for the North Indian punjabi dhaba feel, this place is definitely worth a try."
5.0,"Punjab lunch r always my favourite n they never have let me down till now..but today this restaurant gave me no words to speak..it was outstanding..d food I must say I never expected it to be soooooooooooo delicious..as per d place its a small space up in a rooftop dining..and d food v had ordered masala papad, chatpata panner, aloo papad ki sabji, phulke, lassi and masala chaas...everything was so tasty..but d best of al whic took my love was their chatpata panner n masala chaas..do try it out guys..n d prices r also nt very high its much reasonable..its a  frm my side"
3.0,"Decent food, good service, reasonably priced North Indian Punjabi food. Worth a visit for the punjabi craving now & then. Will recommend the Lassi & malai kabab."
3.0,"Have always loved the food here. But preparing the food always takes a lot of time. One would expect food in a restaurant to take no longer than half an hour after ordering to be served, but lately, they seem to be taking anything between 45-60 minutes to serve even starters. That is disappointing.  I used to go here a lot for office lunches but have stopped doing so, solely because I know they will end up taking a lot of time to serve my food. But yea, I must mention the food here is delicious and if you have a lot of time on your hands, do visit."
4.0,"Best Punjabi food I ever tasted in HSR area. We had ordered basis Dal Tadaka, Roties and Pulaw and it was simply awesome. The restaurant is on top floor if you find it difficult to locate it."
1.0,"I really want to say one thing this is not Punjabi food at all, Order chicken Keema, anda mazedar , mushroom Punjabi all have one thing in common will are having  base, food is so sour couldn't complete finishing it. I think they have this tomato base kept ready and they use it for every dish ... Generally don't write review but it's really very bad experience to digest."
1.0,"Ordered food looking at the good reviews but was utterly disappointed. The naan felt like 2 year old chewing gum, the lassi which was supposed to be 400 ml was only 200 and felt like powder, paneer was just okay, looks like popularity didn't suit this restaurant well"
3.0,We have ordered food from this restaurant... Dal khichdi was very tasty but color Was disappointed. It suppose to be in yellow colour. But they have sent in green color why I didn't understand.. ... Packing also good... But u need to improve ur lassi packing.  Rest all are good.
1.0,"Ordered Butter Chicken, Laccha Paratha and Garlic Kulcha. Butter chicken was moderate in taste and the pieces were small. Gravy was sour and they gave too much of gravy to make it look like big portion size but piece sizes were disappointing. Have had much better butter chicken from other places for lesser price. Also the mint chutney had extra salt in it and was not edible. They could have given some vinegar onions or some side salad as all Punjabi restaurants do. But it was poor. Don't really recommend this dish from Zero Mile. Spending 400 bucks made no sense."
1.0,"Staffs are very unprofessional, very unhiginic environment. Food are horrible. All item gravy having only onion and capsicum. I will not recommend the restaurant to anyone in this price range."
1.0,"This place used to be good but the attitude of staff and the service has gone extremely bad. The quality fortunately is still maintained though but service is where you guys should actually be focusing. I went there today, and received the starters after 1 hour of ordering them and it was not even peak hours, while one of the starters arrived after the main course was served. On top of all this, the waiters hardly bothered nor were they considerate about anything. Definitely crossing this restaurant off my list now. Not going there anymore."
5.0,"A frequent visitor to this place, must try for authentic punjabi food.  My favourites are tandoori and lalmirch tikka. Their Dal makhani and murgh tikka masala are best in town. Songs and ambience - 5/5"
4.0,Decent food with no compromise on quantity....Only concern was with Naan which as thin as Pappad....Place looks ordinary with a concept of Dhaba Style...Zomato Gold members should carry their ID or else they would deny the 1+1 offer....Luckily I had  Overall review Service - 5 Food - 4 Decor - 4
5.0,"I had ordered from the restaurant on 24th Sep and it was raining heavily in HSR. No delivery person from Zomato showed up at the restaurant so the owner drove down and delivered the order personally !  Amazing sense about customer service. It's not just food that makes u remember your orders, it's these experiences!  Khush Kar ditta sardarji !!"
3.0,Lazeez Chatriyan dish was nice. The person who served us was kind. Nice roof top place. But didn't meet the expectations table arrangement and crockeries
2.0,"Visited the place for the first time, though the place didn't meet our expectations, it's a decent place to hangout. Service was good. Staff were kind. Veg starters are worth a try. Main course tasted average. Ambiance wasn't appealing."
5.0,One of the best North Indian food to have in Banglore. Great service and delicious food. Proper authentic taste with delicious spices and gravy. A great place to visit
2.0,Most overrated restaurant. Pathetic service. Food portion/Quantity is very less though price is high. For cold drink of MRP 18 they will charge Rs 40 + GST. Not enough staff. No care about services. I have rated 2 stars because food test were ok. That too vegetarian starters were not good. Water bottles kept on table were dirty. I will suggest not to visit here because there are many good restaurants in HSR.
4.0,"This place is one of regular places, the food is real authentic Punjabi and if you love Punjabi food then you can order anything, you will definitely love it. Beware CK47 dish is very spicy as written in the menu, I didn't read it carefully and found myself in trouble next day morning. Starters are the best in the place. You can find pulka as well. Rates are low as compared to other restaurants but you won't find the place ambiance so classy. You can find Punjabi, Hindi music all the time ;)."
1.0,"I ordered lesse paneer combo, the paratha was not good. Paneer was ok but not that good. The Gulabjam and the pappad was fine. Please make it better."
2.0,"Service was not upto the mark and it looked like they were understaffed and overwhelmed with online orders.  Unmarinated babycorn was served , menu mentioned marinated.  Butter roti was ordered initially itself, after 30 min Waiting it informed that Roti will not be available.  Overall experience was not good."
2.0,"The food was great but the service was pathetic. We ordered everything in one go but it was sent to the kitchen in bits and parts making us wait for 15minutes between each serving. Also, ww ordered butter milk and shikanji and we were told that shikanji is not available untill we asked thrice and finished half of our meal. The rating is only due to the good food."
4.0,"I always love to go this place when I want to have some authentic Punjabi food, mostly I am a fan of butter chicken so I like their butter chicken with roti, awesome place for north Indian food. It is located on the main road near to silk board and is roof top but is covered. Must try their chatpata paneer Tikka and paneer lababdar awesome in taste.Must improve the service"
5.0,A five star for the chicken and paneer kebabs.. ambience is ok ok.. the service is a bit slow for starters.. professional and courteous staff.. planning to revisit it soon..
1.0,So unhappy with their food#lotsofoil #badtaste #rubberchapati!! Some one suggested me to go there but i am so disappointed!!!! #willnotorderagain
1.0,"This was my first time visiting the restaurant. Never expected such a rude a staff. We had an 1+1 offer from Zomato so came over with my colleagues. As soon as we entered we told we had 1+1 offer to one of the person there. Initially the waiter was good and served food properly. While issuing the final bill, we told him to calculate the based on the offer we have. He refused and said we did not tell him initially. After sometime he did accept the same but then started talking to us in in very rude manner. Started asking our I'd cards and others.  Lastly he did not give us the full benefits of the offer which was expected as we had 3 Zomato golds. Finally we paid and pledged to never step over the place again. Please guys if you want to have a bad time please visit the same.  I don't have the bill right now. Else would have put up here ."
3.0,"If you love kebab , this place would be awesome..chicken malai kebab is absolutely yum..paneer malai kebab just made my day..too much soft paneer with juicy taste..i just loved it.. apart from kebab i did not like anything honestly..main course is below avg in taste .. and in dessert section also you wont find much thing..that also most of the things will be unavailable... rooftop restaurant ..ambience is good..all over avg experience..."
3.0,We wanted to try the authentic punjabi preparation and we went there  Didn't like the ambience and it was a very cold welcome  Service and staff need to be groomed a lot. Btw OK for a noisy bachelor gathering
4.0,A very understated restaurant. The food is really tasty. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. The ambience is good. The place even has a paanwala at the door!
5.0,"Have tried almost all non veg curries, never disappointed. My favorites are chicken tikka masala and chicken kalimirch. Lassi is very refreshing."
5.0,"Must try their sultani aloo and paneer methi malai. I also like their gur ki lassi. The rates are pocket friendly and quantity is value for money. Overall, never disappointed here."
5.0,"Located at the rooftop, this place serves amazing North Indian food, I love their peri peri chicken tikka and tandoori chicken. CK 47, their signature dish also is very good."
5.0,"My go to place in Bangalore for good punjabi food. Highly recommend paneer tikka, Masala rice and paneer methi malai. Music in the background is very refreshing."
5.0,"Loved every bit of my food from ZMP, I am a constant here and never get disappointed with the food. Favourites are their kulchas and chicken tikka madala."
3.0,It is a family restaurant with a good Punjabi style food. Quantity & quality of the food is good. Some of the items are overpriced and also not good.
2.0,quality gone down
3.0,Great food but mediocre service. Its our pet once-a-week dinner place since they serve some of the best punjabi delicacies but much scope for service improvement.
5.0,Best north indian food Tried almost every dish... Amazing.... Being a north indian and suffering from south indian food in bangluru..... this is best
1.0,Got bone in the veg food. Pathetic explanation given by Manager and Restaurants owner and  He doesnt have courtesy to accept the fault. Could have given negative ratings as well.
2.0,"Not recommended. Food was below average. When you start finding potatoes in your dishes, things get really weird. We tried Punjabi Mushroom and Veg Jhalfrezi for main course and both were pathetic. Chatpata paneer tikka was fine for starters. The only good thing was Gur ki Lassi.  Service was also not good, even though the place was empty."
3.0,"Zero Mile Punjab is a dhaba cum restaurant located on the Outer Ring Road close to Silk Board towards HSR layout. The outlet is on the top floor in the same building as Sakra Hospital. The ambiance is of a typical dhaba with wooden chairs and tables. The walls were a bit shabby.  We ordered the Anda Mazedaar and the Mix Veg Curry along with Rotis and a glass of Pudine ka Pani. The order took more than 25mins to arrive when the expected was only 10mins. And the Pudine Ka Pani arrived after the curries. The food served was super hot. Both the curries were great in taste.  We also ordered the Peas Palao with Roasted Papad. The Roasted Papad was not crunchy as they were baked in Tandoor. Not a great experience! Why not bake them on the stove? Anyways, the Peas Palao was delicious and we ended up eating more than we should!  The Verdict:  Food/Taste  7/10 Service - 6/10 Ambiance - 6/10 Value for Money  7/10 Quantity/Quality  7/10  Good Food, bad service and too much waiting!                                             rohitdassani.com"
5.0,superrr
4.0,Craving for Punjabi food? Then this is the right place for you.! We had - Malai paneer tikka - 4/5 Sultani alloo - 4.5/5 Jaggery lassi - 5/5 Rooh afza lassi - 4.5/5 Punjabi paneer - 3/5 (very disappointed) Dal makhani - 5/5 Amazing All breads were nice Peshwari kulcha is a must try.  The ambiance is also nice specially on cool nights.
2.0,Junglee babycorn is very bad in taste and is not cooked properly which feels like eating raw babycorn But chatkora is good and really nice in taste but Junglee is very bad
4.0,"Food is really good. Quality and Taste is really nice Ambience will give you the freshness. Staff's were professional and polite. Pesawari kulcha really awesome. They made good lassi here, everyone try that once.  One thing I didn't like about this restranut is they took to much to prepare food. We ordered at 7.35PM but they served first starter after 8.30. More than an hour we were waiting. This should be improved.  Good place to go with family and friends. Who doesn't like alcohol and SmokingFree zone this is the place for them.  Zero Mile Punjabi- Value For money"
1.0,babycorn is so bad that we have to order from outside
4.0,we had ordered panneer cheese paratha but we received aloo cheese but food tastes good
4.0,"Have been to this place twice so far and had a great experience in terms of food. I am a big fan of their Butter Milk. It has a generous amount of cumin powder and coriander leaves, making it a refreshing drink. For starters, we ordered Sultani Aloo which tasted delicious with the mint chutney. Love their buttery Dal Makhni and Murgh Makhni (Boneless) too. The quantity of their main course items is really good. If you are craving for some authentic North Indian and Punjabi food, you should definitely visit this place for a scrumptious dinner or lunch.  Just that it was weird when they asked us to show our ID proofs for Zomato Gold. This never happened at any restaurant. Also, the music is too loud."
4.0,"Good food and quantity, will recommend to others. Thanks"
4.0,Good but a bit much spicy.
4.0,Good in taste but as usual for Punjabi food more oil..
2.0,"It wasn't masala kulcha at all, just an half baked naan."
5.0,No need to go to Punjab! Awesome food. Quality and Quantity.... ambiance is good. Friendly staff. Chicken chatkora in starter is awesome. Lassi is very tasty. It's on terrace. Roti and nan are nice and soft.
3.0,Generally the food here is good especially the paneer dishes and chicken dishes. Was a little disappointed with the dal palak and mix veg type gravies.
5.0,good
4.0,"Very nice ambience. Staff behaviour was also very polite and helpful. They will suggest you good food. Food was superb, both quality and quantity wise. I felt the place is worth every penny. A good experience overall."
5.0,"Let the food do the talking. It is such kind of place which will hardly ever disappoint with food. The location and ambiance is average but will be great if the place gets a proper makeover.  Must Try - Chatkora Chicken Malai Tikka Kastori Kebab Lahsooni Tikka  Soya Chaaps here are a delight. For mains you can try CK 47, Bhuna Chicken, Specials paneer, Garlic Kulcha and Amritsari Kulcha are a must have.  Service is good and prompt and they listen and cooperate well to understand if there is any problem and sort it out. Thumbs up for that  Recommended."
4.0,"Love the food here! It's almost always quiet and peaceful and parking is not really headache. I always make sure I order the Bagaare Chawal and Dal Tadka with whatever else we order. The Murgh CK47 and Aag Baboola are nice, though not as spicy the spice lovers would like. I prefer less spice, so find them nice. Also, the butter naans are awesome. But aren't they everywhere? :)  In the evenings, mosquitoes may be an issue. On one of my trips it got a bit much, but been good otherwise. Only other suggestion is to amp up the hygeine in the wash area. Tends to stink a bit at times and they leave random plumbing etc around or use that area for storage. Knocking a star for this."
3.0,Overall a budget place with little ambience. Need to improve cleanliness. Looks like a Dhaba at roadside in Punjab. They use too much of oil in the food. I like the place for lunch but need to improve quality of food and cleanliness
3.0,Mushroom and baby corn starters were not good. Paneer starter was good(soft paneer). Slow service. Main course was good. Ambience was okay but can be improved.
5.0,"Great place to have punjabi food in HSR. Try Nawabi Dal, tadka in ghee Is great. The most important, service time was very less and food came instantly."
5.0,awesome food.. great taste
5.0,"Authentic North-Indian Tasty food with their LASSI, at this rooftop restaurant, right beside the National Highway, becomes a must-stop place for anyone who has had its experience.."
5.0,"Had dinner with friends...good food, good service and worth the money spent... Recommended!!!"
2.0,I ordered 4 gulab jamuns and got 3.5. One was leass than half the sise
3.0,not authentic. too spicy
4.0,Tasty but extremely spicy even when the dish said it was medium spicy.
3.0,"Had a good decent punjabi meal in hsr on a very hungry weekend lunch. Very basic and promising. Also had a very good service with which seemed liked the owner, when i ordered from here. And thats 140words for this place!"
4.0,"Authentic Punjabi taste and quite a good portions are served at partially opened rooftop with a basic interior. Loved the food they served, from Tandoori Starters items to Lassi/Butter Milk. Paneer to Chicken dishes. Even there Dal-Chawal was yummy.  Rada Chicken is a must try.  They need to work on the hygiene and slow service."
1.0,"Not worth visiting , they take 40 mins to deliver 2 simple dishes . The food quality and taste is less than above average. Very unprofessional service."
1.0,wrong items. bad food
4.0,"First time I visited this place last week. The food is pretty standard. And being in HSR, it's an easy lunch. Lassi is a standout. Even the chaas is very good for this summer heat. Coming to food - the achari paneer tikka was good, and teven the chaats are very nice. Main course pretty standard."
3.0,Place which need serious makeover. It is delivering value for money with decent food but hygiene is missing badly.  Dal Makhani and egg masala is really good.
2.0,It was totally burned.
2.0,Super spicy. Chicken pieces werent good.
1.0,Spicy n oily no taste
4.0,tasty food and quality stuff but was oily though i requested less oily and spicy
4.0,The food tasted so punjabi and the quantity was good enough. Must try place. The special lassi is the highlight. Nice ambience and hygienic place.
3.0,"Visited this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. The ambience is very ordinary, honestly I think it is bad. They haven't maintained it well. There is plenty of seating space available.  For food, we ordered chatpata paneer Tikka which was very good.  Also ordered punjabi paneer, dal makhani, breads and rice. Dal makhani was great, can't say the same for punjabi paneer. Punjabi paneer didn't taste great and I didn't like it. The rice and breads were good. For drinks, ordered buttermilk and Lassi. Baith were great.  The service is slow and food took a lot of time to arrive. The staff is courteous and polite. They must improve on the ambience and service. It isn't maintained well, they must improve on that part as well to provide a better experience."
3.0,"Been here with a friend. NO PARKING for this place. The ambience is good but the problem is during the Rainy Season. The water somehow comes inside but not messy. The food tastes really good and the prices are little bit higher for the quantity and mainly, although we were the only customers in resto during the time. It took them more than 25 mins to serve."
3.0,The place looked nice but the location ruined it all. The smell from outside from was a turn off and on top of that the sevice was too slow. We ordered achari bhindi in the hope to get the real taste but again it was disappointing. It was all burnt and for a second I was confused if they served us the karela(bitter gourd) sabzi.  To save the hunger paneer was at the rescue. Punjabi paneer was good and edible.  Along with that lacha parantha was up to the mark but again butter nan became hard by the time we finished the lacha parantha. In all paneer and lacha parantha could suffice us.
5.0,Good food. Really yummy.
5.0,just asked for a free nan and guess what they did delivered one. Service and food was very good overall.
4.0,Nice place to have tasty Punjabi food at a very reasonable price. The ambience is ok. This place have a roof top dining. The staff is friendly and you should try and reach there before 8 to avoid waiting times.  We ordered Veg food and the taste reminded me of dhabas on NH1 near Murthal all the way to Punjab.
5.0,awesome tandoori chicken
5.0,"I am changing my review due to events that happened after placing the order.Just when I reviewed that the food was not good, the owner reached out to me immediately and checked with me what went wrong.I really liked the way he acknowledged the issue.Even though the food was not good but his behaviour really cheered me up. :)"
4.0,"If you are looking for great food at decent price and ambience, this is the place. As the name suggests thought it's not actually authentic Punjabi type cuisine. But whatever they serve is great on taste. The ambience is decent. Service is quick. Staffs are friendly."
5.0,Great place at HSR!  Worth the money! Quality food and Gesture!  tandoori chicken was beyond my expectations! Fish tikka that melts as u taste! Had a great experience.  #Punjabi_food
4.0,"The most delicious North Indian food in Bangalore till date. It's a rooftop restaurant in HSR layout, with very simple design and furniture, but the food says it all. I ordered soya tikka, Dal makhani, Punjabi paneer, garlic naan and Amritsari kulcha. The food was served in less than 15 mins, and the food was perfect in all parameters. For crazy food lovers, this is the right place."
5.0,First thing first ....i got the most punjabi vibe as soon as i entered ...which was warm and welcoming The food taste great ...and the prices werent so hard on my pocket.....not sure about home delivery ......this is a place id visit every now and then to have good food and time .
5.0,"I remember mom left for a marriage to the north, and my dal chawal diet went for a toss. For a spoilsport I've been, never learnt how to cook. One fin day I ended up at ZERO MILE and my ey s first went down to palak dal and I was excited. I'm not kidding, shouldn't be saying, sorry Mumma, but the taste was almost similar(actually better, shhh). Get here if you want the typical Punjabi food taste and also home food. Clean and clearly the best place to jump in anytime for a great meal! I'm all for WORD OF MOUTH."
5.0,I had an amazing experience.when you are actually away from home.the best homely food is right here. The most amazing dish is the FISH TIKKA. guys believe me the Real punjabi food is just here @ZMP.
2.0,"in my advice please stay away from this place if you really want to have real authentic punjabi food. the only thing punjabi at this place is the name ""Dhaba"". we ordered two chicken dishes and both were blunder."
2.0,Not really awesome food. Just average quality and need improvements. Waiters just talking instead of taking order. Roti quality was really bad subji just average.
4.0,good
2.0,"I went there with my wife on a Sunday for dinner. After waiting for around half an hour just to place my order and then waiting for another twenty to get it served, I found food which was substandard in taste. I would like the management to take notice as people usually come to have an experience rather than just waiting."
5.0,"Authentic Punjabi Food . Must try are Murgh Chatkora, paneer methi malai, dal nawabi, Dal makhni, gur kee lassi, butter milk, Peshawar kulcha, Murgh makhni.  Do not forget to mention any custom needs in preparation. They attend to it well. Pricing is moderate."
3.0,Taste was good but to spicy
2.0,While dal palak was good veg kadai was practically uncooked
5.0,Tasty Food
5.0,"Amazing aura, superb food. Just a punjabi dhaba that gives you an amazing feeling everytime you sip or have a bite. Kudos to you guys. You rock. #LivePunjabiEatPunjabi Ambience - 4.5/5 Food - 5/5 Crowd - 4/5 Service - 3.5/5(only for speed of service) P.S. DO NOT FORGET BUTTER CHICKEN AND THEIR CHAAS!!!"

5.0,Good food  Good ambience very nice place  Loved the Nawabi Dal and Murg Kali Mirchi   Will keep coming again  Staff very courteous and cheerful Love to come back here again
4.0,"Decent punjabi dhaba in hsr with decent food. The food taste is not up to the mark if u relate it to Authentic punjabi cuisines. But chicken handi was super tasty. Great job on that. Ambience is nice, overall this looks like a family restaurant."
2.0,Not a good experience. The management is not friendly. The service is super slow. It takes ages to get your food.Food is average. Need to improve a lot.
3.0,It's near to my office. So i have been this place many a times. Do not expect too much. For daily meals you can choose this place. Ambience is not great. Price is also ok according to that place. Whatever I have ordered till now I liked it. Taste is good. Staffs are polite and friendly.
1.0,Phathetic Service... I didnt like the atmosphere... It was just ok... Food... Didnt try because got pissed off when they didnt serve the food on time...
2.0,We had lunch in zero mile Punjab today ; I dont have any complaint about the food . But the place needs a big make over ; very shabby area of restaurant and very dirty wash room area . Please improve it if I have to come back
3.0,** Delivery Review  Ordered a Lazeez Paneer Combo & Makhani Combo  Cons:  - Gravies are below average both paneer & dal makhni - Breads (Kulcha & Lacha parantha) were not even properly cooked - I didn't know kadhai paneer with extra butter could be called as Paneer Makhanwala....  Pro's: - Decent portions - Gulab Jamun are amazing  There is nothing great about the place.... I am sure you will find plenty of better options out there
3.0,"We group of friends have visited this place for some authentic punjabi food and it left us with some mixed feelings.  The seating immediately reminds you of a dhaba. It's on the 5th floor , but a closed one. Atleast they should have opted for both closed and the rooftop. Since it is entirely closed it can get really hot if you're visiting it during the mid day. The seating was okay.  Coming to the food , We opted for the Pyaari Pyaari Paneer (Peri Peri) and the Sultani Sheekh. The paneer was soft and delicious with a lot of spices going on. The sheekh was okay.  For the main course, we chose the Murgh Handi , Dal tadka and of course Tandoori roti and Jeera rice. The handi was very well made and gravy totally reminds you of the punjabi style. Dal wasn't that great , looks like they didn't even add the tadka on top of it. The taste was completely flat. Tandoori roti was okay , Jeera rice was again a disappoinment.  They should probably improve their quality for the price. The service can get a bit annoying as you need to call them and remind about your order."
5.0,Superb .
5.0,"Dal Tadka is very good here, just like home-made."
2.0,Kulcha was okay in quality and packing is not proper
3.0,Food was really great Altough I did not receive my Complimentary treat !
3.0,Food: taste is good.. close to authentic.. second best after Pindi banglore in HSR.. Ambiance: They should improve ambiance.. tables look as if they are not cleaned for days.. good music.. Cost: Price is unreasonable for the quantity they provide.. Service: Very good.
4.0,very good
2.0,Did not receive the zomato treat free dessert. Food was fine.
2.0,different item received .
2.0,"Average north Indian food. Not really that great as that of nearest competetitors. Not worth the money or taste.  Location is okay, food need improvement. Not very hygienic."
5.0,Very nice Tasty food. only concern is their packaging sense
3.0,"Food was good, enjoyed it, but ordered full lassi and delivered half."
3.0,"Visited this place for a weekend dinner. The place is located in HSR and the restaurant is on the rooftop. The ambience wasn't as lively as I expected from the Pictures.  Ordered the basics, Chicken tikka for starters which was good. But it had a hint of sweet to it which I didn't like. For Mai course tried a chicken gravy with Roti, the gravy was again kind of sweet, which was no where close to Authentic Punjabi flavours. The rotis were fresh and the quantity was sufficient too."
5.0,Excellent and mouth watering food. Highly recommended.
5.0,great.
4.0,Very good Punjabi food served at Zero Mile Punjab. Really loved the veg and non veg curries here. Will recommend this place to the Punjabi food lovers.
5.0,Every single dish ordered till date is delicious.
5.0,Search for good North Indian food ends here. Chicken gravy is a must try. Good ambience with songs. Starters were filling and the cost is okay.
3.0,Not good as we ordered last time
2.0,I ordered Boneless Chicken Makhani and got only 3 pieces of chicken in it. Rest was only gravy..
5.0,The best north indian food in Bangalore. Polite staff. A good overall experience!good fresh hot food served!i would recommend this place to everyone!
4.0,good food
5.0,Food is appetizing. Have ordered endless times from zero mile punjab and its still the first place which comes to mind  while ordering north indian food.
2.0,Delivery boy was the worst. he passed in front of our house but did not deliver. also didn't pick up our phone. we called 8-10 times.he came back to deliver after 30 minutes and had no explanation for his delay
2.0,The true test for any Punjabi restaurant is the quality of its butter chicken...if you can make a awesome butter chicken then you have successfully passed the test.... unfortunately zero mile Punjab fails miserably in its butter chicken test.... the butter chicken ordered was a absolute waste. An overpowering sour lemony flavour ruined the whole dish and all you could taste was lemon killing all the other flavours ...the dish had like five small pieces of chicken which also was not flavoured well. I guess these guys don't believe in tasting their own dishes. Had ordered veg food a couple of months back from them and was impressed with the taste and quality ... ordered non veg and they fell flat on their face...
5.0,personal care taken by the owner was truly professional.  great job
4.0,"So I went to this place the other day, all thanks to zomato gold. Okay I have ordered food earlier from here and was not very impressed. But boy, this time they Completely turned around. We ordered paneer tikka lababdar, dal makhni, mushroom kadai, butter nan and tandoori roti. Out of which paneer and nan were completely amazing. Dal was having less cream but I liked it that way. The best part was food was not having too many spices which generally punjabi restaurants overdo. And it was light on pocket also.  Food-4.5 Price-4.5 Ambience - 3.5"
4.0,tandoori roti is like paratha
1.0,Worst food ever and cost of food is too much not worth it and the service is also very bad. I ordered one paneer and one mushroom with 15 phulka and dal tadka with jeera rice so in my opinion they charge like 3 star but worst service and taste.
1.0,"i didn't like the chicken, it was bitter"
4.0,"It was 3 of us. We shared a  Large glass of lassi (400ml) A murgh peshawari tikka A dal makhani  A pindi channa And 4 tandoori roti, 1 kulcha and 1 butter garlic naan. All of this for just  under 1100. Definitely good value! The place had a decent ambience and service was a bit slow at times. However the overall experience was good!"
4.0,very good taste
5.0,finger licking food
5.0,a must visit for food lovers...tasty food....homely ambience....nd excellent service...a perfect setup to dine out . special care is taken to suit your taste .
3.0,"Food was good , ambience was also good. Service should be improved, owner was polite after initial complain he responded and tried to improve the service"
5.0,"One of the regular visitor to to ZMP. A signature Punjabi restaurant in HSR.  ZMP's food quality & taste is at a different level & they never compromised on this so far. Every item is unique, tasty & value for money.  Must try item for veggies are Sultani Aloo, Paneer tikka, Mushroom Punjabi & Methi Matar Mushroom. Also don't forget to have famous Shikanji."
4.0,"In the middle of HRS location and aside from the Bangalore traffic Zero mile Punjab is situated on terence location .The ambiance is like an another eating place but a semi garage look . but the kind of food which is been served by the restaurant completely complements the ambiance as well .We ordered for the aachari bhindi , roti and gur waali lassi every thing which we ordered absolutely prefect by taste and flavor as well which we relished tell end.You wont find much of variety into their menu but whether you will find its quite satisfactory to taste .  Something new to taste is Gur waali lassi which is quite moderate in sweetness and quite lively in taste must try suggestion from my end.  Price is moderate neither to high nor very low but as i told before its complements with the taste completely  Cheers to team Zero mile Punjab :)"
1.0,"It was an absolute zero experience this Sunday afternoon!! We went there for lunch and it was such a horrible lunch I personally had experienced in long long time. Nothing seemed to be good there. We walked inside on roof top and no one were there to help us accommodate our seats ..all the staffs including the owner at the cash counter was so engrossed in counting cash that he just didn't pay any heed whatsoever. So service and staffs disappointed us big time. Now comes the food ..we ordered one sultani chicken seekh kebab, butter milk and rara chicken in main course along side roti and some phulakas. To start with kebab, it was very dry and not juicy the way we like seekh kebab to be. Butter milk was just average. We were hoping Rara chicken would be great as we have tried this dish in all the Punjabi restaurant across Bangalore But sadly Rara chicken was a big disaster ..they made it sweet in tomato gravy ..felt very bad for the chicken that we wasted as we couldn't finish our meal. I thought about ordering a dessert but just got reminded by the bad exp we had with starter and main course. I don't think we will visit there again, we have better Punjabi restaurants than this around HSR and Koramangala."
1.0,"I'm still shocked after visiting this place yesterday for lunch! Never knew I would be having one of the worst experiences!! I wanted to visit this place since a long time as I'd thought of it as a typical dhaba type setup with authentic Punjabi finger licking cuisine, but couldn't really get a change to visit this side of HSR. As they had 1+1 on food, I finally planned to go there for lunch. Firstly, the building in which this 'restaurant' is, is like half functional, or kind of semi-shut! It said the Zero Mile Punjab is on the 5th floor, but there was no 5th floor in the elevator...Oh, maybe they thought people will auto understand that it is a 'roof-top' place..fair enough! Once we entered the restaurant, it was a small place, with some tables occupied and many unoccupied. We were looking out that someone from the staff might attend us to a suitable table, and the uncle ji at the counter also looked at us, but said nothing...wao...don't remember getting this kind of hospitality off late!! We found a table ourselves and settled. The place was boiling as it was a hot afternoon, and we had NO fan above us...O, unlucky we!! An uninterested looking lady came to our table, without any greetings or smile she wished to take our order and went away. God knows what was wrong with her, she didn't even smile an inch! We ordered for a chaas, sultani seekh kabab, rara chicken, phulkas, roti and a chilled mineral water bottle. Water bottle wasn't chilled. Chaas was served in 2 minutes, which was again just at room temperature. Starter was served after 15 minutes..I thought they would be making it very fresh and hot. Was very hungry and looking forward to the food to be served. Sultani seekh looked nice, but I took a bite of it I was so disappointed. It was DRY, and nowhere how a seekh kabab should be. It was very difficult to eat the 6 pieces served. The chutney served along with it didn't help at all. And we just left it. Then came the rara chicken, roti and phulkas. I was surprised looking at the rara chicken, it didn't look anything like rara at all! We dug into it. There were 4 pieces in it I guess. I took a bite, and DAMN, it was sweet!! Never have I ever had a sweetish rara chicken, made this bad! The chicken pieces were hard, as if it was stale and the chicken was kept frozen for daysss!! We had asked the attendant to make it 'less spicy', which they read as 'sweet'! We couldn't eat or finish the food. I felt very bad on wasting food, but couldn't help it as it was unconsummable!! Overall the place was tacky, the handwash place was filthy and I'm sure the kitchen was the same! The tables and chairs are burning in the afternoons as it's a roof-top place. Staff is rude & uninviting; service is super slow. God knows how this place is functional with such food and service in a competitive place like HSR that too with a 4* rating!!"
3.0,food was cold and too much space
2.0,Came for the first time very disappointed... Starters were okay but the main course was just way too disappointing for me... Mosquitoes added to the experience.... Bhuna murg was flop for me.... Tangadi kabab was okay naans were elastic at the last went to handwash and found the place very filthy..... Sad I am
1.0,delivery was as always late by zomato
4.0,"If you are looking for a place where you can get authentic punjabi food this is it. I have visited this place multiple times its a nice happy place and the food is also good and tasty. Kadhai paneer dal makhni and masala papad are awesome. The paneer paratha with cheese needs to be little better as it is very dry and tastes average. Shikanji is quite nice and tangy, gur lassi needs to be better as it doesnt taste sweet and the pieces of gur coming in ur mouth are more disturbing than refreshing. Overall a good experience."
4.0,It's been quite sometime since zero mile Punjab has shifted from electronic City to HSR. We used to be frequent visitors to this place when it was in electronic City.it gives you this Authentic Punjabi dhaba feels. Wanted to try their outlet in HSR this time. Food they served was fine . When compared to previous experience in electronic City food did not live upto the expectation or may be the choice of our food selection today din love upto expectation. None the less it you are craving for Punjabi food do visit this place.

3.0,"Pretty much all the dishes we ordered tasted sweet though it had two chilli against it in the menu (expected it to be spicy). Staff was good, good music, but food didn't suit our taste buds."
3.0,Liked the food but restroom and hand wash in bad shape. Can do better on cleanliness in general. Ambience and setup is okay best part of package is food. Good place to take out not the best for eating in place.
4.0,"The first week of mine in Bangalore, I wanted to have something different. I 'zomatoed' and found about this place. It was difficult to find the building and even difficult to enter as the elevator was malfunctioning. The first impression was bad.  Once we reached the 5th floor, we liked what we saw. It was a minimalistic place. Nothing posh.  We ordered Kebabs, Chicken curry, Roti and Lassi. The kebabs were heaven on a plate. Fresh chicken, cooked to tenderness, and with the right flavors. Just so perfect! The Chicken curry was okay, but the lassi blew our minds. It was thick and had an essence of some sort.  I realized you really can't judge a place by its outer appearance. Go here to have their kebabs. :)                                                                  rangelz.wordpress.com"
5.0,"Situated in HSR sec 6, above Sakra World Hospital. This place is in 5th floor with good seating arrangement and ambience. One of the best north Indian cuisine restaurant in town. They have a limited menu which offers great food . Very polite staff with prompt service, they play Punjabi music to keep you feel active. We ordered murg kastoori tikka, mutton punjabi, jeera rice and phulka(tawa roti). We received our order quickly. * Kastoori Murg Tikka :- It was similar to reshmi tikka but with a different twist. It had little pinch of kastoori methi on it. The tikka had very good smell. The chicken pieces were also soft and of good size. This is a must try dish . It was very good. * Jeera Rice and Phulka ( Tawa Roti ) :- The Jeera Rice was of good quantity, quality and taste. The Roti was one of the best tawa roti I had in Bangalore. It was soft , and it didn't had any extra flour over it. I was very happy with Phulka and rice. *Mutton Punjabi :- This is also a must try dish here. It had loads of gravy with butter mixed in it. The mutton pieces were soft and of good size. It was not much spicy.  *****Must try dish : Murg Kastoori Tikka and Mutton Punjabi.*****  Rating : Food : 5/5 Service and Ambience : 5/5 Seating Arrangement : 5/5  Zero Mile Punjab Keep up the good work. I will definitely visit again. One of the best places I had dinner in Bangalore. #HappyEating"
5.0,order delivered on time.. thank u..
4.0,This place has been one of my favourite in this area for its authentic tasty Punjabi style food. They serve good food in Dhaba ambience. Murgh Chatkora starter is finger licking delicious.  The Owner also takes customer feedback seriously.
4.0,"The place is pretty average priced. This review is based purely on vegetarian menu as we are vegetarians. We had pyari pyari paneer tikka, which was really tasty with its tangy flavour. And achari bhindi was also tasty , with bhindi all dry and spices. Jeera rice and dal tadka was decent The quantity is more than enough for two people and maybe they could improve a little on their ambience. The waiters are well behaved and food takes a while to get ready, but the music and ambience in evening will keep u going., and to top it up, shikanji was cold and must for a summer afternoon but it could have little more tangy flavour of tangy masala blend in it. Overall, good food, average ambience, and upright music ."
3.0,"The food quality was average. The naan and kulcha ware good, however the chicken taste was not so good."
3.0,Too spicy
3.5,"This one is a decent place to go to. It has a roof- top, dhaba kinda setting, which is very cool. The food is good and you'd feel like visiting again. Also, they've got a great playlist! I enjoyed every song that they had played."
3.5,"It's a rooftoprestaurant.Great food. Ordered Murgh Chatkora and Muton Punjabi with Phulka. All tasted spicy and great. A very decent option for Punjabi food. Price is slightly on the higher side, but the food is worth it. You'll have to wait for at least 15-20mins for the food to be served, but it's worth the wait. Can improve the waiting timings on food. Food - 4/5 Service - 3/5 Ambiance - 4/5"
4.0,"Food here tastes pretty close to authentic punjabi food. Unlike most other North Indian restaurants in the city, they have kept the recipes mild and flavourful. Even the humble yellow daal tastes good. Rotis are just like home made ones, and gulab Jamun is absolutely delicious. I love to get my weekend fix of Aalu paratha and lassi here."
3.0,We went for some Aalloo paratha and gobi paratha experience... but they weren't that good!  the Ambience is of a proper dhabha... probably next visit the butter chicken and chole is something i wanna try!
5.0,"as usual, was up to the expectations. thanks."
1.0,very less quantity of paneer kadahi....and too much  spicy all things
5.0,"Value for money. Food 5/5 Service 4/5 Ambiance 4/5  Food was delicious, Dal makhni and lassi must try. Best Punjabi restaurant in Hsr Koramangla."
4.0,"Delicious food . Dal makhni is a must try. Punjabi gur ki lassi u will not find better than this anywhere in bangalore ,good service ,a decent ambeince and a value for money."
1.0,first the delivery was late and then coming to the food...it was way too spicy and oily
3.0,"Food 3 Service 4 Ambiance 2  This place is on a building roof with lift access only till the floor below. Probably the season but we had issues with too many mosquitoes.  The starters murg Lal mirch tikka and cheesy taang were very good even though I felt cheesy taang was a tad bit highly priced. The meat was tender and juicy. I did not however enjoy the main course. While the dal makhni was Ok, the naans were soft, chewy and difficult to tear. The ck47 is a spicy tangy curry unlike any other Punjabi dish I've had and wasn't to my taste."
1.0,"not sure why this restaurant is so high rated. Food seems extremely normal, nothing more than homemade. Waiters are not well trained/mannered."
4.0,"Had one of the best north Indian cuisine experience in recent times and the reason was - Zero Mile Punjab. The best thing is the quantity they serve compared with quantities of the other eateries ( its nearby ones and eateries in general) The quality is brilliantwith every dish bringing its own taste in a very different way. The delivery was on time. Curious to experience a dine in some day. Keep up the good work guys, really appreciated."
3.0,"We had comparatively better experience the last time.I will give this to you, the Gulab Jamul was a treat for the tongue.But disappointed with Rara Murgh as well as Bhatti keKumbh."
4.0,"This is by far my favourite North Indian food place. I love their food. My personal favourites are Dal Makhani, Methi Malai Chicken and Laccha Parantha. This is definitely my go-to place when I am craving North Indian food.                                                                 bhookhibella.wordpress.com"
1.0,what the hell was that ... masala papad i ordered and he rolled the papaed and gave masala separate... bc
4.0,"Ordered a light Chicken Meal Combo from this place. The taste was good and everything was delivered hot. However, I would have appreciated more if the chicken pieces were a little bigger."
3.0,"WOW Dal, so so Chicken"
4.0,Gravy portion is pretty good. Papad aalo sabzi was made nicely and satisfy the taste buds.
5.0,"Evergreen place to enjoy the yummy food, authentic punjabi food with lot of veg and non-veg options to choose from, service is good though there's a decent wait time"
3.0,"We visited this place based on the ratings on Zomato. But turns out to be not a good experience for us, that may be another bad day for chef of restaurant. We are ordered Dahi ke kabab and Sunday special cheese tikki, Both were full of oil. Then we ordered Palak paneer which was very off the mark. We complained this to the manager also, but he defended with saying this is the authentic Punjabi flavour. Never going again."
4.0,food was very good
4.0,"Just had Murgh Chatkora, Murgh Makhni, Amritsari Kulcha, and Lassi!  Very active staff and great service.  One of the best North Indian food in and around HSR. A must visit if you live nearby.  Will definitely visit again."
5.0,Very tasty food ! Must try Dal makhni and panneer tikka and garlic kulcha courteous staff. Place may not be that fancy but food is beyond yummy !
1.0,ordered mutton curry and rotis. When we were almost done and had reached our last roti we saw two small dead cockroache's in the roti basket. when we called the manager and adressed the issue in response he said it will never happen again and offered us some desserts as a token of sorry. Seriously? thats all? We then left and he took the whole amount from us and we couldn't say anything as the mutton was clean apparently and he convinced was that it was a genuine mistake. We shall never visit them again and would suggest everyone not to visit as their kitchen is dirty and the quality is bad for sure.
3.0,Super duper spicy food. Food delivered was not same as ordered. No complimentary as written on the bill.
1.0,chicken was half cooked no taste at all
5.0,very nicely packed. wholesome food with perfect quantity.
5.0,everyday I am falling love with this food.
3.0,didn't get complimentary gulabjamun.
5.0,awesome food as always.
5.0,"Good food ,same as I am expecting and a food was in time"
4.0,"If you are looking for authentic taste of home cooked Punjabi food, look no further. Run by a Punjabi family of food connoisseurs, ZMP has a very homely ambience and friendly staff. Mr. A P Singh who runs the place takes personal interest in your order and feedback on how you liked the food. Our favorites were their Chatpata Paneer Tikka, a veg starter with a mix of meetha and khatta flavors of spices, and the Amritsari Kulcha, a soft kulcha baked with a generous stuffing of grated vegetables and flavored spices. The Lassi Halkee Phulkee and Gur kee Lassi are the other must-haves.. A yummy experience, overall. Will be back for more Punjabi treats at ZMP, especially their renowned Gulab Jamuns !"
4.0,They cook delicious food both veg and non veg.I always order from this place whenever I crave some delicious pocket friendly food.The only con I ever faced is the packaging whenever i order online.
5.0,good
3.0,Very spicy although specially requested for mild spice
2.0,very disappointed with the quality of food.
4.0,Awesome like always
2.0,"We had ordered CK47 and was told it's spicy, but it was more like a Aachari chicken which was tasting like a pickle, starter's were average, the ambience is fine but should be manitained."
4.0,"We visited here 2 times and ordered food once. They live upto the expectations all the time. The service is fantastic. Once when we ordered, the owner him self came to deliver. The main highlight of the place is the food. they are specialist in North indian food and the taste is great. The place is full specially during weekends but waiting time is not much."
3.0,Any dish with potato needs improvement... Last time it was ALOO papadi this time ALOO Gobi... But paneer dish or chicken dish are amazing
5.0,Pure Punjabi Taste. Varieties of Paneer Tikka is good for vegetarians. Quantity is good for two people. Reminds of me childhood punjabi restaurants we used to visit with family when eating out was a luxury.
4.0,chicken was amazing.... could improve on the raita and mint chutney for chicken was literally 2 teaspoons .  a little more is always required for a while portion on chicken.. rest everything was good..
5.0,"I ordered the food from here, and it was delivered fresh and hot! Delicious food.. Especially loved the paneer makhanwala.. Will definitely order more from here or visit the restaurant in person :)"
2.0,delayed by 40 mins
4.0,In love with your food. Considering the available options in HSR layout I would prefer ZMP as the food is good but the only issue is the location as this fails to remind me of the outlet and every time I land up at a different outlet.
3.0,"Butter chicken was terrible!  Considering we ordered it to feed a family of Punjabis, we were highly disappointed! It was over spicy and masaledar with capsicum and tomatoes in it... not recommended at all :( :( :(   Edit as of March 5th: the owner called me himself to apologise for the fact that our orders were mixed up - I got the chicken tikka masala (which made more sense in retrospect!) and my butter chicken reached another person. I would definitely give them a second chance... it was a genuine mixup and the owner was genuinely interested in keeping the clientele happy. Thanks for the efforts, Mr Sumit!!! :)"
4.0,"For some good punjabi food..this is the place. The restaurant is on the roof top, though you won't get the feel much as it is covered completely on all sides. The service is a bit slow. You have to wait quite for sometime for both the starters and main course. I have been to the restaurant twice and have never been disappointed with the food. So I think it's worth the wait. We had ordered chicken chatkora for starters. Half plate has good 6 pieces to offer. Very well marinated as mentioned in the menu and has very good flavors, served with onions and pudina chutney. For main course we had murg kalimirch, egg rice and amritsari kulcha. Everything tasted yummy. Murg kalimirch had the perfect amount of spices and you can eat it with kulcha /roti. The amritsari kulcha had a good amount of stuffing to fill you up. The egg rice was different in a good way. It was a blend of Biryani rice I feel with egg bhurji in it. I liked it a lot. I wouldn't mind visiting this place again for the amazing punjabi food that they offer."
4.0,"We have visited this place and the food is just too good. Its authentic punjabi dhaba food, which is rare in Bangalore. We ordered dal tadka, mushroom sabji, phulka and tandoori roti. After so long, I have tasted such ausumn daal. Mushroom was bit spicy but its a treat for your taste buds. Will definitely recommend this place for dhaba food"
1.0,unbelievably spicy. had to throw the chicken away
1.0,curry was not properly packed.. it came out ..there was no gravy.. it was dry..very worst parcel I have seen ever
3.5,"For simple and tasty food don't think twice to go here. Usually there is waiting time during dinner hours so plan accordingly, owner needs to increase seating capacity. They run out of many items on menu before time but overall food is descent."
5.0,"Tini Tiny Place for all the Punjabi Food you can gulp in. As always ordered Paneer Makhani and Daal Makhani, and the just the aroma of the food had our tastebuds tickling. Garlic Naan, Butter Naan and Aloo Cheese Parantha was what accompanied the dishes. Again garlic naan was treat. Although aloo cheese parantha can be missed here, nothing special. The food accompanied with great Punjabi Tracks in the background makes the dinner a huge memory junction for peeps.  Also the ZGold makes the food price go down tremendously, making us grin at every bite we have. Second Visit is on the card always."
4.0,Simply awesome
4.0,Started with Chicken Chatkora. Went on to the signature CK47 along with pudina lachcha paratha and naan. Closed with gur ki lassi. Topped it up with a paan which was conveniently available on the way out. Must say that everything was above expectations. It was an impromptu decision to visit this place. Must say that the waiter was very helpful in our order selection. Wanted to have ghevar rabdi too but did not have room for it. It will serve as a reason to visit this joint once again.
4.0,"Being closer to my office, it is our favorite pocket friendly destination for individual treats. Little hard to locate and then to climb up, but the taste and flavour covers up for everything. Must try - murg chatkora, bhatti ka murg, murg methi malai, garlic naan. Average - CK47, panner tikka, handi chicken. Let down - ZMP special murg, Ambience, Seating options, wash basin ;)"
3.0,I didnt get the complimentary Gulab Jamuns in the parcel :(
4.0,"Writing this review based on take away only.. havent visited the place to comment on the ambiance or service.. ordered twice here for seafood.. once we ordered Amritsari Fish the first time n second time it was chatpata fish tikka.. amritsari fish was pan fried basa with a spicy masala.. Fish tikka had a flavourful masala again on basa, accompaniments were green chutney and onions. I would order these again since I stay in BTM n there arent many places that serve good seafood."
4.5,Non veg starters were awesome. Gravy item was also good. Kulcha was also fantastic. Had shikanji after a very long time n it was ummmm delicious. Overall it was a fantastic lunch. Will visit again n will suggest my friends too
5.0,Food was very delicious.. we had ordered 2  starters .. murg Lal mirch and cheesy tang .. both had excellently marinated and flavours were very unique and tasty.. for main course we had choosen Ck 47 and phulkas.. very delicious.. phulkas were soft and served hot..
1.0,Didn't enjoy the Chicken at this restaurant. My experience at this restaurant was not in line with other Punjabi Restaurants. I went there looking at their menu which provided a lot of interesting options but the taste of their signature dish was such that I was not able to finish off the meal even after trying my hardest to do that.
5.0,A friend had recommended this place for Punjabi cuisine and we loved every thing about this place... Ambience and music was great... Food was outstanding and the service was remarkable... Gur ki lassi is a must try... Tried Aloo papad for the first time and it tasted great... Chicken butter masala and Tara ghost is a must try for nonveg lovers... Shall definitely visit again to try their other delicacies...
4.5,"If you are a punjabi food lover there you go. They have humble staff and food that satisfies all cravings for north indian cuisine. Rara chicken, murgh malai tikka and roohafzah shikanji are exceptionally good."
5.0,"Best food with best price... Every penny worth it... Affordable cost n best quality ever had. Finally food a good restaurant that serves food with authentic Punjabi north food. All restaurants just quote north food but they can't even get near to North food. This place is just perfect with amazing chicken dishes, superb daal tadka, fresh hot, fulkas, fresh paneer sabjis. Have been here almost 10-12 times n even ordered food 7-8times. Every time I fall in love with the food. Hence giving good rating n recommending...must try yourself"
3.0,"This is a perfect family place. No drinks no loud music just some good food and lots of talks with your folks. Ambience of this place is good loacted on 5th floor with covered rooftop seatings. Service gets delayed on peak hours, you might have to wait a bit for your order. Staff is friendly. I would say food is good. I ordered chicken starter, was not good. Also, fish tikka had more of masala than required. Non veg main course is good. Vegetarian will have a good time here as they make good veg dishes. Location - 5 Ambience - 5 Value for money - 4.5 Service - 4 Hygiene - 5 Cuisine - 3"
5.0,"Superb Service / friendly staff The Food is really good, I specially like the chaatkora murgh,cheesy tikki, murgh makhani The ambience is very nice. Definitely recommend it!!!"
5.0,"Me n my hubby visited ZMP twice before... But we tasted only veg recipes.. So v planned for nonveg dinner on New year night...They had special on that day but the options were less.. We ordered #Peri peri Panner(it tasted tangy n spicy))must try starter #Tangdee Kebab(4leg piece)Bit tangy n spicy aswell...it  was not too spicy..tatsed yummy#Special lassi(250ml)Thick beaten sweetened lassi topped with rose essence #Butter naan #Stuffed naan #CK47 gravy(Onion tomato gravy with less spicy consisted of 5 medium sized chicken pieces)Best choice for Naan,roti too... And we also got compliment of 2scoopes of icecream as Newyear offer....Since we were too hungry we didn't click pics..."
1.0,there was one small piece of chicken in the gravy... bad food
4.0,"Go here for authentic Punjabi cuisine. Dal Makhani is on point, starters are good quantity and taste. The ambience is decent. It's a good place to dine out on a casual basis."
4.5,Almost perfect Punjabi food. Visited thrice already and like it everytime. Ambience is simple like you would find in a dhaba. Everything in food that i have tried has been good
3.5,"It's a decent place to have a meal without having to spend too much money. It's a Punjabi place so I wanted to give it a try.  Lassi could be much better, it felt more like having sweet curd than Lassi. So I would suggest to order the smaller one in case you want to try.  Butter chicken was decent. There were only four medium large pieces of chicken but for the price that's good enough.   Tandoori roti and Laccha parathas are OK. Nothing much to say about them.  Overall, worth visiting. A decent rating because food isn't too costly and seems value for money."
5.0,"Food delivered on time.  Peshawari kulcha Paneer lababdar  Peshawari paneer tikka Lazeez chetriyaan( mushroom)  Wow. All taste superb. After such a long time i loved everything specially paneer, its so soft fresh paneer and taste yum.  I didn't know paneer tikka can have so many variety also. I am going to try all for sure.  Price is little high but worth it.  Thanks for lovely taste."
5.0,"First of all, you can see the given rating and tell this is a review praising the meal (Butter Chicken/Murgh Makhani and steamed rice).  So may go ahead and do the order. But if wanne know why and the details, and the details of the curry which is what i really appreciated then go read down.    Now that being said I'll just say up ahead I'm a big fan of Butter Chicken (also called Murgh Makhani) and I'm more often disappointed then being really happy with what  I get on my plate.    This review is a long overdue review to this place because I've been coming here for some time and seen this place grow.    What I like about this butter chicken it doesn't let the sweetness or creaminess or spices dominate each other.  It maintains a really good balance and semblance of different spice/taste. And that is what butter chicken is about and not what many restaurant say  ""it is a Butter and tomato gravy"".    That being said this is not your usual Mughlai curry but more of Punjabi style.  But what I've learned that naming a curry in India is useless cause people sell same named curry with a different take on it.  And very rarely the take is good!  And this take on butter chicken is brilliant and one of the top 5 butter chickens I ever had.      PS: Generally, the best time to ever have a meal in any restaurant is some time after it opens and before its starts getting a lot of orders."
3.0,"Ambiance is not good, though this is not an ambience specific place. And staff is not very friendly. But they serve good food, almost authentic and alright. I have tried same items repeatedly, the taste varies. On some days it's just amazing, on the other day it's average. I hope you visit on a good day."
1.0,extremely oily curry made with daalda...Will give people heatt attack
4.0,Good customer service Had a problem with the order the owner sorted it out by himself and the food is good guys.... Authentic Punjabi.. Must
1.0,Am really disappointed with the quantity of the food served here.Earlier both quality and quantity were sufficient for the rate of the dish. Recently after renovation both are going downhill. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for a Punjabi cuisine
3.0,"Unnecessarily hyped. Nothing mind blowing about this place.  Converted a rooftop into a hall typed restaurant. Just hanging lights, No ambiance as such.  Service is pathetically slow. Had to tell the waiters quite a few.times to check on the orders.  The food is average. The starters were great. But the gravy smelt a little funny.  The lassi and the kulcha which come recommended are definitely something you should try.  Something I like about this place is that the owner comes by and talks to you.ans enquires about your food and experience. So that's nice."
5.0,"The food is amazing. But the best part is the response from the owner. Even if the order is place online, they will call and clarify if there is any doubt."
3.5,Food is good. Ambience is alsoo good..We tried sarson ka saag and makke ki roti..reallyy good man!... Overall the service is also good..A good place to hangout with friends! :)
1.0,"The food is not good. We ordered a paneer item and a chicken item, and both had the same gravy. The food was very spicy and oily . It completely lacked the taste. Disappointed!"
3.5,"Another Dhaba styled restaurant that serves authentic punjabi food. Zero mile Punjab is located in HSR layout on the 5th floor of a building so its little difficult to locate. We ordered tandoori murgh, paneer makhanwala , tandoor roti and kulcha . The tandoori murgh was spicy and good. Paneer makhanwala was just the perfect curry to tone down the spice level.  Overall it was a good experience. Would recommend it to those who wanna try Dhaba food for a change"
4.5,"Truly holds to its name, Zero Mile Punjab. Restaurant serves awesome punjabi cuisine. One can only feel being in punjab, while having the food. Great restaurant for some good hot and spicy food. Price is reasonable and competitive for the quality of food served. Ambiance is good overall. Parathas, a must try.  Food - 5/5 Ambiance - 4/5 Cleanliness and hygiene -4.5/5 Service - 4.5/5"
4.5,Good place for foodieezzz...bendi fry is an must try dish....and all the porotas are owsome ....but environment is ok ok...... service in nice.... price are affordable ....
4.0,"Simple and authentic punjabi food, being a punjabi i love to visit this place on regular intervals. My personal favourites are tandoori murgh, murgh chatkora and dal makhani. Ambience is simple but taste is awesome."
4.5,Awesome food and ambience. A must visit. Chicken chatkora and chicken should be in the order. A proper Punjab type feeling.Road side dhaba in HSR
5.0,Ultimate food at best price. Must visit for those who like north indian pure punjabi kind of food. Best part is ... Owner keep himself in kitchen not on the money collection desk to give best quality food to the visitors.
4.0,"Food is fine with satisfactory punjabi taste and delicious deserts. Ambiance is awesome a terrace turned into restorent with deco giving feel of north. Playlist is good, added with punjabi beats. Felt little over priced but still worth going once!"
4.0,"Food is delicious...more of spicy Ambience is good, and music jus awesome Service s a bit slow Can go vth family friend.... Panner tikka is toooo good"
4.5,"Basic looking place. No fancy touch but the 3 key things of this place are - Quality of Service, Great food & Value for money. If the ambiance is taken care of a bit more it will be a 5 star place for me."
1.0,Food was of average quality and didn't find it self satisfying after getting it order from a Punjabi restaurant .Authentic taste was void and could have been better .  Disappointing being a food lover .
1.0,This is for zomato food was good
4.0,"My visit was quite interesting one. We met the owner on our way to the restaurant, who was quite courteous to let us take the lift inspite of he was waiting beforehand. The ambiance was not that great. Few minutes after we took a took, we heard a customer sreaming and complaining about the quality of food which went on for good 10 mins and during this while we were just watching as audience. It ended up when the owner acknowledge his mistake and replaced the item. Soon after same issue happened on other table, by now we were giving a serious thought of whether we should go to a different place, but after some discussion we went ahead with the same place. Being little scared we didn't ordered much, but to our surprise and contrary to other table (with issues) the food was awesome. And the taste reminded me of the one you get on the Delhi Highway dhabas. This gave us the confidence to order more. The owner worked relentlessly to make sure that other customers are happy with the quality.  Not sure if we were lucky but I would recommend to visit this place."
5.0,It's a fab place for those looking for authentic north indian punjabi type ka food. Friendly on pocket. Delightful on tummy. Must visit place. You visit once n would love to have a bite at least one more time. Thali options are awesome too.
5.0,Eat very good Punjabi food Sunday  A must visit place for all non-veg lovers..the place is usually jam packed during weekend and you'll have to wait for sometime before getting your food...   Must try items   1. Chatkora Murgh 2. Mutton Sheek Kabab 3. Cheesy Tikki 4. Amritsari Fish  I'm definitely visit again. ...
5.0,"No other best place in Bangalore for proper tasty food!!!!! It's THE best!!! 5 star rating for food!  If you are looking for tasty food, do visit. Veg or non-veg everything in the menu is superb! Right and absolute flavour and taste.  Don't go for ambience and facilities... It's only food at reasonable price...  I request ZMP, please please please don't change your location and your awesome cook and price... just stay the same .. love it!!!"
5.0,"Lovely rooftop place, really good food too. Very courteous staff and extremely polite owners. I've been here twice and loved everything from chicken malai tikka to panner methi malai to rara murgh and not to forget their lassi and butter milk. Don't miss it."
3.0,"We were out to have dinner at Punjabi Rasoi but we got lost and ended up here. When we reached we thought that we gonna waste our time here because the locality is so dark and silent, kind of deserted type. But when we actually enerted it was totally different experience. Very loud Hindi music with lot of people sitting and having dinner. We reached late so got a table quickly. They have quite a big variety of Punjabi cuisine available. We got one Medium lassi, One lachha parrota, one Amritsari Kulcha, one Murg Chatkora and one Handi Murg. Murg Chatkora was very good in taste while Chicken Handi was bland and just too much spicy. Chicken and the spices didn't mix only. Lassi was up to the mark. There was nothing special about the Lachha parrota and Kulcha. Recommended for HSR people who are searching for good Punjabi style food. But lunch would be little sweaty I guess because the place doesn't have air conditioning."
4.5,"The food is really good, I specially like the paneer do pyaza, shikanji. The ambience is very nice, with music playing in background give feeling you are in dhabha. The staff is courteous and friendly. Definitely recommend it!"
5.0,"Great quantity, great taste!"
2.0,Ambience ( 3/5) : When we went to eat there which was around June...the place did not look like a rooftop restaurant to me at all....I couldn't see even an inch of sky so was really disappointed...  Food (3/5) : Food is ok ok....Not something that I haven't tasted before...  Price is average...  Service (0.5/5) : I saved this for the last...the waiter confused our order and got us extra curry....he kept complaining that it was us who ordered instead of accepting that he might be at fault... finally we got angry n told them to keep it as it was impossible to eat so much... However they charged us for that... Even the owner was adamant and kept defending the waiter....This is not the way to treat a customer....if we are paying for so much food why on earth would be we lie about one dish...we didn't even touch the dish...the least you could have done us not charge it...Just because of this behavior I would never look forward to going to this place again...
4.0,Have visited this place a lot of times... Great punjabi taste... In starters murgh chatkora is their specialty and a must try... While ordering dishes marked spicy...be prepared for runny nose but worth a try... Gulab jaamun are the best here and offcoz the lassi in jar....little bit bettering the hygiene in facilities will surely up the rating...
4.5,"One of the best place to get the taste of home like food, never fails to impress me with the bud filling taste and swift service . My ultimate fav being the Dal Tadka. The non veggies are also a must try with the. Right blend of spices. If you are searching for a sharp dhaba style desi food, recommended to the highest degree"
5.0,Amazing food. Proper north indian family dining restaurant. Good ambience. Affordable price.. a must visit in hsr layout.  Must try their pindi choley thali...  You have to ask for their thali menu which is different from their conventional menu..
3.5,"We ordered malai tikka, tandoori, lassi, butter chicken and naan. All items were fresh, hot and decently tasty. No ambience. Can go for a casual eat."
4.5,Excellent food. We loved the various tikkas that we had ordered. Their breads are amazing as well.  The staff are well informed and have a clear idea on how each dish tastes. Good experience! Just need to update the ambience.
3.0,"I have been to this place multiple times but lately I have stopped enjoying this place because they have started screwing up some dishes which I used to like here. I have  tried lot from their menu starting with different types of appetizers like paneer tikkas, achari mushroom, tandoori chicken (tried by my brother and did not enjoy because of extra oil). In the main course I have tried kadai paneer, dal makhani, dal tadka, paneer makhanwala and Mushroom punjabi. They used to have ajwain prantha on the menu earlier but I don't see it anymore. So all the items that I talked about were good but lately I had a very bad experience when I dragged my office friends with me to this place. They messed up dal tadka badly and they screwed kadai paneer like anything and the explanation was that I asked for less spicy food. How can you mess up the taste of the food by just saying that it was ordered less spicy. I am still giving it 3.0 because I had some good experiences at this place earlier. This place is at the rooftop and had ample street parking in front of it. Service can definitely be improved at this place because I had some goof ups in my order at this place. It's been while I went back to check on this place so I might have to change my rating too. However with my last experience and with extra extra oil in my food, I cannot rate it more than 3.0. This is definitely not a good dine in restaurant because it gives you a feel of a dhaba but their prices are on the higher side considering their dine in environment. I would recommend others to give it a shot and please comment on my review if you find it different than what you observe."
3.5,One of those good places where even the vegetations have a lot of good items to select from. We went for a team lunch and were also given a discount of 8%  The place is easy to locate and open air. Lunch could be a problem since there is no ac. The service is nice. The lassi is out of the world.  The murgh lasooni and pyari pyari tikka seemed more delicious than most of the non veg starters i had.  There is an item called mirchi paratha which had the correct amount of red chilly. The other food items are all moderate and nothing disappointed me.   Except for the fact that dessert section had a lot of items that were unavailable. Pocket friendly and nice place for people around HSR
2.0,Had hell of a time after having food here. Experienced worst stomach upset of my life. Kadai veg had no flavor just some veggies boiled and mixed with onion and tomato. Worst experience ever.
4.0,"A typical flavour of Desi Mini Punjab - Loved it  lookin fr a place to dine ended up at Zero Mile Punjab wid my bro Vinit Kantrod  Must say the food is hell good & the place is simply calm wid good music around. A proper place to hangout wid friends & colleagues.  Ordered Murg Chatkora & tandoori in starters, wereas der 1 maincourse has a name CK 47 (cmes frm AK47). The dish is a killer if u hav it wid garlic kultcha. The staff r friendly & Sonu paaji, thnks fr d ser  Wld recomend all #foodie to visit here & taste amngst 1 f d best punjabi food in #Bangalore"
2.0,"The loud music here will give u headache.   If u can live with that, then let's talk about food and service.   Lassi: nothing but curd and sugar. Which is probably prepared in morning and kept in refrigerator. And yes for that it is over priced. You can sense the taste of other dishes in that lassi that might have been kept in fridge.   Amritsari kulcha: it was good.   Paneer methi malayi:  Yes this is the only thing i liked here.  Babycorn punjabi: dude... Just few babycorn and lots of over spicy gravy. I didn't pay for that gravy, i paid for babycorn. Not something i can say i liked.   Tawa roti/fulka: eat before it gets cold. You will have to tire your mouth to chew it later. And when you are charging Rs. 5 extra for butter per roti, atleast apply butter properly. I mean, don't go down that much.   Now, to the music. Who likes so loud music during dinner??  As i entered the restro, i requested twice to the staff to reduce the volume. Yes they did. But after 5 mins it was again at its peak shrill volume.   Conclusion: i am not even going to look at this restro in future."
4.0,"We went there on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch. The food is great but the we felt that the service is very slow. The starters be it chicken tikka or Amritsari fish were very tasty and just upto the mark. I wish the quantity was a little more.  For main course we had butter chicken, fish tikka and CK47 which turned out to be very tasty and the chicken was soft and juicy. The naans were a bit leathery but the Garlic Kulchas were out of the world! Lassi was also thick and tasty! A must visit. Just try to improve your service:)"
2.0,Not very good food and the service was dull too. Overpriced for the quality of food and service they provide. Drinks they served were horrible in taste. Hugely Disappointed.
3.0,Not the place for vegetarians I guess.... since we visited on a festival we stuck to veg food and were not really impressed Had the cheesy tikki which was passable- given that it was promoted as days special.... not what I was expecting  The bhindi do pyaaza was oily and had loads of green chillies  The dal fry and dal makhani were good Nothing much to talk home about the naan and paneer malai tikka
4.0,The restaurant is very easy to find with the name flashing at the top.   The ambience is perfect as neither is it overdone nor is it too flashy. It's a great attempt art capturing the essence of punjab. With apt music and seating arrangement. The food is good. Specially the Shikanji. Will visit again.
4.0,Great food at great prize.. I loved the home made daal fry n almost all chicken starters are worth the prize.. it was my second visit to this place and was not disappointed to spend good quality dinner time here.
4.0,One of my favs.. definitely must visit for the super yummy punjabi chatkara... paranthas..lassi.. paneer...chicken malai.. everything is just perfect.  Can't stop myself from ZMP binge. Chakk de Fatte!!
4.0,"Ordered paneer do pyaza with naan along with shikanjvee. My friends also ordered sultani alloo which you should try because they are yummy. They did reduce their quantity now since the last time I went but I still loved the place. The food was perfect, not much spicy and I ended up eating much more than I expected. Service was little bit slow but we can overlook it if food is so well cooked and taste so good. Looking forward to my next visit there :)"
3.5,This is one of the best place to order food or visit. Very simple ambiance but delicious food at pocket friendly price.   Definitely worth a try!
3.5,"Loved the paneer tikka masala and laccha paratha. The service is not so friendly. And it seems like home deliver and takeaway is not a good option here, as the food doesn't taste that great as it dose while dinning in."
4.5,"Awesome food.. From masala papad to chicken everything was up to mark. I went here with my colleagues and we ordered sultani aloo,butter milk, lassi, masala papad, butter roti, kulcha, plain roti, and some chicken(spicy and not listed in the menu). Chicken was very well prepared. Dripping butter from the roti and the kulcha, super oily chicken, thick lassi is what you will get here (punjabi cuisine afterall). Give it a try if you are looking for some good punjabi place."
3.0,"We ordered tandoori ,not tht authentic flavours,extra masala ,don't like. Their zmp special chicken starter is good. In main course we ordered zmp chicken wch is again good but masala is very much . Not tht authentic . Found Punjabi rasoi better than this."
3.5,Taste is really good but very spicy and rich. We had very good time here however the gravies were too spicy that we could not complete. Lassi is not what we have expected.
4.0,"Nice Cozy place on the top floor, authentic Punjabi food. Dal was good, so was paneer tikka. Decent portion size. Courteous staff. Keep up the good job."
4.0,Delicious food both veg and non veg.Their Amritsari Kulchas are as soft as cotton and tastiest Kulcha I ever had in Bangalore.BHATTI KA MURGH is tasty that u can feel the taste every marinating ingredient. Best pocket friendly place in HSR.
3.0,Average Food. If you have high expectations than should not opt this one.  Good Ambience. Poor Selection of Songs. Some Punjabi Music would make the Ambience much better.  Try Special of the day. It seems you get good taste amongst that only.
4.5,Craving for good North Indian? This is best place to go. Must try- lazeez paneer tikka.  Ambience is 3 Food- 4.5 Money value - 4  Must try their 'Today's special' menu. Ice-cream with gulab jamun is for sweet tooth
4.0,"I visited here last week. While staying in HSR Layout if I feel to have Punjabi food, I was going to Punjabi Rasoi (Punjabi Rasoi Indira Nagar is much better than HSR Layout wala.). I guess after visiting Zero Mile Punjab I will never go to Punjabi rasoi. The food was very good. I tried Malai kofta, Punjabi paneer tikka, Achari Bhindi and Dal Makni. Everything was up to the mark. I had some Non-Vegetarianfriends with me who liked Bhuna Murg and Murg Chatkora. Food quality is much better then any other Punjabirestaurant in HSR Layout. Little expensive but worth trying once."
5.0,Excellent food Starter paneer was more ketchup Chicken and chole were lip smacking  Parathas were outstanding  Juices were ok Mushroom starter was very interesting
4.5,"Great food...Murgh Chatkora was really awesome, a must try. All dishes served hot and no complaints over taste ava service. However, it is not your kind of place, if you are looking a dining experience in terms of ambience. Strictly for people who want to enjoy tasty food, without worried about the dining ambience."
4.5,"One of the best places to treat your taste buds. Zero mile punjab...hsr layout  Starting from Kastoori Paneer Tikka to Dal Makhni to the breads, everything was so freshly prepared and tasted so good. The Services, the setup, the dhaba style ambience were 10/10...."
1.0,"They should remove 'Punjab' from the restaurant name, 'zero mile' is the apt name. 'Zero mile khane mein' .To food I would give an absolute zero, never had worse dal makhani than what they serve here. They should understand that dal makhani is not dal tadka. Initially it was as sweet as a gujrati dal, later upon complaining they made it like dal tadka. No texture, no consistency of flavors. Looks like the chef or owner has never been to Punjab or never tasted the authentic dal makhani. Bad food, bad service. Thanks ""ZERO MILE"" for our first and last visit."
5.0,"If there was a rating above 5, I would have given that to Zero Mile Punjab.. If you are craving for some old north Indian authentic Punjabi food, this is the place for you.. If food matters more for you than the ambience, this is the place for you.. If you like your meals hearty...butter soaked, in huge portions, this is the place for you....Top things about this place - authentic Punjabi food, huge quantities, and Taste is so finger-lickinggood it reminds you of Amritsar... best Punjabi food I have in all my years in Bangalore... I simply fell in love with the Rada Murgh.. and i am a vegetarian :P"
1.5,"Have visited twice, on new yr and yday. We had ordered some starters, malai kofta, garlic naan and lachchha parathain 1st visit. Starters were just ok, not how would you expect these to be in a decent restaurant. Kofta and gravy were not great either. Nothing fancy in gravy, very oily with lots of onion no cream no dry fruits.. The kulcha was simply superb bur that was the only item which could be appreciated.  Still as this place is always v crowded, we visited again yday and ordered paneer tikka masala with some rice and tandoori roti. Paneer tikka masala  Was just onion tomato curry with paneer squares along with few capsicum and tomato pcs. The veggies and paneer were not grilled as you would expect for paneet tikka masala and the gravy was too disappointing. My worst PTM ever.  Visit only if you are a big fan of very oily onion tomato gravy and dont yarn for fancy gravies. I am certainly not going there again."
4.5,Nice food...worth for money...not a very gr8 ambience but in the end food is the most important and this place does not disappoint. Definitely I would revisit this plc..
4.5,Best Punjabi food I ever had. Affordable prices. Please try lassi and kulfi. I would also suggest to try Mango paneer dish & malai kofta. Aaaaahhhhh bhartiya khana
5.0,Superb service /the place is lovely  Great food  What else one ask for?  Specially when you can eat everything on the menu for some 800 bucks?  Good food and service
3.5,We ordered from this restaurant thrice & had different experiences each time 'round The murg makhani is delicious but I'd give the chicken tikka masala a miss. The rotis came hot twice and cold the last time but the paneer parantha was to die for Would suggest consistency in food but will order again for sure :)
4.5,"One of the popular restaurant in hSr layout sector 6 for punjabi food.. Awesome green with new style dhaba looks.. Service is slow.. food was good.. must try dal makhni, chissy tikki....."
4.5,"Sabzi gravy wasn't good at all, specially paneer was very hard and didn't seem to be fresh. When you order paneer sabzi then paneer is main ingredient thus it should be nice and fresh. Phulkas were over loaded with butter.  Gulab jamuns were nice and soft"
3.5,"It was an impromptu decision to visit this place... Loved the decor and the rustic ambience... Ordered paneer Malai kabab, murg banjaara Kabab, naan and murg lababdaar... The starters were simply awesome... Especially the banjaara Kabab...juicy, succulent and full of spices in every bite...simply loved it... Murg lababdaar was spicy for my liking...didn't like that too much...overall a good restaurant for mid budget outing..."
3.0,"Went here after looking out for Punjabi food and with a 4.0 rating, I did try their signature dishes but was not very pleased with the taste. Ambience is good but location of this place is very bad."
4.0,"This is hard to find with a small poster on 5th floor. Nice ambiance with rooftop; seemed like normal restaurant, hard to find any difference at night.  Tasty food items you may try: Mango/sweet lassi, Murgh chatkora, Paneer kastoori tikka on starter Murg methi malai, Murgh tikka masala on main course and Pan flavored kulfi on dessert.  Supportive staffs. Competitive price. Nice songs playlist. Overall nice restaurant. Must try for Punjabi foods."
5.0,An awesome place for punjabi style food. Amritsari kulcha & buttermilk was awesome with delicious taste of kadai panner & chicken adraki. Taste is awesome here.  Waiting to visit again very soon.
1.0,For a change me and wife planned to have Indian food. I am not one who used to write reviews but this experience did compelled me to do the same. It was not at all a pleasing experience. We tried cottage cheese some less spicy indian curry. curry was just fantastic but the heart of the dish was very hard something quite stale. i am not a kind of person who would liuke to complain but this really disappointed me. sorry probably no more visit here.
3.0,"I have been to this place a couple of times..this time we ordered tandoori murgh n kalmi kebab.. which was served extremely late with exactly same taste. The staff is lil lousy , Amritsari kulcha was good but recommended butter chicken wasn't worth it. Service is slow."
4.0,"No kidding, this roof top dhaba has some seriously delicious Indian food to offer. Very well priced and very quick service. The place was packed when we visited for dinner over the weekend. Non vegetarians will not be given a chance to complain. Very good food on offer. Definately worth going back to, over and over again."
4.0,The food is wonderful. Ambience is like dhaba.  Come here is you want great Punjabi food.   We ordered tangadi kabab. It was yum and tender. They also serve tawa roti so you are not forced to eat big tandoori roti or naan.
5.0,"One fine rainy day I felt like having Paratha ,and what an amazing cheese n potato filled Paratha it was. But it was the lassi which took my heart away ,a absolute must have in zero mile Punjab."
1.0,"Had ordered food for home delivery yesterday..and it felt like a total waste of money!! There was too much oil in everything, so much so that it leaked out of one of the containers and every container I touched post that was covered in oil completely.  We had ordered two gravies veg kofta and paneer punjabi along with some breads. The kofta was fine but the paneer was tasteless and smelt really bad. It was clear that it was stale food and we had to throw it away. The parathas were also very thick.  All in all, not trying this place again!!"
5.0,"Brings you to Punjab.. Full punjabi ambience, authentic Punjabi food with loads of Butter.. Had amritsari kulcha, dal makhani and murgh peshawari. Also had the day's special Starter. Only thing that didnt go well was the Roohafza Shikanjee.."
3.5,"my friend suggested me ,,, love dto have some of the northi dishes.... starter came little late but the taste was good. I totally loved it . .., with correct spice and cheese. It was delicious and juicy and different from anything I have ever tasted. For the main course we went for Amritsari Kulcha (must try) and Peshwari murgh. the specials of the day will be an advantage..... thanks all team..."
1.0,"Had went recently on a rainy Wednesday for a dinner. We ordered Sultani sheek, Bhuna murgh, Amritsar  kulcha. The sheek was just okay. Bhuna murgh was hopeless, the chicken was not cooked properly , just boiled and then added into the marsala. The flavor of the gravy wasn't there at all in the chicken. It was pathetic. The kulcha OMG was overloaded with che/oil. Honestly I soaked the oil with 4 tissues pieces.   Coming to other factors. The place was drowning dive it was raining. And a staff I guess he is very young I am just hoping he is above 18 was sweeping the floor with a wiper . But the stick of the wiper was just half the normal length, so this was literately struggling as his back was aching. Of course what do you expect if you have to wipe the floor with a half length wiper fit more than 30 minutes. On talking to the boy, he told the owner doesn't hear to him. I request the owner to get a good wiper and show some respect to your staff and please don't fire him !!!  The washbasin is like a maze hunt, finally you find the washbasin but no tissues kept there. And if you have wipe your hand you will have to walk back to the table. So either some tissues or if you are eco friendly  please get a drier."
4.5,"Excellent food , decent pricing, authentic punjabi food. Ambience isnt that great but doesn't matter, the food is amazingly yummy. Service was quick."
2.0,Slow service and the food taste was below average. Not satisfied with the restaurant.  Paneer tikka was average but main course wasn't good at all.
3.5,"Ok, this was our much awaited outing to this place, so finally another Punjabi outlet to try. We went on a weekday so there was no crowd and we were served well. We ordered Lassi - this came in a unique styled glass, and since I am an ardent fan of lassi had lot of expectations but was disappointed, since it had that rose flavour inside and had to return it 1/5 Shikanji and butter milk - tasted great without any Fuss 4/5 Veg gilafi seekh - this was a great item and green chutney complimented it really well 4.5/5 Malai kofta - they were different but have tasted better at other places 3/5 Pindi chole - tasted great and was the best items ordered till now here, spicy and great North style tangy flavour 4/5 Amritsari kulcha - it was well prepared 3.5/5 Laccha parantha - this was one of the best laccha parantha we had ever eaten. It was crisp, brown and prepared too well 5/5 After the success of laccha parantha I had to order aloo pyaaz parantha - it was again prepared really well, brown crisp and stuffed well 4/5 We had a great outing and the owner was kind enough to take our reviews on lassi. Suggested Patiala lassi in Sanjay Nagar"
4.0,I have been to this restaurant couple of times. I like their chicken starters. I didn't like malai chicken starter as it was totally bland in taste. Service is good but I felt the people who are working sometimes fail to understand our requirement. Must try place around HSR layout.
3.0,"I went to Zero Mile Punjab with Zero expectations. Food ordered was Punjabi paneer, Murgh makhani, Dal Tadka, Zeera rice and Tandoori roti. Food and ambience was ok but the worst part is that there was a foul smell of stale food in the restaurant."
5.0,"A note of Thanks -- I ordered few items for Home delivery through Zomato, the ordered gets confirmed and I waited to see the weather turned into heavy rainfall with lightnings and winds. As the time turned into 9:15 PM (delivery time), I got a call from the ZMP saying ""there is no sign of delivery boys and I would come myself to deliver the food"". The rain never stopped and Yes the food was delivered by owner himself after half an hour. This is a huge commitment towards customers. I personally want to Thanks him for keeping his promise."
4.5,"The one truly North Indian restaurant in Bangalore. Absolute delight for a Delhiite. Run by a Sardarji, this place is tough to find, but still there is huge waiting mostly. The food is superb and ambience is decent enough. Be it starters or main course Try anything over here and you won't be disappointed Do try there Shikanji!!"
4.5,"Definitely One of the best places in Bangalore to have mouth watering Punjabi Dishes. Located on 5th floor, the place offers a decent ambience with ample seating capacity. Punjabi songs in the background add more to the ambience. We started with Chicken Chatkora - it was damn awesome. Cheesy Aloo which was one of the item for the day was good too. Murgh Malai Tikka was awesome too.  In main course we had Butter chicken which was good and had Spicy Kukkad which was unique too. In , Amritsari Kulcha was great and heavy. Certainly a place to visit again."
2.5,What's the point of good food when the service is bad? Good food and good ambience.  But the experience with service was very bad. Waiter got confused and got one curry extra than ordered. Even the owner was not helpful and kept justifying the waiter instead of customers which was very bad on their part.
5.0,"Tried this out yesterday. Loved it! FOOD Truly amazing Punjabi food. Try out Punjabi Paneer, Paneer Tikka Masala For sure Breads: Ajwain Paratha, Lachha Paratha and Kulcha were amazing. Lassi. Truly wonderful  AMBIANCE Very laid back and relaxing  SERVICE Damn quick!"
5.0,"Great food , couteous staff , brilliant service, value for money. Pleasant rooftop seating with a punjabi dhaba kind of ambience. Highly recommended if you are looking for some nice authentic punjabi / north indian food"
4.0,"It rains and you look for a great place to have some brilliant North Indian punjabi food. And this time while browsing through Zomato, I figured out this restaurant at HSR Layout.  Decided for a takeaway. Located in the service lane (hardly a km from Silk Board), the area didn't seem to be posh. Went to the restaurant which is on the 5th floor, was amazed to see that the place was fully crowded with a huge crowd waiting outside. This speaks of the quality.  The Sardar uncle at the counter gave us optimistic view about the food :) We picked Chicken Chatkora in starter - this is their signature starter. Was juicy all around the chicken. Loved it.  Murg Makhani was great. The gravy was onion based though. The gravy of butter chicken is generally smooth and you don't mix onion in it. Well, liked the taste. No complains.  The roti items - Lachha Paratha and Butter Naan were also good. They were different and quite soft even after one hour.   Worth trying. Will visit them again soon."
4.0,"Authentic Punjabi restaurant. Must visit for Punjabi cuisine lovers. I am a regular at this place. Parathas are just wow. Starters fully live up to the expectation. Do try the day's specials. However, gravy items are aome times too much spicy so you need tell them accordingly. Great place indeed.."
3.5,"Been to this restaurant  on a  sunday evening..it was nearly full.... Ambiance 3/5 - its on roof top, ordinary seating furnitures and decor nothing fancy or worth wow....plus point the owner and good  music .. Food 3.5/5 - it seemed non veg is talk of  the town i  wasnt dissapointed with the veg  food i  ordered...we  went with dal makhani kadhai paneer amritsari kulcha...food was good.. Staff  3/5 - they are helpful for  sure..but if u like  a little cleanliness and hygiene freak than i  am not  sure..would appreciate a  little more clean dresses and cutlery here though.. All in all a decent place..just wondering why most of these typically so called punjabi places generally do not  have lungar wali daal or maa ki daal..hmm.."
4.0,"Those who love North Indian Cuisine, must try their food. The quantity and quality of food is impressive. Among vegetarian starters, Veg Gilafi Seekh is delicious. There are lot of Paneer variants to try. Paneer Punjabi is a recommendation if you like spicy curries.   The service is slightly slow though and the music, too loud. If you can tolerate the loud speakers for good food, go, go, go.   Food (Taste) - 4/5  Value/Money - 4/5  On my 'Visit Again' list - Yes"
4.5,"It was a quick decision that we are going to Zero Mile Punjab. This is located on roof top but it's covered completely. Ambiance is normal. Menu has lots of variety of food. We ordered al tadka,punjabi paneer,parathe and nan. The food was really tasty and mouth watering. Curry and dal was really full of spicy  flavor. Quantity and quality was really good. Will visit this place again very soon."
5.0,"One of the authentic Punjabi restaurant in bangalore according to me, every bite is heaven. Always finding a way to go there and enjoy the unique taste whatever they cook. My favourite place."
4.0,"Nice rooftop place , rustic Punjabi ambience . Excellent service even on Sunday evening with pocket friendly menu card. We ordered lasuni tikka which was outstanding, rest of the veg and non veg food was average. Overall a must visit place"
3.5,We decided to go here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was well covered. The ambience is ok and in consideration with the feel od Punjabi khana. The hot Sunday made rooftop very hot though. There are songs played on the speakers which are too loud for a afternoon lunch. We ordered a buttermilk and lassi for refreshments and a murgh Malai Tikka. The starter came very late but the taste was unbelievable. I totally loved it . There were four average size pieces with correct spice and cheese. It was delicious and juicy and different from anything I have ever tasted. For the main course we went for Amritsari Kulcha (must try) and Peshwari murgh. You can always check the specials of the day before ordering. We didn't find it much fascinating as the others things. The service is late and we had to wait a lot and actually nudge the waiter for our order in . The gravy is on spicy side and goes well with soft stuffed kulcha. You can never go empty stomachs from this place. You are always too full. Overall food was great though the heat of the day was a layback.                                             foodndestinations.com
4.0,"This place stands true to its name and you get a hint of punjabi taste in the food. Its located on the top floor next to bhagwati hospital and at times may be difficult for few people to find. The ambiance is kind of dhaba style but they lack punjabi music which can be added to the ambiance. Coming to food, combining our two visits we ordered tandoori Murg, Achari Bhindi,Tilwala paneer Tikka,Veg Gilafi Sheek, Kadhai Paneer, Murgh Punjabi Special and Murgh Tikka Masala with Lassi.  In terms of starter they serve the best starters in pure punjabi style with decent spice and chatkara. The Tandoori murg was well done to the taste and Tilwala Paneer was a surprise winner. Veg Gilafi sheek was great too and achari bhindi was just mind blowing.  When it comes to main course , they just lag little behind the starters though not much except Kadhai paneer. We don't know what happened and may be their chef was too tired was or may be absent minded but Kadhai paneer was just horrible and it was not kadhai paneer at all. Apart from the taste, the oil and masala's were not cooked properly and were kind of raw. We asked to change the paneer and they gave some item which were forget though it was edible.  Overall this place have some great food apart from the surprise event of Kadhai Paner. I wouln't recommend anyone to visit the restaurant almost near closing time as everyone in the restaurant except the owner hates your there and may be you will not get the taste of food you deserve.  Ambiance : 8 - Decent Dhaba kind. Food - 8 - Great Starters , good main course. Service - 8 - don't visit after 3:15 strictly."
5.0,"Its our favourite place to dine with good ambience. You get a desi dhaba feel, which is amazing when you crave for punjabi food! Food was so delicious and service was excellent. Over all a must visit place for the food lovers. And dont forget to try the breads at such good price."
5.0,Amazing food served by cheerful people. Definitely try their signature dish Chicken chatkora. The food they serve is mouth watering and the lassi is not to be missed.
1.0,"To sum it up in one word, 'bad'. Zomato you've got to check your ratings algorithm, cuz it's been scammed. No person in his right mind would give this place any more than 1.0. Bad food, small portions, dirty wash basin. Sad place."
3.5,Authentic spicy Punjabi flavors. Ambience not meant for a day meal for sure. Service is just average. Hygiene definitely needs improvement. Tandoori Roti with Dal and Buttermilk is a must at this place.
2.5,"The food was cold. Also, we had ordered Amritsar fish tikka and chicken Haryadi kabab which was not cooked properly. Had left both dishes as is."
3.5,"The house speciality like the chicken chatkora was flavorful. The fish tikka starter, chicken bhuna and mutton do pyaza are surely recommended. The restrooms however were a huge disappointment. Overall this place was worth the money and a satisfying meal."
4.5,I had ordered chicken chatkora and Amritsari Kulcha and I really enjoyed the food. Very good quality and very tasty..Please keep up the same taste and quality.. Planning to taste more items soon.
4.0,Loved the food here. Went here with my friend for dinner twice as the food was great. One of the best places around here that serves north Indian food. The service is a little slow though.
4.0,"Staff is polite, service is prompt, rooftop ambience is quite good, plays Bollywood/Punjabi numbers. Would recommend the amritsari fish, dal makhni and nan. Suggested drinks buttermilk and lassi. Value for money."
3.5,"Among the restaurants serving punjabi cuisine in/around HSR, we found their starters to be too good. They surge you on to a high in a jiffy. They have the right mix of key ingredients to give you the genuine punjabi experience. The main courses were a tad disappointing since we didn't find much difference between the gravies of the dishes that we ordered..they all seemed to have the same base.  The beverage options are good and tasty. Haven't tried their desserts though."
3.0,"Based on Zomato review, I visited zmp. Has high expectations based on the ratings on Zomato. The food was reasonable and tasty. The big disappointment was the place didn't look well maintained. The tables was not clean, the wash area was very bad and unclean. They also added service charge without my consent, eventhough by law that has to be voluntary. Overall I feel the place  needs improvement."
1.0,I don't know why this restaurant is hyped so much for it's taste.  Reading reviews went for dinner there and to my surprise food was no where close to okayish... Ordered : Shikanji ( was missing lemon flavor) Dahi kabab ( with raisins ... Seriously ? ) Chicken chatora ( sweet and worst  chicken starter we ever had) Paneer punjabi ( was ok) not awesome. May be my day was not good but definitely not going again.  Better places in HSR to have Punjabi food.
3.5,"Wanted to have economical Punjabi food so selected this place. Haryali kabab was OK, Punjabi chicken didn't disappoint us, it was full of Punjabi flavours also quantity was good. I loved azwaini paratha with chicken. Paratha was very well cooked, soft n crispy. Service is fast, ambience is just ok. All points for food."
4.5,Had a really great meal.. Order Malai tikka paneer and chicken peshawari.. Good food quality.. Tandoori roti was better than most of the joints.. Food was delicious and service was good.. Would really like to visit here to enjoy a sumptuous meal sometime in the near future..
5.0,"This place never stops to surprise you. every time i go to Zero Miles, I fall in love with it all over again. The food, the ambiance and the service. All are superb. Visited it a couple of days ago with friends, and ordered peshawari chicken, and paneer lahori along with breads and pudine ka paani. All the dishes were well cooked and served. The food here definitely takes you back to taste of Punjab."
4.5,"Pretty nice place for foodies. The staff is extremely polite, which sometimes is a problem. Nevertheless the food is really lip-smacking. Music is a bonus."
4.5,Good food. Awesome lassi and fish items. Veggies might not like so much of this place when compared to non-veggies. Worth for money. Being my favourite place near to office to have quick lunch or dinner
1.0,Worst punjabi khana.. Ordered punjabi mutton and chicken labradar.. Both were sweet and oily. They have opened with a dhaba theme but taste is nowhere like dhaba food. Also very expensive.
4.5,"This restaurant is situated on the rooftop.Quality and the taste of food is good.You will really like to savour most of its dishes.I generally like lassi , Roohafza shikanjee in drinks.In main course both veg and non vegetarian are awesome.Also prices are reasonable too compare to other restaurants in the Vicinity of HSR layout."
4.5,#Food : Good quality Punjab food with moderate price comparatively lesser than other restaurant of 4+ rating.  *Must try : 1. Chicken chatkora 2. Amritsari kulcha 3. Bhendi fry  I will rate 4.5 out of 5.  #Service : Higher to lower authority talks in very familiar way. Nice behavior and moderate speed.  I will rate 4 out of 5.  #Ambiences : Ambiences is okay not extravagant or cool or classy. It's nicely decorated.  I will rate 3.5 out of 5.  KUNDAN KUMAR
3.5,"Quite reasonably priced places. Had Amritsari kulcha, dahiwale aloo, bagare chawal with Desi ghee tadka dal. Overall taste was above average. Liked their pudina paani drink. But overall liked the place for it's rustic ambience. Worth a visit."
5.0,Ordered online via Zomato. Zomato f*d up delivery and owner himself delivered the order. Kudos to that! Food was delicious.Ordered paneer butter masala which was purely  a bliss!
5.0,Awesome Punjabi food - more famous for non veg but Paneer dishes are equally good. This restaurant is located on terrace and has nice open ambience. Service is quick too. Total value for money. Must try Paneer Tikka masala over here.
2.5,"This is a kind of rooftop place in a 4 storey building.   Ambience is okayish,  nothing like that punjab feeling But the service part is that they have courteous staff,  though food delivery takes time.   Food part is also not that great,  the punjabi flavours are missing.   Have tried chicken items but didnt find it much to my taste( which is full om spices and a proper blend of ingredient)  Though the drinks (of course non alcoholic )  is good.    Incase u r looking for a proper punjabi meal,  i would recommend u search further    Happy eating"
1.5,"Sir, please check orders. Laccha paratha does not mean mirchi paratha. Mutton is full of masala. Sorry sir, not happy and will not be ordering again."
4.5,Best of Punjabi food in the Silk board area....  The top floor desiii ambience and good music adds spice to the dishes...the perfect place for dinner for people searching for north indian spicy food in Bangalore... LASSI needs a special mention as it the most attractive part to me at the restaurant
4.0,"Excellent food. The chicken of the day was superb, spicy and succulent. The roti, Nan and paratha were just perfect. The only downers, lassi and the location, stench from the gutter across the road and the building which is not well maintained"
5.0,"Ambiance - 5/5 Service - 4/5 Variety - 4/5 Food - 5/5 Staff - 4/5 Value for money - 4/5 Overall, its a good place to dine at, I really enjoyed the food..."
5.0,This place is HSR gives you the most authentic north Indian/Punjabi food you can find in Bangalore. I have eaten here multiple times and it really reminds you of home food. Great place.
3.5,Starter items were good. Did not like the main course much. Ambience not good. Family resturant.  Do try the butter milk.  Worth visit once. Location not so good.
5.0,"Zero mile Punjab is one of the very few places in the city which actually strives to deliver authentic Punjabi cuisine and not just infuse a standard taste into an ordinary menu. The taste is the strongest feature of it's Punjabi culture, you would feel it in every bite. Very nice preparation, simplistic yet pleasing taste and of course a nice and light atmosphere makes this place a must visit, not just for those nearby but also those who really need a break from the usual offering that so called Punjabi restaurants claim to deliver."
3.0,Been here on a busy Sunday evening have to wait for table and seeing the crowd it just raised the bar of my expectations. It has not met them if has definitely not let me down too. Tried usual go to dishes nothing fancy and it was at par with Punjabi touch. Rooftop but packed which is little bit weird but food quality didn't let me bother about that. However service was bit on the slower end.
4.0,"Taste - 4 Ambience - 3 Service - 3 Value for Money - 3.5 Menu Variety - 4  A nice Punjabi restaurant in an around the place. The food is quite good. Although i feel their starters are way above their main course dishes. However it maybe one of those odd days, i wouldn't know. The manager of the place sits around to see all guest are treated good, so that's a plus point. They serve very good, both veg and nog veg dishes. U can feel the authenticity of the Punjabi cuisine in this place."
4.0,Awesome. I have been there with my family and just had veg platter. This platter is for 4 people so heads up. All items in platter were just awesome. A big thumb up to the team. I would definitely recommend this place and would love to go again to try out main course :P  Food --Awesome Ambiance -- Decent (Need to ignore smell coming from near by drainage) Service -- Excellent  ***** Recommended *****
1.0,Disaster place. Its food is not at all good. Staff is not at all professional. Unhygienic washrooms. Go at your own risk.   Waiters do not know how to serve food. Zero mile punjab is actually zero in most of the things and miles away from authentic food leave aside punjabi taste.
3.5,"Ordered peshawari murg in which chicken was really fresh, soft & properly cooked. Though paneer tikka was average. Lassi was yummiest. Felt a little bit pricy since many punjabi restaurants have been opened with best mouth watering food. Points given for lassi."
4.5,Small restaurant on the top floor with awesome tasty yummy food. Though it takes a while to get your food but it's worth it. This place will never disappoint you.
4.0,"Dhaba type ambiance located in the vicinity of HSR, Zero Mile Punjab delivers some serious mouth watery food. The starters are well cooked and the food is scrumptious. Only disappointment is the drinks section which have quantity but not quality. Lassi is an authentic dish from Punjab and unfortunately they messed it up. But overall, a must visit if you want a family restaurant without the hustle bustle of the city. Recommended for VFM food.   Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Ambiance - 3/5 VFM - 5/5"
4.5,"we went there with friends Casual dining.. Brace yourself for an occasional whiff from the sewage canal if the wind blows funny. Structural issue being the reason =it is a terrace, no wall to keep the smell out.. But then, once the steaming plates of rotis n chicken get to your table, you'd probably forget all about the whiff.  over all nice place good food good service. food-4/5 ambience-4./5 service-5/5"
3.0,"After the recommendation of a friend and with the craving to have authentic Punjabi home style food, we went to this place with great hopes, but they were shattered in a jiffy.    Since we were very hungry, without any delay we called the waiter and asked for the specialties on the menu.  He suggested Punjabi Paneer Tikka for starters. It was there, served on the table without a long wait. It was hot and every element was perfectly charred. There were quite good number of pieces, so kudos on the quantity quotient. It was served with a creamy onion salad, green chutney and ginger julienne on the top which was pretty nice. After setting such high expectations we moved onto the main course and that was when the graph dropped drastically.  We ordered Murgh Makhni (aka Butter Chicken as per the waiter) and Dal Makhni along with butter naan and lacha paratha. Even though we were not done with the starter, the waiter came and started serving without even taking our consent.  That could be ignored though. Without any delay, we were ready to indulge in the delicacies, but they were not at all as we expected them to be. There was a foul smell of some oil in both the gravies and even in the lacha paratha. The chicken didn't taste at all like butter chicken, even the masala and the chicken pieces were not blended together properly. Same goes for the dal, no flavour at all. And we ended up with some food left out, which wouldn't have been the case if the flavours weren't that bland. Along with that we ordered pudine ka paani which wasn't that good, but wasn't that bad as well. It was just mildly flavoured.  Not just the food, the service was even a bit disappointing. There wasn't any warmth in the way the waiters talk to you. To add to this when we asked the waiter to clear out the table, he collected all the used napkins and used bones and stuff in my place, as if he was in my face. Although the owner is quite courteous and a warm person and make you fell like being at home. Ambiance is also quite colourful and fresh giving a nice edge to this place. And they have a mix of old and new Bollywood beats playing all time.  This brings me to the rating for this place. So for,  Food - 3 VFM - 3.5 Service - 3 Ambiance - 3.5"
3.5,"Landed in Zero Mile Punjab after searching for a good dine-in restaurant in zomato after visiting a pets showroom in HSR Layout. As usual, we wanted to try something authentic and the 4.1 rating in zomato made this carnivorous family ;) more curious to visit the place.   I have this habit of checking the reviews in zomato before visiting a place. And that's for getting a glimpse of the items we should order. We usually don't get biased by other's review. We completely let the taste buds do the work rather than the brain lol. Also, we didn't knew what authentic Punjabi food tasted like, and had to explore that based on what this restaurant served us. Having said that, we felt this place should never be 2 rated (as done by some customer here). 4.1 from Zomato can be a fair rating if we are considering just the food. Overall food quality was good. We ordered Murgh Khandari Tikka (5/5), Paneer Rajasthani Tikka (4/5), Navratana Pulav (3/5), Butter Naan (4/5), Sweet Lassi (5/5) & ZMP Special Murgh (4/5).  The ambience is below average. The wash basin & the hand wash was not kept clean and was located in a very shabby place. The Salt & Pepper dispensers had curry spread all over it (that must be done by some customer). Plates and glasses were really clean though. With the price they are charging (1300/- is what we paid for two adults), management should've maintain the place well. I believe cleanliness has nothing to do with the price hotels charge, but still people tend to relate it. With that, I prefer to give overall rating as 3.5.  Food - 4 Service - 3.5 Ambience - 3 Hygiene - 2.5  Would definitely visit again to try other delicacies and would recommend the place to others."
3.5,Very nice ambience. Taste wise ok Not so good not so bad. Service is very nice. I tried 1 st tme with my family We were five on Sunday morning lunch not such crowdy.
4.0,"The place is very descent to have food and also being at the roof top, it seems far away from the bangalore traffic. The food is good but the place is always crowded and so there is some delay in service."
4.0,"Casual dining.. Brace yourself for an occasional whiff from the sewage canal if the wind blows funny. Structural issue being the reason =it is a terrace, no wall to keep the smell out.. But then, once the steaming plates of rotis n chicken get to your table, you'd probably forget all about the whiff.   Based on Zomato recommendations we went with the chakori chicken. It is tangy /spicy /sweet.. A bit of a complex melody in your mouth. Tried the malai panneer starter.. N what yummy creamy, non rubbery panneer... Though we relied completely on our waiter for the gravy recommendation and asked him to suggest two very different dishes, it finally tasted very similar (except one had capsicum in it). That minor glitch apart, all hunky dory."
4.5,"We have been to this place multiple times recently, and it has never disappointed us. We, living in HSR, wanted to eat at a North - Indian fare joint and we could not find any. Then came Zero Mile Punjab. The ambiance is ok - always bustling with people on weekends - and oh my - the food is nice.  Some of our favorites - Dal Makhni, Paneer Tikka Masala, Butter Naan, Ice Cream with Gulab Jamun etc. The price is reasonable and food quality good. I haven't yet tried any non vegetarian item yet. The service is also good - it is run by a Sikh family.  Altogether, good experiences until now, will keep coming here."
5.0,"The name, zero mile punjab, itself speaks for the food that they serve over here, typically Punjabi food with mind-blowing presentation and taste. It is a casual dining restaurant with elegant interiors, grey walls, warm lights and wooden furnishing.The staff is attentive and well trained. The menu too is enormous and exemplary. Zero mile Punjab delicacies like Chicken chaatkora, Sultani sheek, kastoori murgh tikka, tilwala paneer tikka, and mainC, Panjabi murgh,kheema murgh ,raadaa mugh Paneer methi malai , This outlet in hsr layout sector 6 is a place which one should visit at least once to have the best dinning experience.tasted out of the world Looking forward to revisit and try other dishes as well. Best of luck guys."
2.0,"Don't get fooled by the reviews the food is plain below average. Ordered Chicken Chatkora, Aloo Sultani, Amritsari Kofta, butter Naan and Aloo, Pyaaz Cheese paratha. The food had no salt in any of the items. Chatkora chicken was sweet it felt like they had picked chicken pieces from butter chicken and baked it in the tandoor, the Sultani Aloo - the stuffed potato was slightly uncooked, the naan was okay, the Amritsari Kofta was okay and the paratha was two plain parathas cooked separately and the the stuffing was spread in between these two plain parathas. The ambiance was average, value for money? Nah! Service below average. Highly disappointing!"
3.5,"Went with family for dinner. It is a roof top restaurant with not so good ambience. The ambience does not give the feel of what the name suggests. The songs, the mood, the staff everything was so cold but not Punjab definitely. The service was not up to the mark. Food was nice and tasty. Lassi was good. Had dilruba paneer tikka (day's special). It was very well cooked. Taste was perfect. In main course, we had Dal Desi ghee tadka and nawabi sabzi. Dal had a very unique taste. Very Good Taste. Nawabi Sabzi was not good. It was mixed vegetables in Creamy Sauce. Basically it was Beans in cream sauce. 80% of the vegetables in the curry was beans. Tandoori Roti was nice and crisp. Naan was very good. Lachcha Parantha was bad. It was Tawa Parantha and not Tandoori, least expected at a Punjabi Restaurant. The prices of all the dishes were reasonable. Overall an average restaurant. Visit this restaurant with no great expectations."
4.0,"Perched on the terrace of a 5 floor building in HSR, this restaurant for sure can provide you authentic Punjabi cuisine. It's open spacing and a dhaba like feeling will make you feel serene and more hungry!   Though the cleanliness and serving manner of their dishes isn't up to the mark, but their taste will balance your disappointment. Their Mutton Do pyaza and Amritsari Fish are really peculiar and delicious!   There is always room for improvement in terms of cleanliness and usage of less oil in preparation.   A great place for team lunches or get togethers, as it's light on the pocket!  Ambience: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Service : 3.5/5 Price: 4.5/5  Cheers!"
2.5,"NOT FOR VEGETARIANS! I am not sure why this restaurant has received such a high rating. I went there with my family today and found it lacking in all respects.  1. Ambiance (1/5) The first thing that hits you is the ambiance, or rather lack of it. Situated on a roof-top, it resembles a road-side joint without proper wash-room facility.  2. Food (2/5) I found food to be without any flavours - so much for having ""punjab"" in its name. We ordered vegetarian and almost all of the dishes were quite pathetic. BTW there are no soups in their menu. 3. Service (3/5) Service was okay. The staff is courteous and quick. However, they seem to lack proper organization - we ended up being served by 3 different waiters. They also don't provide finger wash at the tables, so we ended up navigating their store areas to wash our hands twice. 4. Prices (2/5) As you can check the menu above, the prices are not cheap at all. This would have been fine had service, food or ambiance would justify these prices. But it doesn't.  Overall, I recommend vegetarians and families to stay away from this restaurant. I found Pindi and Atithi to be better that are nearby and have the same price point."
4.0,Great food. Ambience not that good. Cost reasonable. Had to wait 15-20mins for the table for a weekend dinner. Service too slow had to miss my bus to their slow service and waiting.!
3.5,"I visited this place on 22Jan ,2017 after reading wonderful review about this ""Zero Mile Punjab"". This restaurant is located on rooftop ,the place is nice with lantern hanged on walls , wooden furniture .They have a gamut of dishes in paneer .We ordered ""Peshwari Paneer Tika"" it was good but not that great .We ordered ""Amritasri Kulcha"", ""Tandoor roti"" and ""Dal Makhani"". Dalmakhani was really good , Kulcha and Tandoor roti was also good. They don't have any egg curry and there is only one Egg fried rice . Overall good restaurant."
4.5,It rating speaks for itself... An amazing place to have great north indian food... I discovered it recently and would love to go back..the veg and non veg...all wr awesome... Do try their dal makhni and the gulab jamun... Thanks for the great dinner guys..
4.5,Awesome chicken tandoori items. I really liked this place and food. Chicken chatkora and chicken tandoori was great. Also had chicken tikka masala it was spicy and tasty.
2.5,Okayish place..!! The kulcha and naam was good but the starters n main course were lacking flavors.. There was nothing special about the ambience also..
4.5,Excellent service. We called to place our order on the last minute and they went out of their way to make sure it get delivered. And food was good too.
4.5,This place gets closest to North Indian cuisine. The ambiance is OKish type and looks better in the evenings. The staff is polite and so is the manager here. Murgh Malai Tikka and Tandoori Murgh are personal favorites. Do try out the Lassi and Amritsari Kulchas here. Enough seating capacity for small get together as well.
4.0,"Zero Mile Punjab, a relatively new place in the ever changing food landscape of HSR layout. The place is into pure North Indian cuisine with no offerings in Chinese and other items like most other restaurants. The starters here rule the menu and the main course is equally good. Must try is Tandoori Chicken and Paneer Kastoori Tikka. The Amritsari Kulcha is pretty close to authentic. Do end your meal with the Ice Cream and Gulab Jamun which is served in a large size cup. Service is a tad slower but is acceptable up to a limit. Overall a very good place to dine with family. The place is kid friendly however the waiting can be irritating on weekends because there isn't much place for queue waiting which is something they can look at. The washing area needs improvement."
1.0,I have orders chicken peshwari and veg Kadhai last friday. Food was spoiled and taste was not good at all. After eating those dishes any one can fall sick. Don't ever order from here. They are charging for those spoiled dish around Rs 240 . Such a waste of money. When i called them saying food was spoiled and they replied me saying no mam its not possible.
4.0,"Nice place located at the HSR - silk board ring road. Roof top restaurant , not so good in decor, but if you are a food lover, then you have reached the right place in affordable prices.Ambience - 2.5/5 Veg Starters are not so great at this places. So make your choices wisely. Main course review : Paneer gravies are tasty . Paneer is very soft.We had Kadai Paneer - 4/5 Paneer Lababdar - 3.5/5 Paneer butter masala - 3/5 Coming to Breads , phulkas are very soft and they will make you feel homely with the amount of butter on it. Garlic naan and Pudina parathas are also very soft and crunchy . Kulchas are not so good here. Pls dnt try Lassi here, if you are hard core lassi lover. Basically drinks here like jaljeera, shikanji are quite average. Lassi - 2/5 Jaljeera - 2/5 Shikanji - 1.5/5 Thats it!! Enjoy yr meal :)"
5.0,Lassi chicken paneer kadhai tandoori name it and they have it in a typical north flavour.. its been 2.5 yrs i wasnt able to find my north taste but i guess now i have a destination for my north taste craving.. must go palce
4.0,"Food: 4.0 Food was like authentic North Indian..or rather Punjabi style that is rarely found in Bangalore.  Ambiance : 3.0 Its set up just like a Punjabi dhaba on the roof top.  Service : 4.0 It is up to the mark.  Hygiene : 3.0 Looked good to me  Visit for : If you want to eat real and good punjabi food, the this is the place to go.  Must Try : All the dishes...especially non-veg tandoori."
4.5,The place is crowded on weekends. One of the very few places to serve authentic North Indian food. Service is a little on the slower side but then thats not much of a problem. Overall great place to Dine.
1.0,"This was my second visit and I ordered takeaway of paneer tikka masala, butter naan and methi kulcha. The last thing that one can expect from a restaurant is stale stinking food. Sadly the paneer tikka masala was just that - stale and stinking as soon as the box was open. The breads had a strange texture as if there was dust which one could feel under the teeth. I doubt if I will ever be able to order from the restraunt again after this terribly poor experience. I sincerely wish the management can take serious note of the quality of the food."
4.5,"I haven't been to Punjab ever but this place definitely makes you wonder when will you get a chance to do so. If in far south punjabi food can taste so good, I wonder how it would be like in the foodie heartland itself.I so so want to try the dhaba food in Punjab itself"
4.0,"Been there with a friend recently. As it was around new year time, they had a different menu with limited items. The cheese Naan was awesome. All other items tasted good as well. Must try for all Punjabi cuisine lovers."
5.0,"On a day you want to binge on good indian food this would be the place to be.  Love their Murgh Chatkora, ZMP special chicken, the onion alloo cheese parantha, Dal Tadka and chaas!   I always end up going there with my colleagues when we are all super hungry and craving for good indian food. Never disappointed!   Must take a tiny bite of the gudh on the table :)"
4.0,Been here with family after hearing good feedback about their starters from one of my friend. We had verities of tandoor starters both in veg and non veg. Tastes good and fresh. A must try place if you in and around HSR LAYOUT.
3.0,"The ambience is decent and comfy. We ordered Sheekh Kebab, Punjabi Paneer Tikka, Methi Kucha, Butter Naan and Pindi Chole. The Kebab and Tikka were good. The Pindi Chole however was a bit disappointing. It was very mild. Considering the name I expected it to be spicy like they serve in Delhi. The Kucha and Naan were standard. It's a decent place but not very special."
4.5,Punjabi food yes this is the place to be amazing taste tangdi kabab n tandoori chicken must try . Try butter chicken gravy with rotis to fill ur tummy. All items are finger licking good. Must visit place to all punjabi food lovers
1.0,"We had been to this place today. Ordered a buttermilk, pudhina water, punjabi paneer tikka, and some zmp chicken gravy with roti, amritsari kulcha, lachcha paratha and gulab jamoon. The food tasted brilliant and I was very satisfied. Then on the way back home we were both in such a state that we had to rush home to use the rest room. Very bad food poisoning, I'm generally very immune and have never got any prob due to food.  The reason I have stated every dish is so you be careful while ordering any of them. It's such a disappointment. Taste should be an imp factor but at the same time quality is the utmost necessity. Also we had our breakfast at home and diff places so this is def the food at ZMP."
4.0,"Zero mile Punjab is a rooftop Dhaba type restaurant.  I went for lunch there got escaped from queues. During dinner time, you guys need to wait for some time.  Price is reasonable and Food is also tasty here."
4.0,"Do you need a dhaba type feeling near the silkboard traffic? Can we get this in Bangalore ?  Of course people, and thanks to ""Zero Mile Punjab"".  This place is a gem in HSR layout, low budget deal with tasty food and carefree dhaba ambiance.  Almost all are must try here, but the only drawback is long wait time.  It is managed by a punjabi family, very courteous.  For more checkout my blog veganstomach.wordpress.com"
3.0,"Good food, but not extraordinary...  Maybe you can go for one or two times  Staff and managers very polite and well behaved and gives you a relaxed ambience"
4.0,A desi dhaba with authentic punjabi food.Food : 4/5 Service : 4/5 Ambience : 4/5 Overall Experience : 4/5
4.5,"If you are a punjabi or love punjabi food, this is the place for you.   Ambience: The interiors and the ambience was of a typical punjabi dhabas. Normal chairs and with no over the top tables were put up, with interiors where we could feel the essence of Punjab, with amazing punjabi posters.  Hospitality: The hospitality was commendable with one of the waiters heading us towards the best table. The service was fast and waiters were very friendly and polite.  Food: The best part about Zero Mile Punjab is its food, the best ever punjabi food I have had in the recent times. Murgh kastoori tikka and Murgh chatkora were the two starters which were ordered and the former was outstanding. With a bit of hung curd, Murgh kastoori tikka was one of the best chicken starters I have ever had. On the other hand, the latter was on a spicier side, equally good. For the main course we had ordered dal makhani, which was not at all heavy and we could taste the punjab in it, and punjabi paneer (photo attached) which was amazing. The best part was it's parathas and kulchas, where we had ordered masala kulcha, Amritsar kulcha and ajwain paratha. Out of all, ajwain paratha was outstanding, which had given us a homely feeling. The other two kulchas were brilliant too. In the end we ordered butter milk and pudeene ka pani. Butter milk was okay, but pudeene ka paani was the best digestive ever.   Overall experience: Murgh kastoori tikka and pudeene ka paani are a must try. It was really an amazing experience and would suggest all the punjabis and punjabi food lovers to visit the place. Outstanding overall experience."
5.0,Came to this place with friends. Awesome food. Great ambiance. Had to wait for a long time but the service was worth the wait.  I also recommended this place for a team lunch and fortunately they loved it too.
2.0,"Weekday dinner ruined perfectly and also ended up spoiling the next day constitution of the body. I and hubby ended up here on the way home for quick bite. The reviews raised our hope and ratings cemented the choice. We had hopes of a decent meal.  The ambiance is decent enough. It has a very simple dhaba like feel, with chattai hanging on the wall, terracotta tiles for roof, the rickety table and chairs. The cleanliness is definitely not on par. There was not a single person when we walked in, still no one had bothered to clean the tables. We walked in to one of worlds worst customer service. The waiter?? helper?? walked up and gave us a tattered menu to order from. Since we were hungry we got right to it and ordered Dal makhani, Panner Tikka, Amritsari Kulcha, Masala Kulcha, Lassi and Shikanji. To this we were asked, ""No Starters"" as if we committed a crime, any how, we ordered a Masala Papad.  What a disappointment, the masala papad was soggy and tasteless. The Dal Makhani was high on chili and nothing else, Panner Tikka was hard and cold. Kulchas were Under Cooked and Burnt at the same time. By this time I was ready to throw in the towel, but alas, we were hungry and just gobbled everything. The saving grace was Lassi, it had the right amount of sweet and flavour. The Shikanji is also avoidable, it looks like dirty water and not at all appetizing.To conclude, a pretty avoidable place unless and until you just wanna grab a bite and dont care what happens later.  Price wise it is not tough on your wallet, the whole dinner costed us approx 680INR.Tip: Carry your own hand sanitizer, you dont want to visit there hand washing area at any cost !"
4.5,"Going by the reviews, I had expectations from the restaurant!  Its has a great ambience, rooftop sitting and the authenticity of the Punjabi Dhaba! Now let's get to the food.. We ordered chicken malai tikkas as starters, ZMP special chicken, butter roti, rose flavoured lassi The malai tikkas were love at first sight and the taste was simply something to die for. It was soft, tender, juicy, great texture of flavor of panner, curd and cheese on the crust! ( A must have!) The ZMP special chicken was good too. It was large pieces of chicken tandoored and cooked in a medium spiced brown onion gravy. And butter roti were cooked to perfection. The lassi is served in a glass as in a cafe which could have been better! Overall a good experience, would love to visit again! See u soon!"
4.5,This place is never empty.... And what a unique taste especially the chicken items.... The zm special chicken starter is so delecious... A must have there....all chicken items taste awesome here... And then trademark lassi is amazing....want a taste of punjabi tadka..this place is a must visit.... Owner calling us sirji....felt like I was in punjab actually....two weeks and already been there twice...value for money for sure....!!!!!
3.0,"Went there with family on a weeknight, it was empty but after sometime few people came. We had karahi paneer, kofta with roti, naan and kulchas. Everything tasted okay, somehow I had high expectation after reading some reviews here. I've had better punjabi food at other restaurants in Bangalore."
3.5,Visited the place with my friends on Wednesday. Food tastes very good. But they have to concentrate on serving when more crowded. 4 for the food and 2.5 for the service
4.0,This place looks better on zomato than in reality. It is managed in a desi style. Lot of shouting noise from kitchen and no uniform for waiters. Tried their Zero Mile Punjabi special chicken with naan and ghee rice. The taste was great. Would love to go back and try their other items. I highly recommend it for the punjabi food lovers.
4.0,"Went on wednesday at around 9 :30 pm..... Didn't had to wait was fairly empty so dats gud... Well about ambience... Sort of a desi dhaba feel is given something similar to what you see in many restaurants... The plates used were of stainless steel though was clean so lets say its not their forte.... Which is though is the food.... Me and 3 more of my friends all gluttons ordered a variety of items..  In starter we tuk murgh chatkora and it was damn gud never had such a nice preperation of tandoor chicken (modified version of it  I.e) next in main course had Paneer makhni.... Quantity was gud in fact very gud worth the money and even the Paneer was damn soft rwminded me of the Paneer u get in Delhi.. In non veg main had zmp special murgh Which is slightly on the spicier side and murgh punjabi masala both were gud.... And tuk the Kulchas..... The amritsari (Paneer stuffed) and masala Kulcha (stuffed veg) and slightly spicy compared to the amritsari counterpart..... Ordered too many of it and tuk back a few back home..... And oh Yeah special mention to the lassi... The thickest till date I had in bangalore.. You have to really work hard to have it with the straw given... Can give a spoon, will be easier... Just a thought as whenever I had this much thick before all were served with a spoon..... Anyways very gud experience and damn gud value for money... Wanna have authentic punjabi food definately come to this place"
4.5,If u want to try North Indian food best place to go! First of all if I had to just go to this place without zomato m sure I would have never found this place.... So I wanna thank zomato for suggesting this place awesome food... And if owner comes to you n talk with you it's totally different I liked that part :) I am definitely going next time
4.0,Great Food to have Dinner with your beloved one's. Starters are pretty good specially with Kalmi kabab. Had a spicy Punjabi food items after a long time. Order should be arrived quickly in order to serve your repeated customer's. Cost wise it's not that much costly and it's reasonable as well.. good serving team......
4.5,Hariyani panner and murgh tikka with chicken kabab taste outstanding i really appreciate the chef and entire teams that who did this magic works.
4.0,"I visited Zero Mile Punjab many times when it was in Electronic City. They used to serve good punjabi food, especially Paneer lababdaar and paranthas (my personal fav at ZMP). They are highly cost effective and ambiance was ok. However during weekends it is full and take time to serve your order. we don't get much option in desert. But starter and main course were awesome. Now I have heard they have raised their prices and changed their location. However I would still love to visit new place."
4.5,"It Was Really Awesome To Have Punjabi Cuisine Food After So Many Days !!!! Felt Quite Awesome ... Best Tasty Delicious Makhanwala Punjabi Food !!! I Started With Panner Tikka Which Was Quite Splendid !! Then I Had Murg Makhni, Panner Makhani & Butter Tawa Roti..... Was A Really Buttery Buttery Dinner ....But Was Really Awesome...."
4.5,Wonderful experience. The waiter suggested what we were looking for and it was perfect. Quality was fabulous but quantity is bit less and can be improved otherwise can be full 5 out of 5
5.0,"This is one of the best Punjabi food joint in HSR layout.  murgh chatkora- (Woooow) is very unique & very very tasty  Paneer do pyaaza - had that authentic Punjabi flavor which has a bit of spicy taste Amritsar Kulcha - soft, crisp, buttery, thick, stretchy, hot  Aloo paratha - in real Amritsar style paratha with 2 layers  Recommend: murgh chatkora,Paneer do pyaaza,Amritsar Kulcha , Aloo paratha  It is really value for money & awesome Punjabi food want to visit again & again"
3.0,"Came here for a lunch. The food is just ok. More salt in dishes would have been better. Friends complained that the food was blant , personally it was just about ok and can be tried once.  Would request the management to check on the food in this regard. (They forgot to bring fish fry which we had ordered , that was blessing in disguise since we were full) but would definitely try it once again."
4.0,Best northindian foods and varietys of kabab items open terrace ambience rocks also price very cheap and best we love it thanks for quality food and pannertikka with butter kulcha .
2.5,"We ordered murgh chatkora, murgh makhani, punjabi chicken masala, haryali paneer, kadai paneer, dal makhani along with masala kulcha, butter naan and jeera rice. The food was good but since the rating of the restaurant is so high we expected a lot more. Another problem which was some my friends had was that the food was excessively oily so if you are somebody who is very diet conscious, avoid going to this place. Murgh chatkora and haryali paneer were the highlights. If you are a fan of punjabi food and don't mind a little oily, you should try this place once."
5.0,"This place serves the best north Indian food in bangalore. Ambience wise it's not much, but once you  taste their food,you will forget everything else.what I recommend here is everything.. all the starters excell in there own field and main course.. words can't describe it. What makes this place special is the person who's in charge . The way he treats everyone,you will feel like you are home.  FYI : good food takes time to prepare.. be patient."
4.0,"""Ghar ka khana"", the food does taste like that! Service is quick and food , like I said, is good: not a lot of masalas, just like home. Tried chole and dal makhani, pretty good job there.  Expect a queue for this place offers food that is value for money given Bangalore standards of north Indian food."
4.0,"The place for authentic panjabi food . Staffs are very friendly.Tried keema chicken,buter tawa roti,Murgh makhni,Murgh tikka and shikanjee . You would get that panjab flavor in all the dishes . Delicious food and price is reasonable . As its close from my workplace , I keep going here .. Must try if u like panjab da flavor"
4.5,"Was Looking for an authentic Punjabi style food, searched in zomato and found this place. Read reviews and went there.  Initially this place looks a little shady but the smell of food makes you think other wise.  Had a great lunch there. Every dish - Starters, Curries, Rotis and Lassi was amazing. We felt like eating in a Dhaba in North India.  Would definitely recommend based on taste & pricing."
3.5,It was an impromptu decision to come to this place .. we had all vegetarian .. and the panner malai tikka has to be mentioned especially as it was just out of the world... though the breads were not so up to the mark... I was disappointed...  lassi and butter milk were decent enough... but we had a small fly in the butter milk served ... please improve on this!!!  Over all  Food - 3 Value for money - 4 Service - 3.5 Ambience - 3
4.5,"Food is simple and non- commercial but the taste is impeccable. Service needs a bit of improvement but seems they have shortage of stewards due to the gone holiday season. Must try dishes are Punjabi Paneer Tikka, Paneer Kastoori tikka, and Murgh Chatkora. Of the mains one can try ZMP Special Murgh, Peshawari Murgh, Daal Makhni."
1.5,"They prepare their curries in the evening itself and when I ordered two curries, it was smelling so hard, such that I have to leave the whole thing and ate outside. Tried it twice, not worthy at all."
4.5,"What's the epitome of service? Gloved butlers with impeccable manners and ever ready smiles? Or cheerful cute flirty waitresses? To me it's here at Zero Mile Punjab where the uncle at the counter calls you ""beta"". I was instantly at home with that one remark. I knew I was going to be taken care of.  The food - easily the best punjabi food I've had in Bangalore. Simple, fresh, RICH, flavourful. There are three types of North Indian restaurant types in town - (a) the agrandised experience of decor and decorum which makes the food pale in comparison (b)the mid level place with mid level food or basic place with basic food (c) specular food in unexpected places. Zero Mile Punjab is the option C.  Lassi - Perfect  Murgh Tikka - so good that I didn't care that I burnt my mouth trying to gobble it all.  Murgh Makhni - Original Delhi/Punjab style amazing Kali dal/dal makhni - so good I was drinking it like soup after some point.  Amritsari Kulcha - soft, crisp, buttery, thick, stretchy, hot and everything you want from a Kulcha.    Although we waited for a good 40 minutes to get the food it was totally worth it.   I don't give a damn that the ambience was basic.   Thank you Akshar Udupa for introducing me to the best damn  punjabi restaurant in town."
4.5,Nice place.food is really good.service was also nice. Near HSR again there is punjabi flavoured resturant which will tickle our taste buds.ty
4.5,"By far the best Punjabi cuisine served in the HSR area. The warmth of owners is also reflected in the quality of the food. Special call-outs: Murgh (Chicken) Chatkora, Chicken Tandoori, Punjabi Paneer Tikka. Rotis/ Naans are fairly good.   Efficiency is not their forte yet However, given their food quality, it's worth the wait Also, this place is recommended for take-aways and not a proper sit-down meal. Maybe this is one aspect the owners can focus over next 1 year without comprising the food quality."
4.0,Food is excellent. There is not much you can expect for ambience.. More like a dhaaba.. Service is good as well.. But no prebooking here.. First come first served basis.. A very affordable place even for a very large group  Definitely would suggest this place.
5.0,"We had come to this place for team lunch. We had Peshawari paneer tikka, veg gilafi seekh,murg chatkora for starters. We had kali mirch wala murgi for mains, paneer tikka and varieties of breads. We also had Icecreams and lassi for dessert. Overall, great place for north indian cuisine and well worth the money."
5.0,"Everything you order turns out to be good and delicious.We had masala kulchas,paneer makhani,chicken lababdaar,tawa rotis,lassis,naans.. The end of the delicious meal is by the paan shop available right at the exit. The service is super cool.they work diligently there,always at your service.The owner guy is super friendly and cares about if you have any issues with the food. The ambience is cool,beautiful ,cozy and adorned with little countryside pictures and paintings. Overall a thumbs up.Recommended anytime everytime!"
5.0,"Come here if you are tired of the ubiquitous standardized restaurant North Indian dishes.  Had chicken chatkora and tandoori chicken for starters - chatkora was definitely a ZMP special and lived up to its name, and tandoori chicken was just the way you would want it - cooked to the core and still juicy. In the main course we had a chicken and a mutton dish- two different worlds altogether. You could actually tell that they were freshly prepared and the gravies were not like you would find elsewhere. I specially loved the mutton but chicken went really well with the Nan.  Portions were really good for the price(which is pocket friendly).  As far as ambiance is concerned the place has a rather laid back feel(with prompt service) of an urban Dhaba and we really loved the breezy rooftop experience.  I am definitely going back.  P.S. Try the sweet pan after the meal."
5.0,"A very honest review from a foodie:  To begin with , this place at the first instance has a very decent setup and if you are looking for true authentic Punjabi flavours experience , this might be the place for you.  They have plenty of starters with varied main course in menu and not to forget a very refreshing Lassi to savour in the end. I personally liked the chicken kastoori starter . Chicken just melted with distinct aromatic flavours as i cut through it.Naan served with main course was true to its nature and i loved the mutton recipe. One thing about this place is that they don't commit what they can't deliver.  This place deserves your attention if you love desi authentic cuisines."
2.5,Big disappointed ! . We tried veg/non-veg starters (ZMP special). Not up to the standard. Felt like eating at a ordinary restaurant. Even..in main course we tried many things and bread items...I felt it is too many mile away in taste!!
2.0,"I am not sure what triggered others to rate it so extra ordinary. It's a usual restaurant with below average dish qualities. Dishes they claim to be spicy are actually not spicy but normal. I assume the dishes they claim non spicy will be sweet. Being a Punjabi, I am sure the palak paneer they served was not authentic.   However phulkas, butter milk and shikanjee was very good."
4.5,Starters are just amazing.. And the lassi is awesome. They serve it in a small glass bottle. Went for a team lunch and ended up over eating. But it was worth it. Quantity is quite generous. This place can definitely be visited more than once when the taste buds want a punjabi treat.
3.0,"Unexpected lunch with friends in HSR, so one of my friend suggested zero mile Punjab. So I was ready to try some Punjabi food on Sunday afternoon. This restaurant is on 5th floor and it look like a dhaba style restaurant.   We 4 of us ordered one starter which was Murgh chaktora. Which was sufficient for 4 people. I should I admit we made a better decision after choosing this starter. It tasted very good trust me.   We ordered two curries, it was ZMP special murgh and kalimirch waala murgh. When they served Zmp special murgh on the table there was a bad smell coming from the bowl and it did not taste good also few chicken pieces was old i think because it tasted very bad. The kalimirch waala murgh was tasty and had the proper pepper taste.   For the curries we ordered lacha paratha from Indian bread and aloo paratha. Lacha paratha was hot and crispy and it was just okay, Aloo paratha tasted good. We asked to put butter on the aloo paratha and it tasted much much better than normal.   For drinks we ordered sweet lassi, butter milk roohafaza lassi, shikanjee and soft drinks. Sweet lassi and shikanjee tasted nice and roohafaza was not up the mark. And butter milk tasted horrible.   Service and ambiance: Service was just okay and ambiance was like dhaba so just like a normal dhaba shop. There is nothing much to talk about service and ambiance.   Overall it was a good Punjabi experience, The food was tasty. This restaurant look like a cheap and shady place, so I thought it will be cheaper. But when then bill came i understood it was not pocket friendly.   For 4 of us the the total bill value was 1502 INR. I think we can opt better restaurant for this price which has better service, ambiance and food. Worth a try but not more than one.  @"
4.0,"Biggest positive: value for money  Negative: waiting period during peak hours  Recommended dish: murg chatkora   Located in HSR. When coming from the silk board side, take the right at the first signal after silk board and then again right to  join the service road. The service road here is quite broad, so car parking can be managed comfortably. The restaurant is on the 5th floor. Lift is available, but the last 1 floor will need to be climbed by stairs. The ambience is average, is brightly lit and bustling. They do not take reservations. The place becomes full on weekend nights by about 8:30. So visiting before that you are likely to get a table immediately, but after 8:30 there may be a 5-15 minutes wait for a table. The service was quick. The owner is helpful in giving directions to the place. The staff are polite, but are a little clueless about the items on the menu.   The food is tasty. The murg chatkora is their specialty dish and it was tasty, liked the flavour of the dish. Served with a chutney that was quite tasty as well. The sultaani sheek chicken was ok, was a little too firm to my liking. The masala papad was standard. The lassi is a regular Punjabi lassi. The main course indian breads are simple and made without much ghee which was good. The tabs roti was a single light phulka, the naan was also good. The ZMP special murg gravy was just ok.   The quantity is decent. The starters come in either half or full portions. The prices are average. There is a 10% service charge as the only added price to over what is on the menu.   On the whole, it's a good Punjabi restaurant for some authentic, simple Punjabi food in a simple place at a good price."
4.0,Wanted to try some North Indian place other than Punjabi Rasoi in Hsr layout and here I got my answer. Read all the good reviews about this place and yes I would say this place lived up to the expectations. The pricing and the taste of the food makes it to the category of must visit multiple times. The ambience is also pretty decent.
4.5,"This is one of the best Punjabi food joint. We reached during closing time on a weekday so couldn't taste their special chicken chatkori but will definitely visit soon. This is a rooftop joint and a very peaceful one. The focus is only on food and the soft chicken pieces which melts in your mouth. We ordered ZM special chicken which was very delicious and Malai murg methi which was equally awesome. If you are craving for ""the panjaaabi food"", you can visit here. Ambience is modest but they have kept very clean and maintained. We were chatting with ZM uncle and he informed us that in HSR it started 5 months back. He was very courteous. Food wise must visit Punjabi joint.awesome tasty authentic Punjabi food, I loved it"
5.0,"The only thing that can get better than the sumptuous, succulent food here is the courteousness of the Owner and the cuteness level of his dad!!The meat (chicken/fish/mutton) is so soft that you feel it melt in your mouth>ME being a hardcore Non Veggie, end up ordering Veg gravies more often mainly because Veg never tasted so good!!"
4.0,You will get the perfect Punjabi food with that dhaba vibes if you will visit here.I went on as Sunday and the place was totally crowded.if you want to only eat good food without any ambience or any special service then this is a right place.there murgh chatkora is very unique and nun is also very soft and perfect.perfect place for desi food lover.
4.0,"Tried this place today for lunch. Being a resident of HSR, after seeing it's ratings on Zomato, I really wanted to try this place. Finally got the chance.  I will start with what I really liked. The menu has a lot to offer ranging from veg to non veg and we tried a lot of stuff in veg and non veg both. To go with the owner's suggestion and what people had mentioned in zomato reviews, we started with Punjabi paneer tikka which was really good, tandoori phool was okay too. Murgh chatkora and ajwaini fish tikka live upto the expectations.  Main course too had a lot of options. Paneer do pyaaza had that authentic Punjabi flavor which has a bit of taste of curd too. Achari bhindi was different and good. Murgh ajwaini again was delicious. The Amritsari kulchas were a delight with the flavor of real desi ghee. Lassi was okay.  Overall it was a delight to taste such authentic Punjabi flavors in HSR. The food lives upto your expectations.  The things which I didn't like much was the ambience, which could have been better considering the crowd that visits. The plates and normal water bottle could have been in a better condition.  Though the name suggests the place to be as dhaba, but I think the crowd of Bangalore still prefers cleanliness and good ambience."
4.5,First of all the lift can carry only 3 people. So beware of that. Its got a dhaba type ambiance. Food was great. Chicken tikka nd seekh kabab were amazing. Says Punjabi but the cooks and waiters are from Odissa.
3.5,"Met here for a friend's birthday treat. ZMP was in my wishlist but couldnt visit due to location constraints previously.  We ordered Tandoori Mushroom, Paneer Malai and Murgh kasturi tikka. These starters were good. Then we ordered Murgh Lasooni Tikka. The chicken was uncooked in this tikka and it literally dissappointed me. I complained about it to the manager and they told that they will not add the dish in the bill. But this doesnt make the experience any better for us.  Anyways, we ordered the maincourse. We ordered Murgh Punjabi Masala and Panjabi Paneer Tikka. The main course was average . Among indian breads, we ordered Naan, Tawa roti and Kulcha.  OVerall an average experience.                                                                 foodgasmdiaries.wordpress.com"
2.0,One Liner - Normal Dhaba with high rates.Service - 1/5. Service time was very high. Waiter came after 20min of our arrival for taking the order. Every time we need to wait for 5-10min for him. Ambience - 2/5. We expected a open roof top with good environment. But the seating env was of normal dhaba and not matching your price.Taste - 3.5/5. Taste was good. Not much problem with it.Not worth the money. Cost for two >600. It is advisable to go for a normal Dhaba for a better price and taste.
4.5,"Yummy punjabi food - rotis, sabzi, lassi.. all good. Ambience is decent. Service is good. Must go place for people who love punjabi food. Rates are not so high.  2/4/2017-Went today again. My impression towards this restaurant has gone higher. Ordered Nawabi sabzee and we didnt like it. We didnt want to waste it so asked him to parcel. We didnt even complain. But they understood we didnt like it. They took our feedback and gave us a 50% discount straight away.. what a great customer hospitality!!"
2.5,"The ambiance was good. We ordered sultani aloo , kadai paneer and 5rotis. Sultani aloo was good but we didn't like the taste of kadai paneer. It had a sour taste and there was too much of spices. The taste of cardamom and cinnamon was too prominent."
3.0,"Ambience - 3/5. Food -3/5. Service 3/5. Price 4/5. Location & Parking - 4/5  Zomato rating of 4+ coaxed me to try out this restaurant with high expectations. However, experience was not worth 4+. Restaurant is on service lane of ORR, hence centrally located and easy to spot. Good parking options. It is on 5th floor with lift up to 4th floor.  Restaurant is on top floor with thatched roof. There is no AC. Seating is average with wooden chair table. Some of them without cushion too. No sofas.  We ordered Shikanji, Lassi and Peshawari Chicken. I wanted to have lime soda which they didn't have. Food arrived on time but I didn't relish the taste. It was quite average.  We were with small kids and appreciate quick service. But we had to remind waiter 2-3 times. I won't say service is bad but I have seen better.  Conclusion - I won't recommend it to anyone not I will reject this place. Its just another one of the many restaurants in HSR. Pretty average."
4.5,"Located just before the silk board signal it easy to locate . It is on the 5th floor and the seating is not very pleasing at the first look But will definitely give you a desi feel to you!!! I have been to this place many times and the place was consistent always. The food is so yum!! You should try the falooda mix, it's killer! Only one thing that is a little off the place is you'll need to wait for a long time."
4.5,"I have now visited this place 4 times in a month's time. A lovely place and a no-frills restaurant. The chatkora murgh is a must have!! Quantity of curry is also appropriate. Waiting during peek hours. Food items are very good , mainly based on paneer."
3.5,"This roof top dhaba like place is a true Punjabi food heaven. Tried a lot of chicken and fish starters, and each of them tasted nice. Special mention to the seekh kababs and tandoori gobhi.  The main course was also nice. Palak Paneer was good and Chicken Rada also tasted nice. The breads were fresh. A little disappointing to know that they do not serve garlic naan.Their nimbu Shikangi deserves a special mention.  A huge meal for 4 costed around 1400 bucks which is a steal. Great place for easy on pocket yummy grub"
4.0,Hoooommmmmeeee to me and all my college mates.. was located in ecity earlier but now in hsr.. even more accessible to everyone in the city.. homely food.. every dish tastes its best and original.. rooftop adds to the amazing serene ambience.. a very frequent-to-visit place !!
3.5,"Its a dhabha like place in HSR located on the service road connecting to silk board. The place was crowded when we went for dinner but we got a place soon. We felt a little cramped when seated, the tables in the middle row are kept in one straight line which means you can literally hear out your neighbors or even nudge your elbows! I think they can work on making it a bit more spacious by maybe removing one table.  The paneer tikka in the starters is good with soft flavorful paneer.   Daal makhni was a little on the sweet side, it was cooked well but it did not have the authentic taste. Kadhai paneer was delicious.   I really loved their masala kulcha, one of the best I have had in a long time.   Laccha parantha was good too."
4.0,Pure dhaba style resto with service is not as fast as any dhaba but taste is delicious. Had Ajwain fish tikka for starter and it is second best fish tikka i had in my life and i would recommend everyone to have and had ZMP special chicken which was good not great. Tawa roti gives home feel.
3.0,"Ambience 3/5 Food 4/5 Service 2/5(they dont know how to manage crowd) Cost 3/5   Mutton : excellent. Very soft, fresh, tasty. Curries were very nice. Don't take Amritsari fish: tasteless. Worst. Roti very good. Naan, Amritsari kulcha must. Chicken Lahori is good.  Chicken curry good."
1.0,"Zero Mile Punjab is really a ""Zero"" in terms of taste, good in terms of ambience. went there for diner orders tanduri roti was like papad & mix veg was pathetic. So much time they took to serve as well. After eating this didn't feel like to order anything."
3.0,"After exhausting every good restaurant in Koramangala, we were craving some great North Indian food. Zero Mile Punjab was actually 1 mile away so we thought of trying it out. Given its 4+ rating, we never thought we'd be disappointed.  First of all, the place is a bit shabby and tried to kill all the good vibes. We ordered Peshawari Paneer Tikka for starters and expected it to be really good since it's a 4+ restaurant. It was substandard. Paneer was quite hard and chewy which killed all the fun. Next, we ordered Paneer Punjabi for the main course. We were aghast when we saw the dish the waiter brought. It looked like one of those Chinese gravies with lots of onions and watered down tomato puree. It was absolutely terrible. To save the day, we had Desi Ghee Tadka Dal which was quite amazing and had a lot of 'tinge"" of garlic. Rotis and breads were decent.  Overall, it was not a good experience and compared to other places like DFP or Punjabi Rasoi, this restaurant actually hurts the pocket."
4.5,"Went there late in the night thinking I may not get anything. Ordered Punjabi Paneer and butter roti along with buttermilk. The Paneer was awesome, very rich and flavourful. The rotis very thin and soft, could have been a bit more warmer. The buttermilk good consistency but, the salt was a bit more. They gave me an opportunity to order some more rotis even though it was closing time."
3.5,Went here cause of the overwhelming reviews floating on zomato. Now lets get to it Ambience 1.5 it's nothing but the food will not disappoint u i ordered their special panner curry and it was good so was the chicken tikkas all in all a good place to eat and is budget friendly P.S U WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR A TABLE FOR 20 mins at least on weekends for dinner
4.5,I went a week back with friends and ordered starters Malai chicken and Matar Paneer with roti. Awesome food with good taste.Good behavior of owner and staff but there was too much waiting. Overall Excellent
4.0,"One of the few places in Bangalore which serves good food at an economical price. I had ordered Tikkas, a Chicken curry, Rotis and Parathas. The Tikka was the best among all. Service is also quite commendable."
3.0,"Took parcel from this place. Tried there Chicken tandori. Chicken tadoori was very dry, seems like they use big chicken. Overall average food"
4.5,"Amazing food, good service and a very decent ambiance..Definitely a try for all the North Indian food lovers..Only music was missing to which they replied the system will be in place soon..Pudine ka pani and chicken tikka masala is recommended."
4.5,"Well ... average place, decent service, average ambience but incredible food..went there for weekend lunch, ordered chicken tikka, zmb special chicken and both were absolutely worth it. There pudina pani is a must try.."
2.5,Decent North Indian - Punjabi fare.  We ordered  in from here a couple of times. It's not finger licking good but never disappoints either. Their signature chicken curry can be worked upon for better taste. The 2.5 rating is for the one time we visited this place.. The chicken dint taste very fresh and took really long for the food to arrive. Ambiance n quality needs some improvement.
4.0,"Pudine Ka Paani - Light and extremely refreshing drink - loved this!  Tandoori Mushrooms and Tandoori Phool - A couple of broccoli pieces were raw in the center but otherwise moist and succulent dishes.  Aloo and Onion Paratha, Gobi Paratha - cooked in a different style I had not tasted before. Hot and tasty.  Jeera Rice - Flavorful.  The quantities are decent for the price. The furniture was not to my comfort and liking but the ambience was very dhaba-like. A late evening outing would be perfect!"
4.5,"It just can't be better!!!! amazing food!! Pretty decent ambience, nice staff n best past part it's pocket friendly. Lassi, Cheese parantha(aalu or Gobi)are must try."
5.0,"Good north Indian food at a decent price...The roof top ambience is good , considering awesome weather around this time of the year...Definitely recommended"
5.0,Amazing  food.... Friendly  staff.....great evening  spent... Reasonable  price...... Great place  to hangout.... Must try Jamun ice cream and Lassi.... Guys take ur frnds  for treat
4.5,"Superb place !! I have been to this place many times and the place was consistent always. The food is so yum!! You should try the falooda mix, it's killer! It tastes authentic and staff is friendly. Not a place for ambience. Go there just for good food at a reasonable price."
1.0,"Visited this place after seeing its rating and reviews on zomato. But to my surprise it was nowhere near the hype it has on zomato. We ordered a veg platter, murg tikka and kalmi-kabab for starters. None of the item tasted good. Chicken was not even marinated properly and all the Starters had a weird oily smell. Now coming to main-course. We ordered Dal-makhni and punjabi paneer. Paneer they served was sour and stale, on complaining owner came saying that its not stale, they might have added extra vinegar or chat masala to the dish. Then he replaced the Dish. Dalmakhni had a sweet taste to it, which ruined it for me. Breads were okay. The last thing that spoiled the mood was the ambiance of the place. They only have plastic chairs to sit with wooden tables. And didn't even gave glasses for cold drinks."
3.5,nice and decent place for dine thanks to all of u for your friendly behave and food like to visit again soon keep up good work guys ...............
4.0,"You enter a puNjabi hotel and you see two sardarji incharge , then you know you have come to the right place. This is a perfect place for all those who want to have a proper punjabi food. Even the ambience is similar to that of a dhaba.  Located just before the silk board signal it easy to locate . It is on the 5th floor and the seating is not very pleasing at the first look But will definitely give you a desi feel to you.  We had a chicken chaptokara and chicken kastoori as the starter. The chaptokara was a delight. It was a succelent tandoori chicken with a twist if slight tanginess. This is a dish to rejuvenate your taste buds . The kastoori chicken was good and had proper amount of cheese with it. We had a zmp chicken special for main course , the dish was giid. The gravy was simiar to the chicken korma that we generally have. The kulcha and naan were also good.  The shikanjee came with a surprise and was very refreshing. The roohafza lassi could have been better. One expects a better thick lassi with some rabri on top from a puNjabi restaurant.  The service is very fast. You will not have to wait for long after you order. They could improve on the washing area , infact they can start finger bowls to improve the customer satisfaction.  Overall good experience , could work a little on the ambience and cleanliness. No mutton on the menu was a let down.. Rest it's great with respect to food. Would surely recommend."
5.0,"One of the juiciest Tandoori chicken I've ever eaten. I generally ask for delivery, very prompt and very professional in taking the order. A very happy customer for ZMP. Will keep ordering"
2.5,"Went to this place after reading encouraging reviews on Zomato. And was accompanied by a friend of mine who is totally vegetarian. The items were not even borderline passable! Ordered the below items: Kumbh lazeez- was ok Dal desi ghee tadka- no ghee and only topped with refined oil !!! Amritsari kulche- stuffing was missing. Kadai mix veg- worst of the lot. Completely banal and inedible Green salad- just that Bagare chawal- undercooked rice lacking any distinctive aroma and a colossal waste. The worst part was the hand-wash section, which resembled an open (leaking)drain with a filthy stench."
5.0,Good restaurant for Punjabi tasted food.  peaceful.  Rooftop dining ambience is good.  Service is very good.  At ending the way of giving gud(jaggery) is so good keeping old tradition. All the best
5.0,If you are looking for punjabi taste in Bangalore.... Than look no more..... ZMP is the place that will quench the thirst of your taste buds for real punjabi taste.....
4.5,Been here 3 times and they maintained same taste and quality of food. It's truly value for money. I have also taken my friend's and they also liked the food a lot.
4.0,"Good Food.Good Service.Decent Ambience  Walking into this place I didn't have high hopes,I was more interested in filling my hungry stomach over having a very good dining experience. I was left satisfied in both aspects once i was done.  The quantity provided is really something i would like to appreciate,These people seem to understand how hungry we 20 or less year olds are.   I would although request the management to please look into fixing the hand wash area as there is a very unpleasant smell that's there and leaves a bad mark."
4.0,This is the good place again where we found good north Indian food specially paneer malai tikka mouth melting paneer and also loved their butter naan also so good
3.0,"The staters - Paneer Tikka and Chicken Chatkora was good. The gravies - Butter Chicken and Amritsari Kofta could have been better. This is more like ""non-commercial"" Punjabi Food. The prices are quite high for the kind of place it is. They need to either provide finger bowls or keep the hand wash area clean."
3.5,It's a simple place on terrace with no ambience. Food is good. Punjabi ambience was totally lacking there. Food was being served in plastic plates n bowls which I didn't liked at all. Felt like having food in some street side dhaba. In my suggestion they should work on ambience and play some punjabi music to add some lovely ambience. Food Taste: 3.5 Ambience: 1 Service: 3 Value for Money: 4
4.5,"Superb place !!  I have been to this place many times and the place was consistent always. The food is so yum!! You should try the falooda mix, it's killer! Only one thing that is a little off the place is you'll need to wait for a long time.   Must try:  Chicken tikka  Mushroom tikka  Falooda mix Bagare chawal Chicken tikka masala"
3.5,Place is very simple on the top floor of the building. Not a lavish place. The starters were really yummy but main course was not as expected. Paneer tikka in the starters was the best. The service staffs were very friendly the guy in the counter was rude.
4.5,"I have now visited this place 4 times in a month's time. A lovely place and a no-frills restaurant. The chatkora murgh is a must have. ZMP spl. chicken curry is just awesome & goes well with the Amritsari kulcha.  For vegetarians, try the Amritsari Kofta. Dal makhni is awesome.  The owners are very friendly & call out the time it will take to serve specific dishes. A must go place if you love Punjabi food!"
4.5,Have been here couple of times and loved the food everytime. It tastes authentic and staff is friendly. Not a place for ambience. Go there just for good food at a reasonable price.
3.5,Not much crowded during weekdays. Food was quite good. We ordered palak paneer and mushroom Punjabi. Mushroom Punjabi was too good. Even sweet lassi also best. Suggestions : please provide finger bowl after a meal.
4.5,"Very good punjabi food. Good and fast service. Quantity of curry is also appropriate.  Waiting during peek hours.  Food menu is items are very good ,mainly based on pamer. I oredered veg. Food."
4.5,We went there on a weekend and was crowded ....but I must say the food was awesome...pure dhaaba type feeling.....and very cheap on pocket....a must place to visit again
4.5,"We went here for Sunday dinner and the place was quite crowded. We were lucky enough to get a table because within half an hour,  there were more than 20 people waiting!   We ordered Murg Chatkora, peshawari chicken with tawa roti and shikanzee. The food was AWESOME. The starter was amazing,  the gravy was very different and tasted too good.   The owners are extremely nice, overhead their conversation with some other customer that at the end of the day they just want all their customers to be satisfied.   Value for money-4. 5/5 Our food cost us below 700. Wonderful experience here!!"
4.0,"The restaurant is in HSR, i had few hiccups to find the place although the restaurant is just on service road.  Google Maps Shows wrong Location :(  The place has decent ambience, amazing food and Good Value for Money.  Must-Try Dish : Dal Makhni  , Murgh Chatkori and Ajwain Fish Tikka  Food- 4/5  Ambience - 3/5.  Service - 4/5.  Parking Space - 1/5."
4.0,"There are many places in Bangalore which will use the word ""Punjab"" but they have no clue about Punjabi food. But Zero Mile Punjab definitely knows what food means in Punjab and they have done a good job in replicating the same in Bangalore. The moment you enter the place you will get enchanted by the smell of the spices and definitely the butter. It is maintained by an uncleji and his son who they treat you as a personal guest. We reached around 9 o clock on a Sunday night and the place was absolutely jam packed. We had to wait for 30 odd minutes before we got our table. Even though it's a rooftop don't go for the ambiance of the place since it is just average. But I can definitely guarantee that you will love the food here. We ordered Murg Chatkora ( you just can't afford to miss this) which was simply insane and  Sultaani seekh which was good as starters. For main course we had the Murgh Tikka Masala and RaDa Murgh. The latter was something different which I had never tasted and along with the chicken pieces chicken keema was mixed in the gravy. We also had Mango lassi and buttermilk ( again out if the world), but unfortunately before we could order the second round they were out of it. Tandoori rotis and jeera rice were decent. One of the best part is value for money and the total bill for 7 of us came as 1700 only!!! Service can be improved and also on weekends they should take the orders atleast till 11. Highly recommended!"
3.0,"Both my experiences with the place has been in home delivery. What worked and didn't were the same both times.  What worked was the food: I don't remember the 1 item ordered the first time..it was very tasty though! The second time around (yesterday), we ordered Murgh lahsooni tikka, Paneer Makhni, Murgh methi malai, Tawa roti. Without getting into too much details, every item was very tasty. The tikka was soft and well marinated, the makhni was a good balance of slightly pungent and sweet, the murgh curry was creamy and the rotis were soft. Yes, it was oily..because of which there was a mild aftertaste for a while. But let's face it, we don't look for health & sophistication in ""dhaba"" food, upmarket or otherwise!  What didn't work (BOTH times) was the billing: During the first order, when I asked for the bill amount, I was told a figure higher than what I saw in the zomato menu. However, an explanation was provided and that worked for me. The delivery guy came and quoted an even higher amount, which didn't work for me. Since he claimed to be in a hurry, my expected bill amount was accepted. Yesterday, when I asked for the bill amount on the phone, I was told an sms with this information would be sent. What I got was a total bill amount, which was 130 bucks higher than my expectation (again, based on zomato menu). Now I understand that revised prices and taxes may be an explanation for the difference. However, the lack of transparency is shady. My suggestion is (if AT ALL the menu has revised prices) provide the updated one. Also, give a breakdown of the bill AND A RECEIPT.  Would I order again? I am undecided..the food tempts, the shady billing doesn't."
4.0,"Visited this place for farewell of one of my friend. Nice place for dinner. You can have chicken murgh in starters, dal makhani is awesome.  You can have one of the best north Indian food here.  Pocket friendly also.  We got stuck in lift for few minutes so don't use elevator there with more that three people,"
4.0,"You cant really go wrong with a semi open restaurent, authentic punjabi food and simple ambiance. Not only is the food so great, they also have some unique desi drinks as well. Only couple of negatives I found, both related to facilities at the restaurant. One, there is only a small sink to wash hands, and usually this place is full at lunch time, causing queues at the open sink. Bigger problem if its raining outside. Second, as it is situated at roof top, you are likely to take elevator but the elevator is tiny and has capacity of 3 person at a time. Need to wait for your turn.  But overall, great food and full value for money."
3.5,"Sunday dinner with family usually takes us to classic Punjabi places. I'd heard good things about this place, so we went ahead to give it a shot. Read on for a thorough review.  PARKING & ENTRY - 3/5 - They don't really have a parking as such, and the street on which the restaurant is present has only no parking signs. Look for parking in nearby lanes. You've to take a lift up 4 floors, and then climb a set of stairs. The lift is simply flimsy, though we cannot fault the restaurant for the same.  RESERVATION & SEATING - 2/5 - They don't take bookings, and we waited about 30 mins to get a table. Only plastic chairs are available to sit.  EXPERIENCE & AMBIENCE - 3/5 - The people and friendly, but the ambience needs a little work. No music. FOOD - 4.5/5 - You have to taste it to believe it. The place has excellant paneer Kadhai and the chiken starters are yummy. EXPENSE - 4.5/5 - Let the numbers do the talking. We paid Rs. 902 for 4 people. Enough said."
4.5,"Visited Zero Mile Punjab for team lunch. On a day of mild rain,endless traffic and a hungry stomach we came to this place with decent expectation. The ambience is nothing to write home about. The washroom is not well maintained and the handwash is a hard find. The food on the other hand was completely different. Having had some of the best Punjabi food in Delhi and Chandigarh, many of the restaurants serving Punjabi food always fell short of my expectations. They never taste the same. But 0 Mile Punjab was an absolute delight. The food was authentic, fresh and good portions. Punjabi paneer Tikka was the highlight among the starters. Hariyali chicken was good too. The bread was well cooked and the curries had the right flavors. Dal makhani was the best I have had in Bangalore. But the Nawabi sabjee slammed the home run for all of us.Loved the mango Lassi too. For batch of 7 the bill seemed little less than what it would cost in most other restaurants. To sum up 0 Mile Punjab is a pocket friendly joint that serves authentic Punjabi cuisine. They have earned a repeat customer in me."
5.0,We were in HSR and looking g for a decent restaurant for Lunch... Good reviews on Zomato took us to 0 mile Punjab :)  I must say the food was Awesome!  The owner was very generous and helped us to place our order.  Though we were only able to try Veg delicacy our taste buds were satisfied ..  Am surely gonna visit soon to try their famous Non Veg items...
4.5,Zero Mile Punjab is perhaps one of the best restaurant I have visited in Bangalore. Everything in this restaurant falls in place. From ambiance to food. Four of us went for lunch and the food was delicious!! Every single order served had sumptuous taste and worth eating. Great job guys!! Thanks for the delicious meal.  Ambience : 3.5/5  Food: 4.5/5  Service 4/5  Value for money: 4.5/5
5.0,"We came to this place fearing if we will be able to experience good punjabi food or again will have to go back disappointed but the moment we entered @5th floor and saw the ambience we got kinda convinced it will b hellova evng.. The food was tasty and served with attention though it was a busy day for the waiters. 4 ppl and we ate starters, main course and dessert.  Total bill around Rs. 1200/- and we enjoyed indeed!!"
4.0,"The restaurant is in HSR, i had few hiccups to find the place although the restaurant is just on service road. Ambience : 3.5/5 Food: 4.5/5 Service 3.5/5 Value for money: 4/5  The place has decent ambienece and amazing food. Please try their daal makhni, it was one of the best daal makhni i have ever had.  The only negative thing i faced was when i checked my bill today, i feel like cheated by the management as i was overcharged. On checking my bill today, i found that i was charged for one more item which i never ordered. I wasn't able to check it at that time as the people were waiting for seats and the management told me that please pay and leave. Even there was no finger bowl bno sweet nothing, the guy came and showed me the bill in his hand, i paid and left.  I feel, the management could have been more professional but otherwise i loved the place, i will surely recommend this place and will visit back."
4.0,"We went here on a Sunday night, and there was a short wait to get the table. We ordered a full chicken chatkhora, which 3 of us struggled to finish. Its a huge portion. But we didn't mind because it is absolutely delicious. Its a must try for all the medium spicy chicken lovers. We were so full that we had our main course packed to go. It was a good dinner, but not such a great dining experience. There were 2-3 servers for a crowded Sunday night. And we had to wait patiently for 5 minutes for water. Then the next 5 waiting for the glass. But, if you love your chicken then head to this place."
4.0,"We went to zero miles on weekends. Food is really good. I loved their Paneer kastoori tikka and malai kofta. However, I feel it is little pricey wrt to their ambiance and quality of plates and spoon used. Ambiance has dhaba look. Table and chair also not very good. For food I will give this rating."
3.5,Place is decent ... Food is actually good but slightly expensive... Methi chicken and amritsari kulcha is my personal fav....On lazy evening really good option for dinner.
5.0,"awesome destination who loves truly North Indian food. I had Bhuna chicken and butter naan, it's really yummy.  Go n explore your desired food."
4.5,Nice cozy ambience.... The owner is a nice guy and was easily approachable.. Food was really good.... Easily recommended to others.... Will come back again definitely.
5.0,"We miss you so much in Electronic City ZMP :-( :-(  Amazing food served with love and smile :-) The paneer here is the best in Bangalore I feel, it is just so perfect! For Food, I think the complete menu(all the VEG and NON-VEG dishes) gets 4.5 Star overall ... and now , you have an awesome ambiance too!!!"
4.5,"Had mutter paneer and phulka here. Was perfect to my craving of home food - non oily, correct level of spice, and tasty. Staff was friendly too. But their lassi wasn't so great. Still, 4.5 for the ghar-ki- sabji taste !"
4.0,"Loved to see a place which focuses mainly on the food quality and taste! And at a reasonable price! Ambience and location are descent, seemingly only because the focus is mainly on making authentic punjabi food!  Had murgha makhani with kulchha and absolutely loved it. Totally recommended at this price range."
3.5,"oye hoye! that's what the expression came out after having the first bite of murgh makhni here. I've never had such tender cooked chicken here in Bangalore before. Tasty food, decent(read rustic) ambience, superfast service, and just enough pocket friendly to visit often. Recommended if you are looking for quick punjabi dhabe wala khana. Not recommended if you like your food to be served in glass plates and you expect a finger bowl at the end of your finger licking meal!!!"
4.5,"Don't know why I have not visited this place earlier. One of the best place for great food. Its a roof top restaurant on 5th floor with lift upto 4th floor. They have variety of paneer dishes and Tawa roti is awesome. They don't serve soup but don't skip the starters. I have also tried their dal palak, very tasty. Variety of lassi is not something to avoid. Place is always crowded for weekends for lunch and dinner, you have to wait. Ensure you reach the place little early or opt for take away. Only reason to reduce .5 is for ambience, its very average in look. Service is ok. No exclusive parking but you can find parking in service road."
5.0,"This place is located on the terrace and hence provides a rooftop ambiance. We ordered the Murgh Chatkori for starter. It was one of the best dish we ever had... the chicken was tender and the taste mind-blowing. It was so good that we ordered it again (first time ever did I order the same starter again.) Then we had the Murgh Tikka masala along with Roti and Phulka, which also was amazing. Had the Mango lassi which was quite thick and good. The service was nice. Not at all expensive.  Plenty of parking space.  Absolutely no complaints. Hands down, the best Punjabi restaurant i have been to."
4.5,"One of the best punjabi joints in town . Being a foodie and having stayed in Delhi for past many months , I can say this place comes the closest to true Delhi punjabi taste. Chicken starters are very good and so are the main dishes. Yet light on pocket. Hope they will maintain the quality in times to come."
4.0,"This place has always been on my wishlist since it's inception. It is located at 5th floor and the place is very airy. The ambience is decent and seating arrangement with space allocated for waiting too. I ordered sultan seekh kabab, dal tadka, methi Malai paneer and butter milk. The butter milk tasted good but was way too cold. Seekh kabab were cooked perfectly and stuffed with cheese. It was the best part of the dinner. Methi Malai paneer was also good and tasted quite different from regular paneer dishes. I was little disappointed with the dal tadka though. Even my cook makes a better dal tadka than the one I had here. Anyway it could also be one of those bad dal days. I will definitely come back again to try some chicken main course. And for once the bill exactly matched to what zomato has suggested ie. 700 for 2 people.  Food - 4/5 VFM - 4/5 Ambiance - 2.5/5"
4.0,"Delicious food but slow service. I have been there more than 5 times and never have I been disappointed by the quality of food. However, there is a serious resource crunch and it takes around 30-45 mins minimum before you get your order. Most of the times, I was so hungry that the mice inside my stomach died of hunger. But since the food is tasty , I go there often . Additionally , I personally dislike their plastic crockery as it feels like a canteen and not like a roof top restaurant."
4.5,This place is awesome.   They've got authentic Punjabi food. Amazing paneer tikka. Great rotis and awesome main course gravy.   A place you must visit.
4.0,"Have been here a couple of times now. the shikanji is really good and so are the veg starters. Had the chicken tangri, paneer tikka. Very Delhi style in their preparation. For the main course had dal makhani, matter paneer and chicken tikka masala which were good as well. The place is new and is owned by a father-son pair who own a place in e-city. Nice option for office goers in HSR layout who are craving for some good north Indian food. The only negative is that they don't give finger bowls :("
4.5,"4 points for food and additional 0.5 for the awesome Bangalore weather. Open air restaurant on the fifth floor with basic setting and forgetful and very sweet owner. We had tandoori chicken (very good), kebabs (good), and chicken tikka masala (awesome). The bread served was fine but mango lassi was a let down. Reasonably priced and courteous staff."
2.0,"Good food, Value for money, decent ambience but the service is at the rate of ""zero miles per house"", had to wait for almost 30min for the starters and 45min for the main course to be served.  Value for Money : 5  Ambience : 4  Food : 4  Service : 1"
2.0,"Three of us went at around 9:30PM on a Friday night.   For starters, we had Masala Papad (good), chaach (good), their famous chicken chatkora (pathetic, sweet, uncooked), malai tikka (decent, partly frozen but tasted better).   When the starters were so disappointing, we were struggling to find a main course dish. It was like a game of Russian roulette. We settled on their famous Murgh Punjabi (gravy filled with capsicum, onions, garlic and chicken was uncooked). Most of all, it tasted really bad.  Even the onions that they served with the food had some weird marination on top that made them taste sweet. Why the hell is everything so sweet here?  Our decision for going here was based purely on the reviews on Zomato. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a disappointing night for us.  Please note that all the dishes that we ordered had already been ordered by people in the reviews before. Maybe, we've just eaten better Punjabi food."
5.0,"It's a fairly new place with amazing food. We ordered kasturi paneer starters. The paneer was soft creamy and beautifully stuffed. The sabji. Shikanji n rotis were perfectly cooked. We also did ordered chicken tikka, murg makhni, roti and lassi. Everything was good with special mention to chicken tikka with was really very tasty. The ambiance is decent and the staff is very nice.  Would definitely recommend this place for nice north Indian food."
4.5,"When you consider the restaurant solely from food perspective it is a perfect 5. We had Murgh Chatkora for starters and Ajwain Paratha, Amritsari kulcha, ZMP Special Murgh for main course. But the ambience is not all that appealing although no specific complaints."
3.0,"Pretty average Punjabi food. Please don't have high expectations.   We had hariyali chicken, fish amritsari, stuffed breads, zero mile spl chicken curry.. All were average. Paneer paratha and hariyali chicken were a little better"
3.0,"A fine dinner after a long time. I got to know about the place under trending places in zomato. It was nearby so gave it a try. The place is well located. It's on a roof of a building which is well covered with lightings to give it a Punjabi dhaba feeling. The ambience could have been better with some Punjabi music. No doubt the food is awesome with good variety of veg and non-veg food, be it starter or curries. Some more options could have been added. Beverages like lassi and sikhanji gave a Punjabi feeling with paneer tikka and of course chicken tikka in non-veg. The service is bit poor and the presentation too does not carry the mark. The owner is a caring man making sure we get a good meal. Good place for a hangout and a proper meal."
2.5,"By the ambiance and location wise this restaurant appeals many and does justice as well.now lets come down to food For starters we ordered chicken chatkora and in veg some vegetable gilafi seekh(mind you i was having loads of expectation from ZMP given i followed the rating and review before visiting) Chatkora was ok with mild sweetness nothing extraordinary,coming to veg gilafi it was minced vegetables packed with unnecessary high dose of garam masala that has taken up the taste of the rest vegetables in the dish ,,,we were able to hardly finish that dish totally thumbs down .  Coming to main dish Amritsari kofta and ZMP chikcen masala was ordered w.r.t to kofta chicken masla was ok but not really a typical punjabi taste along with butter tandoori on which there was hardly any butter applied :( aftre that the biggest let down of the evening we ordered that was peas rice that was cooked in too much of vegetable oil not even ghee we can taste the rawness of oil while eating.  If it wound not been a punjabi restaurant probably i wont be dissatisfied but punjabi food itself has very high own standard which i feel ZMP will have to ramp up big time to achieve that.  one suggestion the management must engage with the customer in real time to have the feedback  good for one time but not that really great"
4.0,"Went here today with 4 of my frnds.  Didn't want to go far so was searching something good in hsr only.  Then found this which was very near and very good rating. When reached there it was completly full and almost 1 hour waiting.  After long wait, got a table.  Too muchhh crowdyy it was.  Ordered some starters of paneer and one kebab kind,  both were very tasty.  In main course punjabi mushroom,  daal tadka in desi ghee and paneer lahori and amritsari kulcha.  Foood was very delicious.  Then we wanted to order lassi,  bt it was over. Bt then they arranged it somehow for us. So overall enjoyed the punjabi food."
5.0,"Authenticity of being a punjabi all reflects in foods. I am really happy that this kind of punjabi resraura also exists in Hsr, really gone mad after having the foods. The foods were so yummy that you cant prevent yourself from ordering one more. Ajwan paratha was really good, full crunchy, the seekh was amazing and the tandoori, you must try, was away from obvious. It was so soft that one will really enjoy it. Went on a weekday, not crowdy but service is good. Due to have a small kitchen sometime they struggle but really pocket friendly and the waiter's are really polite and well mannered. Would love to go one more time.."
1.0,I would start by saying the food was really bad. We ordered chicken chatkora for snacks. I could see raw oil that too sarso ka tel ki smell and taste in the chicken. For main course we ordered rada murg and one panner ki sabji. There was water flowing out of rada murk which was again yellow gravy. We ordered lachha prantha for breads and we were given tawa pranthas. The sardarji was adamant and unapologetic saying its like that only here. Which was very strange. Overall experience was bad. I would never come again or recommend an1 to come.
4.5,"Coming to food we ordered - kumbh lazeez for starters, perfectly marinated mushroom flowers served with green chutney. Loved it. Next came tawa rotis n paneer tikka masala, rotis were soft. Curry was tasty n delicious n enough for 2!!! Starters and Main course is great. Must have is Tandoori chicken Paneer kastoori, lahori Paneer and murgh bhuna. High time recommended."
4.5,Definitely a must visit restaurant around HSR layout! Food is yummy and the hospitality and ambience is decent. Both non- veg and veg is good and Mango lassi is just delicious! Loved the value for money!!
4.0,"A must visit place. Menu is small, but food is awesome, price is appreciable. Ambience is fine,but food quantity & quality with price is worth visit. Suggest to improve on oil quantity a little bit,of course Punjabi food u cant go without oil."
4.5,"Had a dinner on Sunday night. # Place and Ambience - Really good. It's on the rooftop and is open on the sides. So, good breeze in the evening. # Food - Value for money!# Service - There was a little waiting time to enter (owing to the time at which we went - around 8:30 PM) but the actual service was quick."
4.5,"A typical punjabi restaurant situated in a quite area of hsr , next to janani travels, easily accessible from ORR. Parking not a problem.  We have ordered chicken tikka, murg makhni, roti and lassi. Everything was good with special mention to chicken tikka with was really very tasty. The ambiance is decent and the staff is very nice. Must have is Tandoori chicken Paneer kastoori, lahori Paneer and murgh bhuna. High time recommended.  Would definitely recommend this place for nice north Indian food."
3.5,"It was rainy evening when we decided to try something new from our own HSR, This restaurant came in zomato list.  Was Surprised to see the rating, decided try out this Punjabi restaurant, called up to order food.Due to rain their delivery was not there.   Ordered the food saying that we will pick it up from restaurant. It is a roof top restaurant in outer ring road towards silk board. We decided to order few chicken starters and Roti and Curry for nonveg. Murgh chatkora was exceptional in taste but tangdee kabab was kind off dry not up to the mark .May be expectations were more after lip smacking chatkora. Murgh Malai kabab was good.  Coming to main course disappoint with the quality and taste of Daal tadka. Curries were best complementing the rotis.  Good food,Value for money,need improvement on few dishes.                                                                 eattravelcapture.wordpress.com"
3.5,"Zero Mile Punjab is good restaurant. Being vegetarians, we ordered Tandoori Gobi for starter and Paneer do pyaja and butter naan. We also ordered Roohhafza Lassi and also Punjabi rice. Taste was good. Below is the rating for all items and ambiance and service etc etc.  Tandoori Gobhi - 4.5, Paneer do pyaza - 3.5, Butter Naan - 3.5 and Lassi - 4.0, Rice - 3.0 (Taste was good but there was lot of oil and no salt)  Ambiance - 3.5  Service - 3.0  Overall - 3.5  Actually we went there at 8pm. As it was Sunday, we know that it would be crowded. So waited for 10 mins to get a table. I still need to say this that they need to develop in service as they are really in hurry burry and couldn't manage when there is more crowd in restaurant. For example, we went first. We ordered first but the people who came later us, got served first and finished first and left. So for Zero mile Punjab management, i wanted to say that you need to improve in concentrating first come first serve. Rest was ok. I am planning to try this in weekdays and wanted to see whether the service would be same even in weekdays or not. Waiters couldn't arrange for even salt These all needs to be improved. They were busy in attending new customers who are occupying the table newly and they  are ignoring the people who are already at table and started eating.  Waiters are also in hurry burry and i had to call them lot more times just to get my LASSI. I got just my LASSI 20 mins later we ordered. I can understand for tandoori items it may take some time. But it should be same with all the customers. They are confused with who came first whom to serve first. Customers need attention first than food. So try improving this. We got our table at 8.15pm and we ended up at 9.45. There was huge crowd near billing also.  So try to improve in that so that it will be easy for customers also not to wait near bill counter.   Service need to be improved a lot. Rest all is decent. Food is good."
4.5,"Glad they have opened in HSR as well... Since the office have moved to Bellandur, team was bit sad to miss Zero the real hero... Good food great people the Father Son Jodi..."
4.0,We went for sunday lunch. Thebplace is cery casual and feel like a dhaba ...normal tables in a straight rows.. It was almost full.. We ordered paneer n bjuna chkn. Khasta and nan.. Must say paneer was very delicious...very soft paneer..and tatsy gravy...bhuna chkn was also good.. We ordered for lassi..n that was a simple lassi as u normaly get in dhabas...no over seasoning of dry fruits etc... Liked the food and service.. Recommended
2.0,It was a late night dinner order and wish I hadn't picked this place. First of all they did not have everything on the menu available. Moreover the rotis were fat and had to be pulled from either end of the table. The rice tasted bad. The curry tasted bad too. The only good thing was the kebab. I don't think I'll even consider trying again.
4.5,Awesome food loved the buttermilk.  Mango and pain Lassi.  Tandoori chicken with Tandoori roti.  The list goes on kids loved the butter chicken and butter Naan.  Rara murgh.  A must try for Punjabi food lovers.  Feels like home.
5.0,Excellent food with more than a generous quantity. Staff was very polite and friendly. Ambience is decent. Overall food is the real clincher here. We had ordered Paneer Malai Tikka and Cauliflower/Broccoli tandoori as starters. Dal Makhani and Paneer methi malai along with roti and rice as main course. It was very good! Nice succulent paneer with a lip smacking green chutney. Dal Makhani was very tasty too. Will surely recommend.
4.5,"This place is located on the ORR towards the HSR after BDA complex. Restaurant is on the 5th floor and can easily be seen from the Serivce road. Ambience is simple and well lit to suit a typical dhaba kind of environment and 'zero mile' in the restaurant name suggests that you have reached Punjab for food. Even seating and tables match to that of a dhaba meme. The owner had been service oriented and courteous, he was the person who picked our orders and had ensured that everything is served within the quickest possible time. Coming to food we ordered - kumbh lazeez for starters, perfectly marinated mushroom flowers served with green chutney. Loved it. The Punjabi paneer tikka is to die for. The maethi kulcha was also pretty amazing. A must try if you like Punjabi food!!!!"
5.0,"If u r looking for Punjabi food then go to zero mile punjab..  Food was awesome....... :) Really i felt m in punjab.... Keep it up guys.... And lassi was also very tasty...We had achari bhindi,  amritsari Kulcha,"
4.0,"A very nice place for the family, Good food place with good taste. Healthy food with sufficient quantity Ambience is very decent and normal Service is also quite good with Reasonable rates Must try - Achari bhindi and Ajwain paratha"
3.5,"Roof top dinner place. I have tried Punjabi style paneer tikka, amritsari kofta, falooda, chicken malai tikka, rada murgh, chicken chatkora, shikanji, butter milk. Note visit only in weekdays then only u will get the treaty food he is having very less staff to prepare. All are nice. Last Saturday was over crowded the taste of the food had gone to toss."
5.0,"Made visit with full family and everyone walked out satisfied with taste, quantity and bill  keep up! Wait was definitely worth and hospitality was warm."
4.5,"This place has got some of the best chicken cooked in Punjabi style. Their ZMP special chicken is awesome. And their Aloo Onion cheese parathas are a must try. If you like punjabi food, you ought to visit this place."
2.0,"I am a guy from south India.I like to visit restaurants and I am used to it.So I am writing this review based on my experience. We went to zero mile punjab(HSR Layout) for a team lunch. First of all, I didn't like its ambience. It is located in between two drainage river(one in front and another one on its side). So we got some foul smell. The restaurant is on the fifth floor.Thankfully, lift facility was there, provided only three can enter at a time. We were a group of 20.So we used stairs. Washroom facility is too bad.Only one wash basin for entire restaurant. We reached restaurant by 12:45. Many items in the menu were not available. Even desserts too were not available. Serving is too slow to be honest. We were out by 3:45, that is too much(I am not going for team lunch for the first time). Coming to the food, all the starters(non veg) tasted similar. Quantity was too less.Main course was ok.  The person who served was good. The only thing which I liked here.  It was a waste of MONEY and TIME coming here for team lunch."
4.5,"Oh i love this new place. The best tandoori i have had in Bangalore so far.We tried the murg chatkora and tangeeri kabab, and both were out of this world. Although my personal favourite was murg chatkora. It was incomparably juicy, very flavourful with an intense hit of smoke. Can't wait to be there again!!!"
4.0,Its at the roof of a building and gives the feel of dhaba (if they would have been on the roof :P). Very limited in terms of space but cannot say the same for the variety of dishes available. Starters were tasty so was the main course.
4.5,"This place is located on the ORR towards the HSR after BDA complex. Restaurant is on the 5th floor and can easily be seen from the Serivce road. Coming to food we ordered - kumbh lazeez for starters, perfectly marinated mushroom flowers served with green chutney. Loved it. Next came tawa rotis n paneer tikka masala, rotis were soft. Curry was tasty n delicious n enough for 2. Pricing is very reasonable.. all these came for around 500-600. Overall a nice north indian restaurant !!!!"
4.5,One of the best Punjabi Restaurants in Bangalore. Non Veg dishes were super good and lassi was just fantastic. Location is decent. Do visit this place once!
4.5,The food is really yum! A simple but nice ambience! Great food and pretty quick service makes it a nice evening dinner place.   Value for Money : 5 Ambience : 4 Food : 4 Service : 5
4.5,"Veg Review: Ordered Dal Makhani, Kadai Vegetables, Kulcha and Taandoori Roti. The curry quantity is enough for 3 people. After getting bored with Punjabi Rasoi, this was a refreshing taste. The Nikhanji that they have is not the usual Nimbu Shikanji but kind of sweet Aam paani. Go for good food not ambience."
4.0,"We were just browsing through the newest restaurants opened in HSR and one's which had better rating of atleast 4 and above, and ultimately we down selected this restaurant which is actually a complete Punjabi food fare. This place is situated on the terrace of a high rise building which has been customised to suit the perfection. We reached the place at 7:45 pm and found couple of tables already being occupied. Since we were a group of 10 ppl, they were courteous enough to adjoin 2-3 tables. Ambience is simple and well lit to suit a typical dhaba kind of environment and 'zero mile' in the restaurant name suggests that you have reached Punjab for food. Even seating and tables match to that of a dhaba meme. The owner had been service oriented and courteous, he was the person who picked our orders and had ensured that everything is served within the quickest possible time. All the non veg and veg starters tasted really good with slight Punjab tinge into it. Main course had butter tandoori rotis and few non veg and veg curries. Non veg curries had some spiciness into it which was to the expectations of our taste buds but the veg curries tasted slightly sweet which few of them didn't enjoy it. I wanted to specially mention about the lassi - it was an absolute fantastic experience having lassi here, after so many months I had the best of lassi's I would say. Overall it has been a wonderful food experience here and it is pocket friendly too with cost for two hovering around Rs. 650."
4.0,"We went for dinner to this place located next to NH7 in HSR. The ambience is nothing great but the food is. Starters and main course were delicious. Do try chicken chatkori and Punjabi paneer. Lassi was the usual. Overall, pocket friendly with great taste."
5.0,Amazing food. Great prices. The Punjabi paneer tikka is to die for. The maethi kulcha was also pretty amazing. A must try if you like Punjabi food.
3.5,Visited this place with office colleagues for lunch. Delighted to have typical Punjabi food. The staffs are polite but service was slow. We were a big group so that might be the reason. The price is also very much pocket friendly.  would like to visit again.
5.0,It's a fairly new place with amazing food. We ordered kasturi paneer starters. The paneer was soft creamy and beautifully stuffed. The sabji. Shikanji n rotis were perfectly cooked. Super polite staff. Very sweet owner. Totally recommended
5.0,"Awesome yummy food. Good quantity too. The service is slightly on the slow side, but it's not a problem. The starters are very filling and I like eating the jaggery at the billing counter."
4.0,"This place is located on the ORR towards the HSR after BDA complex.  Went with group of 15 members. Restaurant is on the 5th floor and can easily be seen from the Serivce road.  We reached there at 1:00pm. Ambiance is pretty decent Dhaba style with thatched mats covering the perimeter. Coming to food I would say we tried almost all the signature dishes and frankly they were outstanding.  In starters we took Murgh Chatkora which was the tangy version of tandoori chicken but a bit less spicy.  Kalmi Kabab and Tangdee Kabab were cooked very well. In veg we tried out kumbh lazeez and Sultani Aaloo which had rich Stuffing of potatoes. In main course we took punjabi chicken, Murgh punjabi Masala, murg khada Masala, ZMP special Murgh and punjabi paneer. All these were too good except punjabi paneer in which the essence of red chilly powder was more may be because of uncooked spices.  For drinks we took Lassi , shikanji , Pudina pani. Lassi lacked the authentic taste of punjab. The flavour of roo-afja on top of Lassi was not liked much.  Coming to service, starters took more than 20 mins which was acceptable(upto a limit) as they need to prepare the chicken Kabab. Main course was on time.. Overall service was good. A special note of thanks to the owner who was round our table from the start till end suggesting us for what all to try and asking about our feedback.  At the end we were given complimentary Rasgulla which was liked by everyone in the team.  Overall rating  Look and feel (ambiance): 4/5 Food : 4.5/5 Value for money:4/4 Service: 4/5  Kuddos to ZMP team.. I would be happy to come here again but this time for sure with less crowd"
3.5,"A very nice value for money place with good food. Came to know about this place here in Zomato only so we decided to come here for dinner.  We have ordered chicken tikka, murg makhni, roti and lassi. Everything was good with special mention to chicken tikka with was really very tasty. The ambiance is decent and the staff is very nice.  Would definitely recommend this place for nice north Indian food."
5.0,"been here for the first time......desi ghee dal tadka is the best daal i had in recent past... gooood fooooood.,, great service.... must try..."
2.5,"Poor Service. Poor ambience. Overall poo management. Only Decent thing was Food, with good quantity and ok taste. Giving 2.5 for food and thus a decent option for delivery."
3.5,"Had dinner with family today, it is located on 5th floor and easy to locate. Normal set up, had buttermilk (Very good) & pudine ka paani (OK, needs more tanginess) in beverages. Starters were paneer kastoori tikka & murgh chatkora - both were nicely cooked. Main course was dal desi ghee tadka (good) & nawabi murgh (OK, chicken cut was not up to the mark) with tawa roti and tandoori roti. It was getting crowded by the time we finished our meal. Service needs improvement. Overall, not a bad place to try."
3.5,"This is place is new to HSR. They have moved from E-City. My friend used to dine here when he was there. It is an ordinary eat out place. We ordered Murgh Malai Tikka, Peshwari Murgh, Roti and Kulcha. Also tried their Lassi. I was not impressed with the food. I only like their Malai Tikka. Service was satisfactory. I felt it a bit overpriced for the kind of place and food. You can always give a try. !"
4.5,"Visited this for the first time, it's newly opened punjabi place in HSR Layout. - Awesome food - Great service - Only vat applicable bill :)"
4.0,Good Punjabi food.. the owner himself look after us.. nice staff.. ambience is also nice small and peaceful place..the food was also reasonably priced
4.5,"Great service , different food ,total Punjab flavour with lassi n butter milk.We ordered  chat pata chicken n chicken makhani ,it was great in taste .A place you can visit to ve fell of proper north Indian food"
4.0,"A typical punjabi restaurant situated in a quite area of hsr , next to janani travels, easily accessible from ORR. Parking not a problem. When we went there it wasn't crowded, 8.15 to be precise, guess coz of IPL final. Coming to food we ordered - kumbh lazeez for starters, perfectly marinated mushroom flowers served with green chutney. Loved it. Next came tawa rotis n paneer tikka masala, rotis were soft. Curry was tasty n delicious n enough for 2. Sweet lassi was very normal, definitely not typical punjabi types. What pissed me off was flies n insects as we got into the lift from ground floor. It was pathetic. Restaurant actually is close to hsr drainage/ lake which stinks. Well, it's definitely VFM. Cost for 2 came up to be 630/- including vat."
4.0,"Zero reads the milestone-as you enter Punjab (in this case the restaurant) on the 5th floor of a building on the service lane of HSR parallel to ORR. The lift is till 4th followed by stairs till 5th.  Experience the open breezy roof top space overlooking the outer ring road with a very basic punjabi decor and still a very nice feel to it. The space is small with limited seats & the staff is on the toes almost running and attending every guest ensuring the service is flawless.  We tried Murg chatkora, Paneer lababdaar, Murg Makhni, Tawa butter roti, Aloo pyaz paratha, Shikanji and Chaas. While Murg chatkora and Paneer lababdaar were really one of the best, Murg makhani was sweet and wasn't close to the authentic one and the Paratha had the filling sandwiched between 2 rotis unlike the original one. I liked the beverages though and also the Roti(made of wheat flour )-same as how we make at home.  Staff was super quick and extremely humble. Would like to visit again."
5.0,Awesome food......i tried all items.....goood in taste.......... Staff is very cooperative Butter naan are really fantastic Chicken chaatkora also good Nawabi murgh really nice
5.0,"Went to this place on 3 occasions and love the food absolutely. Starters and Main course is great. Must have is Tandoori chicken Paneer kastoori, lahori Paneer and murgh bhuna. High time recommended."
1.5,Had a very bad experience... Dont know why people have given it high ratings... Went for lunch there... The service is very poor and too much slow...the food we ordered came in one hour... And when we complained to the owner... He didn't accept his mistake... He was telling to be practical and was telling to have patience as it takes time to cook food.. We were like.. We are not eating in a restaurant for the first time.... And the food which we ordered was not good at all....so if you have at least  two hours of time to eat food... Then you can go there....
4.0,"Ambience is decent. Reminds of open air Dhabas in Punjab. We were 3 people and we ate our hearts out. Tangree Kebab is a must. It simply melts in the mouth. Very tasty. Veg food is decent too, but nowhere near the non vegetarian dishes. It was approx 450 per head for us. That was pretty decent given the gluttonous quantity we ordered ."
4.0,"Authentic punjabi taste and authentic punjabi service. Came here a group of 13 for my sons birthday. The stArters distracted me from all conversation. The Sultani aloo just melts in your mouth and the chatkora chicken has just the right blend of hot and sweet. Food comes across as made with passion and sincerity. Overall, its a pretty reasonable and good place to go."
4.0,"This place was a random try out for us, but it fulfilled out punjabi craving!! Friendly staff. Enjoyed the peshawari gravy i tried, and even the lassi was pretty good! Tasty food for a price that's worth it!   Have to add, the gravy's here are extremely flavorful! I enjoy coming here"
4.0,"Visited zero miles punjab yesterday for lunch. We were quite early to reach sharp at 12 when the restaurant opened so it was empty at that time. Located in the 5th floor of a building in service road off ORR. There is a lift till the 4th floor of the building. The ambience was really nice and clean. We ordered rooafza lassi,pudina ka paani,tandoori murg,amritsari naan,tandoori roti and punjabi paneer. I liked the lassi,amritsari naan and paneer the most. The tandoori murg was good but very very spicy. Could have toned down a bit on the spice level. Quantity of the dishes were huge so order accordingly. Pricing is very reasonable.. all these came for around 500-600. Overall a nice north indian restaurant"
4.0,"This place defines VFM!! Great food at very reasonable prices.  It's located on the rooftop of a converted residential building, on the service road, off ORR . This seems to be the trend in HSR nowadays. It's compact place, with lotsa tables thrown in, with little gap in between. But hey, with the amount of crowd they cater to, they need to cram in those tables, or else there will be long waiting lines. And when you're hungry, and can smell awesome food in the air, you do not want to wait, right??  The place has a cute, quaint feel to it, with bamboo chick blinds, cute fairy lights, multicolored pillars with potted plants, and basic wood furniture. Each table has a nice plastic bottle of cool water already kept on it, which in my opinion, gives it a good touch.  When we arrived at 9:30 PM on a Sunday night, the place was packed. We shared a long table with another family, but didn't mind cuz we were famished, and the air was thick with yummy masala smells.  We ordered the Shikanjee to drink, Tandoori Phool in starters, Amristsari Kofta & Peshawari Murgh in the main course, and Ajwain paratha and Butter Tawa roti.  The Shikanjee arrived in a glass jar (as is the trend nowadays), and was just about ok. Definite room for improvement. The masalas were all settled in at the bottom, and it wasn't sweet enough. A touch of Elaichi, and some more sugar would have done wonders to the drink. But it wasn't bad..  Then arrived our starter - Tandoori Phool, which was a combination of Broccoli and Cauliflower florets marinated in spicy hung curd. It was delicious, with the hung curd providing the right amount of sourness, and the accompanied onions adding a nice crunch to the whole dish. But Spice alert!! This dish was super spicy, and had my taste buds on fire!! But I loved it anyway. It did not need the green pudina chutney that it came with. And I would've loved it even more, if it had been all Broccoli, and no Cauliflower. :)  For our main course, the owner of the place came up and informed me that both the curries that we'd ordered would have a similar taste, and since I wanted only boneless chicken (they have only 3 boneless dishes), I went for the Labaabdaar Mugh. I really liked the personal touch shown by the owner, to care enough to come and recommend that we go for something else. Kudos!!  The butter tawa rotis were nice and big, the kind of rotis you have at home, but with a generous amount of butter. :). The Ajwain Paratha was very nice and khasta, and quite big as well.  The Amritsari kofta gravy had 2 big koftas in a rich, mild, slightly sweet gravy. The koftas had a generous amount of paneer, and the texture was fabulous!! The slight sweetness in the gravy wrapped up the whole dish in a wonderful manner.  The Labaabdaar Murgh, was tasty as well, with small chicken pieces in a rich, mildly spicy gravy.  The portions of all the dishes were very generous.  So for 1 drink, 1 veg starter, 1 veg gravy, 1 non veg gravy, 2 big Ajwain Parathas, and 2 big butter tawa rotis, our bill came up to INR 777. Amazingly reasonable for generous quantities of delicious food.  I suspect this place is going to be our go-to place for Punjabi food in this part of town, because it is definitely not heavy on the pocket, but very delightful to the palate. Keep it up guys!! :)"
5.0,"If there's a place I'd call my second home during my brief stint in Bangalore it will be zero mile Punjab. Resonating a typical punjabi kitchen, zero mile serves fresh, nutritious and Ghar jaisa Khana. The best part about this place is that the menu changes everyday. Whenever I felt homesick this place would definitely cheer me up. If you are looking for a fancy schmancy place with a 5 star service then you'd be disappointed. This place creates a homelike atmosphere. The best part- they make piping hot phulkas right in front of you. The owners are very warm and full of love  Must try  All of their paranthas Sweet lassi  Boondi raita  Phulka and almost everything else on their menu"
4.0,"Authentic Punjabi food! The Dal Makhani, Butter roti and Chicken tikka masala were really yum with just the right amount of spice to keep your taste buds tickling. The place is light on the pocket too. All in all, a fabulous first time experience."
4.0,This Punjabi cuisine rooftop restaurant is simply amazing. Do not judge the place by the way it looks in the photos. Trust me you will forget the ambience and just jump onto the plates. Well done guys. You might become my fav punjab da dhaba.
4.5,"They serves amazing north Indian food.They starters are just awesome,both veg and non veg.Love their peshwari chicken tikka,chicken tandoori,pepper mushroom.Their fulkas are just like home made fulka.Here lassi is creamy and heavenly in taste."
4.5,"Loved the food and ambience of this place. If you are missing punjab ka desi tadka, this is the perfect place for you. Must try rooh afza lassi served in cute lil  jars. Amritsari kofta abd nan cooked to perfection and tasted yumm! PS:There is no lift so be ready to climb up 4 floors."
4.5,"Amazing food! The only reason I am deducting half a point on my rating is because of the slow service. Otherwise, everything was absolutely spot on! We went for a team lunch today - 7 of us. We reached the restaurant at 12:30pm or so. The restaurant is easy to locate, and there is ample parking in the streets around. Ambiance is truly casual - just a notch above the typical office canteen. I am not judging it by the ambiance, but please be aware that this is not the place to take your date to impress (unless your date is a serious foodie!) We ordered the veg platter as starters. Everything in the platter was nice. Not exceptionally nice, but just nice. Then came the main course. This completely blew our minds away. As in, the quality of the food was a conversation stopper. Dall Makhani had oodles of real makkhan, the paneer was just perfectly succulent, the rotis and parthas were so nice and soft and ... completely authentic home-made (nay, mummy-made) style. Needless to say, we over ate :) All in all, highly recommended."
3.5,First impression not dat great... But food is good n tasty ..nice breeze place Lacks in comforts ....the only place needs to be improved is comfort n ambience
4.5,"I always felt that HSR had a dearth of good restaurant however ZMP puts HSR on my food map.   Look no further for authentic Punjabi dishes.This place lives up to its name and dishes out some great food;Veg and Non-Veg alike.  The servings are huge and for the cost at which they are offered , I would say that its a steal. Me and a couple of my friends tried Chicken Tandoori , Mushroom Tandoori , Murg Tikka Masala and Punjabi Paneer. We were mighty impressed with all the dishes. The chicken was soft and succulent, especially that of Tandoori chicken which I feel many places serve it dried from inside and burnt from outside. The curries though heavy tasted great. The only thing with which I was not impressed much was their Lassi. I am not saying that it was not good but comparing to their food , it just tasted average.Also, the waiters though they were courteous were not able to respond properly to questions on food.Maybe this part will improve with time given that they have newly set shop in HSR. Update after more than 10 visits:- Have tried almost all their chicken starters and gravies and I am mighty pleased with the effort they put on almost all their dishes.Tandoori Murgh & Murgh Chatkora are my all time favourites, however I also found their Murgh Kastoori Tikka to be flavourful and succulent.Murgh Rara is my favourite gravy but I also quite like their Murgh Nawabi and Murgh Methi Malai.Bhuna murgh and Murgh Makhni are good too.I think their drinks section has some scope of improvement and also wish they introduce soups and hot drinks in their menu soon;especially with the onset of cool breezy monsoon in the city."
4.5,Amazing authentic Punjabi food that is good value for money. We were a bit apprehensive when we entered the restaurant but the dishes blowed the apprehension away and we enjoyed our dinner. We will be back at ZMP again.
4.5,Authentic punjabi taste and authentic punjabi service. Came here a group of 13 for my sons birthday. The stArters distracted me from all conversation. The Sultani aloo just melts in your mouth and the chatkora chicken has just the right blend of hot and sweet. Food comes across as made with passion and sincerity. As they mentioned they don't use artificial colours or flavours. The lassi was very good but Shinkanjee and pudina pani I felt could be tangier. The methi and amritsari kulchas were also very yummy beyond our expectation. Service was quite personal and prompt. More plants could be added to improve the outdoor ambience. Pricing is reasonable. Will surely visit again!
4.0,"A Pleasant Experience. Food at this place is really good and authentic punjabi. Owner of the place is very humble and nice natured man. We had a good interaction with him. Its a roof top place, situated in HSR. Though, the infrastructure is not apt for the restaurant but it gives you an antique feeling. Moreover, when the food is good other things don't matter much to me. And This place offers pretty nice food. We had Punjabi Paneer, Dal makhani with Tawa Roti and Butter Milk. All the items were fantastic. Specially the Punjabi Paneer, it was really really good. In the end we had Buttermilk, which was aptly thick, salty and had nice blend of onions in it.  Overall, its a pretty reasonable and good place to go."
4.5,"The food is extremely delicious and the vegetarians too will love the taste. Bhindi lovers should try the bhindi fry, i have never had a tastier version in any other restaurant. The quantity is good and cant complain about the service either. Rooftop ambience is decent. Accepts card payments now."
4.5,My son was craving for North Indian food and this restaurant popped up on Zomato and I decided to order . Plain nan was huge !!! Sufficient for 2  butter chicken was tasty as it should taste not extraordinary but GOOD ! The tandoori chicken was extremely soft and succulent and pretty good . But what took the cake was SERVICE ! After 30 minutes of my order the owner called back saying there were no delivery boys and hence his father was delivering and the food arrived pronto ! This is fantastic customer service going above and beyond  . I will be a regular !
4.0,Went there on a friday afternoon.place is usually  crowded.Paneer starters are good .Main course is also decent .My advice to them would be to improve on Lassi being a punjabi restaurant it was not up to the mark
4.0,This is a relatively new joint that has opened in HSR.. The open terrace ambience is very good.. The food is excellent.. Service is really good.. The only drawback is that They haven't started accepting cards yet.. But apart from that this is a must go place for punjabi food.. The serving size is good.. And the prices are economical.. Cost for 2 will be 500-550.
4.5,"Food is great, pure Punjabi style at a reasonable price. Seems like the Punjab is actually zero miles. Ambience work is going on when I visited last time, but it seems that it will be great."
4.5,"Awesome food with reasonable pricing and good service . There's some scope for improvement in ambience and interiors, which I'm sure they're looking into. Would definitely like to come back soon. :)"
4.5,Food is very good and very reasonably priced.. The quantity is also good.. They just need to improve there infrastructure which they surely will as the restaurant picks up..
4.0,"Being a north Indian , I do miss the food from the region sometimes . And it was yesterday , I was again craving for the Dhaba style for dinner.  While browsing the Zomato listings for HSR , I saw ""Zero Mile Punjab"". Using the Map, we reached this place with ease. We parked our car on the road side.  First impression looked favorable when I saw Sardarji at the Counter. There was sense of optimism in us now.  Situated on the 5th floor rooftop,the ambiance was is minimal with array of tables with ethnic style hanging lamps illuminating the whole environment.  We could smell the appetizing food aromas while we chose to sit near the Kitchen area.  Starters : Tandoori Chicken -well done without artificial colors Drinks: Pudine Ka Paani & Chaas - Both good choice while having meal here Mains : We opted for Chicken Tikka Masala & Rada Murgh. Loved it Breads: Tandoori Roti was good but Laccha Parantha wasn't up to the mark.  My observations: This place looks very promising but has scope for improvement. As a beginners ,they also have some teething issues which will be sorted out in days to come. If you are looking for good north Indian/ punjabi dhaba style food , do visit this place. I loved it yesterday.  It is certainly value for money and I will be going there again soon.                                             thefoodietales.com"
3.0,"HI,  Food is good . No problem in that. Price also reasonable. But I have a question from Father/Son duo why you people do not give proper bill and accept cards . Same crap story I listen in EC for 6 months. Pls give proper bill and I can give u one more star in rating :) ."
4.0,"Was just going through zomato and found this place,decided to give it a try.The ambience is average ,food quantity is great, except rice.The food taste is good,staff are courteous,we ordered mushroom punjabi,dal tadka,masala papad,fulka,everything was descent,it has opened recently so don't support card,No soup /shourba in menu"
4.5,"Looking for a dhaba experience in n arnd hsr den head here.. just had dinner in this newly opened place and we loved it! They have moved from ecity to hsr recently..  Food - Had ajwani paratha, zmp spl chicken, tandoori salad, lassi N butter milk. Ajwani paratha was delicious with its softness, zmp spl chicken gravy was out f the place.. so yummy!! The salad was amazing, the veggies will love it.. it's the normal salad with tandoori/BBQ gravy touch..lassi was a bit disappointing, expected a thicker one (or rather I dint like the rhoofza topping ).  Ambience - Bright, breezy n spacious sums it up.. no fancy decor just the basic and fits in well.. the hand wash area needs some work to be done, it's in a corner and not light well. Located in 5th floor of in a less travelled service road of hsr, a bit of pain to reach there considering the one way restrictions, it's located above a diagnostic center.  Service - A bit slow but I don't really complain after the yummy food.  Since it's opened recently they do not card as yet.. Definitely recommend it for some authentic Punjabi food,would visit again to try out the other dishes!"
4.5,"Authentic Punjabi Food in HSR managed by a Punjabi Dude.....They have recently shifted from Electronic City to HSR and already created a buzz in the area. The North Indian food served here is so tasty and authentic with large serving size. Menu is full of options that you don't feel repetitive even after couple of meals here. Ambiance during evening is airy being positioned on the 5th floor with fancy lights all around. Coming to food, a must try is Tandoori Salad, Ajwain Parantha, ZMP Special Chicken, Dal Makhani. Loved the tandoori salad here. Dal Makhani is so buttery and tasty and tastes absolutely perfect with crisp yet soft paranthas.  Overall an amazing value for money addition in HSR with good food and ambiance. Food - 5/5 Amb - 3.5/5 Service - 5/5 Price - 5/5"
4.5,"Was browsing on Zomato for good new restaurants in HSR area and found this. Ordered couple of items for home delivery, just to get a first experience.  Sumit from the restaurant team talked on the phone and recommended Bhuna Murg and Kastoori Paneer Tikka (Starter).  The food was delivered within 30 mins. The packaging was amazing with everything neatly packed, even the salad, chutney and even papad !! Imagine a single rolled up papad wrapped in aluminium foil. Now thats a first !! :)  Now coming to the food. First thing which impressed me was the serving size. For a similar (or higher) price in other Punjabi restaurants, I have seen considerably lesser serving sizes.  The Kastoori paneer tikka was a stuffed one and an absolute delight! The Bhuna Murg was very tasty as well, particularly the thick gravy was amazing. It was a little bit high on the extra oily side, but then the dish was an indulgence nevertheless.  1 plate of each those items should be good enough for 2 people to share.  Looking forward now to visit their roof-top restaurant in HSR for even better experience!!"
3.5,"Went there for lunch. Lovely, soft naans and yum dal makhni. Pretty good portion and service. Being on the terrace, it gets a little hot during afternoons, which might be a negative.  Also, during my visit the place was eerily quiet, forcing us to have hushed conversations. While some people would prefer it like that, it was a no no on my end. I am sure the owners have a long way to go."
4.0,Best North Indian food in electronics city. The curries taste delicious. The place is always filled with appetizing aroma which gives you the feel of having North Indian food. Been there many times and get always the same delightful experience.
4.0,"This place is near to my office so went for a team lunch once. It is very popular among the young crowd of electronics city. It is not so much neat but yes the food is very good. We ate paneer tikka, malai kofta and both the things were really awesome. But during fridays specially go early if you want a place it becomes really crowded.  Now it is shifted to hsr when i visted this place again. Nice place , the food was good. Lassi here is amazing. And also amritsari kofta is very nice. Must try paneer lababdar awesome taste.                                                                 foodtravelpedia.wordpress.com"
4.5,"A place me and my team long wished to visit.. and we ended up having our last lunch at electronic city here. Small place though, the sweet ""uncle ji"" manages to get u a table.. but at times one has to wait long :( (lucky we wernt made to wait :p ) The food is awesome. Finger licking. I had tasted laccha paratha at many places, but dis one stole my heart... The chicken gravies ordered were tasty too.."
4.0,We have ordered food from here. Taste - excellent   Value for money - Good  Expectation for more variety...
3.5,"We tried achari chkn tikka which was in the ""today's special"" menu. It was nice. Chicken tikka masala, other nonveg starters and paneer dishes were good. But masala colddrinks was disappointing."
2.0,Visited the place and ordered online as well.. Food is good but the owner who assists and takes orders is rude and disrespectful and should certainly learn some hospitality basics.
4.0,"Well since the time I have moved in to E city this has been the place where I have eaten the most, they serve authentic Punjabi cuisine which is very delicious. They have a wide variety to choose from and they also serve the day's special as a thali. The food is fresh everytime I have been here and the taste has remained the same over the past year or so. Specifically my favourite is their chicken afghani tikka which will just melt in your mouth.  Ambience - needs improvement, upkeep is not that great Service - very efficient and they serve on time Taste - excellent Value for money - Good  Tip : Place tends to get really crowded in the afternoons so better to have a relaxed dinner rather than a lunch where you need to wait for the table, the downside to this is that their specialities are mostly available during the lunch time  Must visit if you live or work anywhere close to electronic city."
4.0,"The food is of good quality tastes good price us is also pocket friendly. Especially the chicken chaat,aachari chicken and chicken malai tikki is tasty and reminds me of my hometown taste. Overall nice food joint and I have been there 6 to 7 times already."
4.0,"I have been here about 5-7 times as the place being close to where I live. They serve Spicy Punjabi style food as the name suggests.  Food - So Far I have tried their Aloo mutter, Panner Tikka masala, Chicken Tikka masala, Mushroom Masala, Tandoori roti, Amritsari kulcha and Butter naan (not in the menu, but yes they serve it) and I like all of them but what I liked the most is the Chicken Tikka masala with Naan.  Ambiance - The ambiance is very simple and neat. They have decorated it the Dhaba style.  Service - The service is timely and the Manager and owner both takes the order at times. I find the service really good and the manager keeps smile on his face while taking the order.  Verdict - I would definitely visit to all looking for North Indian/Punjabi food in E-city. I am sure people from North Region will love the Food. Cheers!!"
4.0,"After all the word by mouth around in the office about this place had to try out by any way sooner!! So decided to go with my colleagues to this place for lunch.   Location: Its in ecity phase1 near to dominos and printo on the first floor.  Booking: hmmm!! Look out if you are going in huge chunks. Move in to the place early and get your name on the list. The place gets crowded very soon and there will be a long queue. We had to wait for 40min or so due to a 25 member group waiting for the table.  Ambience: a typical Punjabi local restaurant with decent interiors and no much hype made to  showcase. Wooden table and chair welcomes you and its pretty much dhaba style feel.  Food: This is where we need to dig in to!! Just as the table was provided we gazed into the menu to look at the authentic Punjabi items. We ordered kasturi chicken and sufiyan paneer tikka from the starter section. The chicken was soft, succulent and melting in mouth. The marinade out of hung curd and those aromatic herbs was perfect. Full plate consisted of 9 chunks of chicken. The paneer was rightly done and not over cooked to make it hard. Moving on to main course we ordered roti, amritsari kulcha, tawa roti, butter chicken, chicken do pyaza, kasturi chicken, kadai paneer, mushroom muttar, peas rice, jeera rice. Out of the lot kasturi chicken and paneer stood out and was perfectly cooked. Quantity was OK. After the heavy meal our taste buds always carved for something sweet!! Just then we thought to take lassi and gulab jamoon. Both were OK and upto the mark.  Hospitality: Uncleji was very patient and smiling to handle the loud crowd and take up the orders from each table. Loved the way he handled the situation for the 25 ppl order.  Verdict: Overall this is a decent place with good and tasty food. Would love to visit next time and try out other items on the menu. Suggestion is to improve the quality and quantity on gravy and main course. Had a good time and tasty food.  Ambience: 2.5/5 Food: 4/5 Hospitality: 3.5/5 Pricing: 3.5/5 Overall: 4/5"
3.5,"A rarest of the rare visits to, this ""end of the world"" area, brought us to ZMP, a nondescript place located atop Domino's Pizza and opposite, the Lord's Plaza.  ZMP is a no-frills place that counts amongst its regular patrons, many from the IT crowd to the B-school crowd in the vicinity. During our visit, there were 3-4 tables occupied by such students.  With it being a day off for the Thali, we were forced to order a la carte. We thus ordered Kulchas, to be accompanied by Chicken Do Pyaza & Paneer Lahori.  The former was a quintessential Chicken gravy with onions & bell peppers and one which tasted quite nice. The Paneer dish was the day's special and with a nice, rich gravy, that rendered the dish lots of flavour & heaviness too. Kulchas were well done & served hot.  We also ordered a couple of lassis, that though unfortunately are served in plastic glasses, were quite fresh, thick & tasty. Not overtly sweet & was perfectly chilled (& not cold).  Service - Quick, efficient.  VFM - 560 for 8 Kulchas + 2 curries + 2 lassis. A pretty decent VFM for 4 persons.  Verdict - Despite a run down look, the food is unpretentious & quite tasty, as ascertained from the average Zomato rating as well as a first hand witnessing of its popularity. Not a place that's meant for fine dining or formal events."
4.5,Value for money. Amazing food..good sevice. Located near my office so its a added bonus for me. Will surely recommend this place. Best part of the food is that all vegetables taste different unlike other restraurants who use same gravey for all. Its crowded during lunch time on weekends but its worth waiting.
5.0,The food is awesome in taste... With authentic Punjabi taste... Also the rate are very good... Sardarji is very affectionate and listen to your request as if he is serving his own kids.
4.0,Have been twice and did love the food. Pure Punjabi ! The ambience may be would have better - but that's not a stopper since food is awesome ! Go with team for lunch enjoy -:)
4.0,"They serve v good parathas in e city. I go there for lunch several times to have their parathas. Aloo, aloo onion or b it gobi paratha..they prepare it too well..n taste is jus too good. I like their spicy green chutney and lassi too."
4.5,"The food was great. We ordered paneer tikka , lahori paneer and lahori chicken.  The restaurant strictly maintains First Come First Serve, so you don't have to fight for seats, just get your name noted down and they will call you.  The preparation time is slightly more, but that's fine because they are serving good food"
4.0,"Zero Mile Punjab has become the prime spot for me and my friends for authentic and delicious North Indian Cuisine. I have visited the restaurant and ordered for home delivery on numerous occasions and have never once been disappointed. Food: # Mouth watering presentation # Awesome taste # Quantity is good # Worth every penny Service: # Service is good with the only exception being the waiting time (For home delivery as well). But then the Food is worth the Wait. Ambiance: # With the foodies turning up on peak hours, the place seems a bit crowded at times but apart from that there are no complaints. My Suggestions: Sufiyana Paneer Tikka, Chicken Peshawari, Mushroom Masala, Chicken Dahiwala, Bhuna Chicken, Amritsari Kulchaa and Boondi Raita."
4.5,"Great Dhaba style feel to the place. Run by a Father / Son team The greatest Amrtisari Parathas and Dal Makhni i have had till date. Would have rated it more , but i once found a bit of plastic in my paratha, real real downer  Edit - After one Bad experience followed by multiple good ones. I think it's time I make an edit to this review. The place has extended and grown so much from the last time I reviewed this place , it's amazing. We have had the best Indian food in Bangalore here ( Hands Down ) , great service. The murgh tikka gravy , amritsari kulcha and a glass of lassi is to die for. Their Kali Daal is also amazing. This place is a must !"
5.0,Amazing food!! My all time favourite Kasturi Paneer. Being a non veg also I cant miss this paneer. All veg n non veg starters are better than any 5 star restaurant.
3.0,"I had been to ZMP three times with my office colleagues. It is a simple, decent place run by a Sardarji. A perfect host, he really makes you feel at home.The food served is really good. I have tried the thalis, Kulchas,Aloo paratha,Chicken tikka masala and aloo gobi. Everything tasted nice,a homely touch added to it.Service is good. This place is worth a try."
4.0,"We came to this place for a team lunch. It's quite a decent food joint. The place is a bit dingy and shabby but the food they serve is excellent. One word of caution. The place is extremely popular among the Electronics city young crowd. So if you want to grab a peaceful lunch, please do come a bit early. The place is a bit dingy and overcrowded. But the food they serve is awesome. I loved their starters mainly. We ordered one Reshmi Kabab and one paneer Sufiana Tikka. The Paneer was amazing. For main course the option is a little limited. But All the items were well prepared and quite nice in taste. Their paratha is the best bread item in the menu. I ordered for general Alu paratha and then compelled to order the paneer paratha and the Gobi paratha."
3.0,"Decent place for starters and all, didn't like the main course much though. The ambiance is OK-ish. Menu and the prices are fair enough.  Chicken tikka and all the kulchas are really good though."
2.5,Great Punjabi food in electronic city. Authentic Punjabi food with friendly waiters. Owner a bit rude to its employees. Roti and sabji is must try and very inexpensive . But the really problem lies in hygiene and cleanliness which is missing at this place.   Food - 4/5 Ambience - 1/5 Cleanliness - 1/5 Cost - 4/5
4.0,"I have been to this place a number of times and I can say for sure that this is a decent place to fill your tummy and still save your wallet! The food is yum especially the vegetarian dishes. I have tried the Thalis, the Amritsari Kulcha (worth dying for here!), the Paneer Paratha, the Paneer Tikka and the Chicken Tikka. I would definitely recommend the Paneer Tikka! The ambience is okay. You might want to get there early to get seats on some days though. The service is a little slow at times but that depends on how crowded it is on that day."
4.0,"I visited this restaurant last friday. Indeed a Masterplace.  completely enjoyed the food, taste, variety  Everything was just too awsome, Ambience, location, place people, Menu & the Price. Total Thumbs UP.  Coolest place in Electronic city.   Just Take some time out and visit this place, You wont be dissapointed.  one last thing go here when you have time because food which gets time to get cooked tastes best. if you get what i mean.."
3.5,"This is your destination if you are looking for a no nonsense Punjabi / North Indian restaurant. Food was always tasty, you can order anything on the menu and not get disappointed. Not the place where you expect some ambience. Due to the reputation of the food, I've always found this restaurant busy, but have managed to get seated in 15-20 minutes."
3.0,A good North Indian restaurant with decent prices. The tandoori chicken was very good.  Had some issues with the food earlier and some stomach upsets but is okay now.
3.5,"Tried this new place from zomato last night and I think I found an alternative to New Punjabi Food Corner, for some time.  The food was decent but the packaging could have been a little better.   The tandoori chicken was a lotto more salty.   Overall food was pretty average delivery fare. But it was definitely good enough to add to my regular list of delivery choices.  Very reasonable pricing."
5.0,So checked in at Zero Mile punjab for a team lunch...we were around 10 people and ordered for a host of items..list is unending starting with boondi raita...mushroom...paneer tikka. .. butter kulcha..paneer butter masala...
4.0,"Its a saviour place i go almost every sat .. service is not good but food is tasty and perfectly priced .. i have tasted almost everything there but aloo onion paratha , paneer paratha naf butter is great combination to have. If u are panner lover panner butter masala and stuffed kulcha should be your order ."
4.0,I love their chicken dishes and I would definitely try much more here. Even the prices are low and its really nice with the real Punjabi flavors.
5.0,"Had been to this place like N number of times and every time I come out fully satisfied!!! The food here is finger- licking, amazingly prepared ( U can feel the Punjabi love in the tatse ) all the time!!! The best authentic Punjabi food easily accesible in electronic city. Quality , Quantity, Presentation, all justified along with the time they take to serve it Kudos to the Paneer they use ... It melts in the mouth so yummily. I have tasted almost everything on the menu (Veg and Non-Veg) and have liked it to the last bite!  Ambience : You will forget to look around after the big plate comes on your table and the starters are served! :-)"
4.0,"A hardly noticed establishment, but definitely worth a try. Not so much on the ambiance, but high on deliverables! I have been there twice and I was not disappointed. Service is good along with the menu and pricing. Be sure to try the chicken kastoori tikka-- it is mind blowing! The chicken do pyaza was very spicy and yum although the quantity could be better. Going on the veg side of things, aloo dahiwala is at the tip of my tongue. the potatoes get as tasty as they can. Other items include the Amritsari kulcha and the sweet lassi both of which are \m/. There was only one item I found average: Dhania chicken."
4.0,This place is nearby my office so is a lunch destination almost every 2 weeks or something... The place is almost always full with people waiting in ques...so it was a welcome sign that the place might be good...we generally eat a lot.. Like a lot...so we ordered a ton of food...the food is quite good...authentic north Indian..I love their tandoori chicken and chicken malai tikka.. Even their vegetarian food is good... Coming to service..is a bit slow...but not too slow....expense wise the place is moderately pricey...if u r looking for a good bite to eat a good place to check out . .
2.5,"Coming to the point directly  Ambience: Ok ok  We have ordered  kabab, lassi, mushroom  masala, tandoori roti   Kabab: 8/10  Mushroom  curry : 5/10 we have asked him to make it spicy.. Still it's sweet..   Lassi n roti are good.. I don't know about others items .."
3.5,"Nice Punjabi food. Entrance is a bit sad but nice food !!! Do check for  Onion Parata & Lachcha parata !!! Egg burji was fine , Chicken Ajwani Tikka (must try) & Bhuna chicken was different but Good !!!  My heart broke as i wanted Chaas (Buttermilk) and they didn't have it :("
3.5,"Got my lunch delivered to office from here. we got it delivered in 40 mins at peak time.I ordered Aloo peshawari,kadhai paneer,phulka and butter kulcha.Aloo peshawari was well cooked.Kadhai paneer was extra oily but nice gravy and very soft paneer. Phulka was like homemade and kulcha was ok."
4.0,A month in bangalore... The first and I did not get a chance to eat a decent Phulka... Then I visit this place and we eat a stack each... what's nice about this place is the Dal Roti (poor man's meal they say) though butter chicken is also on the nicer side and the accompaniments lassi gulab jamun and rasagulla reach the last blocks of your stomach... The not so nice thing is the entry to the place... Its shady and stinky but the food feels good on the pocket as well as excites the taste buds nicely!
4.0,Just awesome Punjabi food... Talking about ambience it can be said as per space it was OK type..talking about service it was also good worth going for a middle class but ambience and service will not satisfy if you are thinking like a high class restaurant but as per the prices it was good...
4.0,"Had gone there at a cool evening in Bangalore, for a friend's treat;the dining area seemed good for a young crowd...with their kitchen overlooking the dining area of the place. The menu had few common items that you can find in almost all small scale restaurants...but their manager was a great help, who was very hospitable.We tried out the Chicken Kastoori Tikka(which was yum...and a must try),Aloo Dahiwala(another must try) ,Dhaniya Murgh,some kulchas and sweet lassi....all dishes being to our heart's content and tummy filling. It was really a nice experience and would love to visit the place again."
4.0,"Liked the taste a lot, the ambience is a small disadvantage to it. Tried paneer lababdar and phulkas. The curry was really yummy but phulkas were very small, the size of a papad. The lassi was also really good, though less in quantity. The curry quantity and taste was just awesome."
4.0,Full marks on the Punjabi food. We touched Punjab almost literally with food - Zero Mile Punjab. Kadhi Pakora was on the board for special menu. Wasnt disappointed at all. Parathas were at its best. Absolute value for money. Wish the ambience can be worked out a little to make it more hygienic.  *Recommended* big time!
4.5,"This place is brilliant. The food is delicious, the portions are generous and the service is good. Food heaven for students and people living alone. Highly recommended: Their parathas, the Lahsooni Chicken and almost everything else. People with tiny appetites, consider the half portions - they're ridiculously filling. End your meal with a creamy lassi - you'll be delighted when the bill arrives. Complete paisa vasool!"
4.0,"Had been here with friends for lunch. Decent place with no ambience. But kudos for the tasty food. The food is really very tasty and authentic Punjabi food. Great value for money. Cost for 4 people was approximately 650rs. There are less number of tables, hence have to wait otherwise its worth trying."
3.5,Went there with a group of friends for lunch. A decent place. Food was good. We had veg as well as non-veg. Recommended for a casual meal. Sardarji gave a warm welcome to us. Car parking can be a challenge.
4.0,"A treat of delight,  the best punjabi outlet in electronic city.I personally did not visit their outlet though,  instead we ordered food for a big party in one of my friends flat. Their menu has wide range of tandoor items and parhathas and equally delicious main course dishes. Since we were a lot of people in the party we ordered perhaps all kind of tandoor items and parhaths that was on their menu. I must each and every item tasted really well and have so manyntandoor items parhathas and main courses prepared and delivered within 45 minutes was an equally worth an appreciation.  I personally liked the tangri kebab among so many well cooked punjabi platters. They made our party a hit and their food no doubt goes really well with drinks Will keep ordering from this place"
3.5,"Nice Punjabi food place... Value for money.. Panner, dal fry and zera rice.. Wahoo... Very decently priced.... As a piece of advice Panner portions are big.."
4.5,"True to its name, this place offers authentic Punjabi food. The entrance to this place is slightly dingy but the overall experience is worth. Their Kastoori Paneer Tikka, Ajwaien Paneer Tikka, Aloo Peshawari are divinely. They marinate Paneer with hung curd coupled with freshly brewed spices which enhances the taste of soft Paneer. Their non veg chicken tandoori starters are heavenly too. In the main course, I have tried Dal Ghee Tadka, Dahi Aloo, Paneer Kadhai, Paneer mushrooms and everything tasted fresh and mouth - watering. They offer Butter Milk, Rose Lassi and Plain Lassi, it gels really well with the main dish.  Must go place if you prefer taste over ambience! And you will meet some really passionate hospitable staff who will make sure that your experience is upkept!"
4.5,Its one of the few Punjabi restaurants in Electronic City. The food here is absolutely yummy and it will surely remind you of the best Punjabi you would have eaten ever. The meals are prepared with pure desi ghee and butter. The price is also relatively cheap. It's a must visit for everyone in and around Electronic City!
3.0,"I had visited this place with a friend who had had some bittersweet experiences with this place. His experience had been torrid for home delivery so my review will not be prejudiced.  We had some paneer and chicken starters along with lassi to gulp them down. The taste was authentic and reminded me of some great food that is worthy enough to be called Punjabi. Hands down it was the best i have had in electronic city (considering the gourmet restaurants in Hotels as well). I did not taste the main course as i had already satiated my appetite through starters (this was in consideration of the fact that my friend had insisted that the main course is just average). Great value for starters and money.  Update: had main course thali today and it was just average compared to the great starters they serve.   Also as i have visited this place multiple times, i could not help but observe the questionable hygiene."
4.5,Zero Mile Punjab-  Only authentic Punjabi Restaurant in the electronic city.  Loved the food.  Service is fast. Sitting arrangement is fine.  Reasonable price.
3.0,"It's quite a good place and was the nearest dhaba near my college. The food they offer is good and the prices are cheap as well. However, I feel, they must do something to glorify their restaurant. That includes the spacing (there are people waiting to grab a table for themselves and that happens quite often), kitchen and ventilation (it's hot in there)."
3.0,After reading some good reviews I thought I will also try this place.  I ordered some veg items. Yeah food was ok for the amour you pay. #cheap But its not great..  Please use  either take way or order home delivery service. You may not enjoy sitting there.. #notClean  They should make this place more cleaner and decorate it with some good dabba design(No a guy who knw interiors ) but I feel food places. Then I will add one more star to this place.  When you eat.. Feel is imp.. It will give more taste to the food.  Suggestion: If vegie try panner and daal items.. But order you food or ask for take away.
4.5,Good Punjabi food with humble behavior of the hosts. Those spices of punjab and Delhi give the aroma and waters your taste buds. One of the places in electronic city who actually make phulka the right way.
4.0,"Last month me and my friends where here in zero mile Punjab, it seems to be a small place with moderate ambience but the only thing which blew us off was the food, only word to sum it all "" exxxxxcellent"" freshly prepared and served hot. Planning for another hogging session :)"
3.5,Went to this place for a treat ....it was very crowded ..lots of waiting do food ...the main course was very normal ...starters were great ...price was fine too ...ambience was also good .. It was a nice place for office goers ...can go there once in a while if u stay here in Electronic City ...
4.0,"If you stay in this area or ever come here and you are a lover of punjabi food then this is a place which you should not miss!  We had methi chicken butter roti , amritsari kulcha and dal fry and I have to say all of these have an authentic punjabi taste full "" tadka mar ke""   But I am not giving full marks because of the all over cleanliness. The kitchen is visible from where you sit and I must say that the kitchen is clean , after all that's what matters most! So yeah a big thumbs up and you must visit this place!                                                                 foodielandblog.blogspot.com"
4.5,Nice place for actual punjabi food lovers. Less  waiting time and proper service. Small place so not ideal for big teams but that's not a con..
4.0,"Serves authentic Punjabi food. They have a limited menu, but the dishes that they do serve are great. Special shoutouts to the Amritsari Kulcha and Chicken Tikka Masala. They also have a thali system, but I wouldn't recommend that; not because the food served isn't great, but because the contents are not quite balanced.  It's a great place for a lunch out with office mates, though it might be a tight fit for a whole team."
4.5,"This is the best place to have lunch/dinner with your friends...economical as well as delicious food. If you tired of dosa n sambar, juz eat once in zero miles.....juz loving it.."
4.5,"This is a place that should not be missed, it is really awesome. Whatever you order here, whether it be veg or non veg your  taste buds are going to enjoy every bit of it.  I visit this place quite often and I make sure that I don't forget to order aalo takatak . I suggest everyone out there to give it a try."
4.0,"The one and only one competition for punjabi dhaba is this restaurant  A must visit for everyone even from the faraway places. I tried the chicken malai tikka, the way it was cooked, it remebered me the north delhi streets and i also had ordered the chicken tikka masala, it was actually a bit sweet but no onjections on that as the taste overall was nice and the lachaa paratha were a drive on with them."
4.0,"Absolute fantasy came true for me when i visited this place for the first time ever.I ordered the very signature dishes..chicken malai tikka which was the yummiest i ever had..totally mouth watering to an extent that i cant help ordering it everytime I go there which is like four to five times already in the last couple of weeks as it is the close vicinity of my office.butter chicken was a delightful preparation too and with butter kulcha it was great.In our subsequent visits there i have ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken lababdaar which were equally good , spicy as one would like.This place is a breath of fresh air after visiting so many other eating outlets in e city where the preparation is so run-of-the-mill and below standards.i haven't tried the lassi or any other desserts there but I am certainly looking forward to do so in my upcoming visits which will be anytime soon :-).Now the area of improvement at this place can be the interiors which are just decent and a eery entrance makes it difficult for people spot the place.Rest all is BALLE BALLE and I truely hope that they are consistent and I don't get bored and disappointed ever.Rating it a little above 3.7/3.8 as i really like it."
5.0,"My first experience- home delivery, a bad experience. The owner apologized and promised to improve. And I wanted to try the place out so.... My second experience - dine in, very good. The owners are super cool and committed. But the main course was OK. The owner promised to improve again My third experience - fantastic. Improved on all aspects.  I didn't know that a restaurant would demonstrate a never give up attitude but, these guys did.. They just want to improve..  Paneer n chicken starters are the pick of the lot.. Dal desi ghee is amazing. Even a simple tandoori roti tastes excellent.  God speed guys, you are set to become top restaurant folks in Bangalore by your sheer zeal to customer experience..."
4.0,"Good food for people who are looking to grab a quick lunch or dinner in electronic city.The quantities are sufficient and the prices are reasonable. Have only tried the vegetarian dishes,which are very well prepared,reminds you of home food:) Do ask for the green chutney,its one of the best I've ever tried. Have also heard from non vegetarian friends that the chicken kebab(I think that's what it was) is the best in all of Bangalore. Definitely worth a try if looking for quick food in the area."
5.0,"By far the best chicken tandoori i've had in Bangalore, and I've been to Punjab Grill, Punjabi by Nature and Tandoor to name a few. Light on pocket but big on flavors. Cant say much about veg food, but the dal makhni we had was good, so was Amritsari Kulchas. Its true that they are a bit understaffed and there's a stench while entering the stairs, but ignore these and check out the food, esp the tandoori chicken. Would definitely go back for their other tandoor options."
3.5,"If youre at Electronic city and wondering which place to lunch next!!! You should try this place. Although the place is not easily noticeably, the food definitely is!!!. Located on the 1st floor next to Ammis biriyani, this is a small, clean joint with an open kitchen in terms of the ambience.    The food is homely and reasonable priced. I have tried the Thalis more with mixed combo of parathas.The chicken curry and the lassi are must try ones.  Veggies will relish the menu too.  As I mentioned the place is small, very difficult to get a table on Fridays and its better you dont end up in big numbers on the other days."
4.0,"Bumped into this restaurant when we moved to ECity few months back. Though folks from my office are regular here, I had never been here earlier. However after my 1st visit, i've been regular here with my family. Love the khada chicken and another 2 which i dont remember the names now! Parathas are a delight and the quantity is very good considering the price charged! Decent ambience with no frills thrown and as foodies me and my wife always are on the lookout for great tasting north indian food and this place satisfied our cravings!!! Also Lassi is a sure winner.  Service could be bettered as during rush timings, the wait time increases."
4.0,"The best recommendations would be their egg rice and non- veg thalis. With the price that they've set, the quantity is more than sufficient. Their aloo paratas are simply lip- smacking as well! Only problem is the seating arrangement. Since they have a lot of people coming in, the space is insufficient to accommodate everyone."
4.0,Feels like Ghar ka khana   Great quality though space could have been utilized much better   Waiting is an issue but still it's worth it once u get the food   Do taste the lassi
1.0,Highly expensive for the quantity and quality of food!! The price is as high as a good quality restaurant like 1947 or jalpan. These good restaurants charge for the ambience and quality but zero mile Punjab charges the same amount with nothing good to offer.  If you want to burn your money by sitting in a dhaba style place and pay for a low quality and quantity food then pls go.... !!
4.0,Homely ambience sets this restaurant from others located at Electronic City. The food is cooked as you order so its truly fresh. I would strongly recommend the Aloo Takatak which is their hot selling item ????
1.0,Zero mile Punjab is (now used to be) a home place for us.. Being a vegetarian this was the best place for us in vicinity.. Although when a friend of mine today visited the place he found that they were mixing eggs in the roti's and paratha's that they make.. I am literally taken aback listening to this and moreover extremely disappointed ... Thank you zero mile Punjab but I don't think few of us are ever returning to your place again!
4.5,"Ghar ka ""ASLI"" khana, the food here is as simple and as tasty as it is back at my home.   Menu is small but everything tastes superb. The simplicity of food makes it very easily digestible and the pricing is very pocket friendly. Thali for meals or paranthas for breakfast, anytime you can go here and won't be disappointed. Its crowded most of the times but the service is always great. Lassi is one of the best available in Bangalore. Do try the pure gur (jaggery) they offer at the billdesk. Happy eating."
4.0,"If you are looking out for good quality tasty food which is also fresh, during weekdays, then this is the rite place to hit. As the name tells its a Punjabi food. I  am writing the review after numerous visit to this place.Menu is quite small. But for chicken lovers this place has got promising food. Even veg food is also good. I have seen many bad reviews to this place but I have never experienced such a thing.   Food :  Must try : chicken tandoori - chicken is always so fresh, and the masala what they use is just perfect.  Chicken peshawari : this was also good. Aloo onion paratha : One paratha is pretty filling and parathas are good. Amritsari kulcha: To find good amritsari kulcha is slightly challenging in bangalore, but you can get good one here. Veg meal : is decent and comforting for every day lunch. Sweet lassi: Thick and decent portion.  Note : this place is small place not like a big established restaurant. But they still serve you  good quality and tasty food.  If some one is looking out for good lunch on regular basis I would surly recommend this place.   Place to visit with : friends or colleagues  Service is also good. And the pricing of the food is value for money.  Service: 7/10 Food : 7/10 VFM : 7.5/10"
4.0,"A common hangout place for many of electronic city working people, this place is located above dominos in electronic city. during the lunch the place is always full (if you are late by 10 mins as per the normal lunch break :P) The best thing about this place is LASSI..!Its chilled and very tasty (a must must have it ) the food here is great.. and the uncle is even greater.. :DAloo paratha (for that matter all parathas) are good over here and the chutney with them is yum.. The thali and the daal rice are also good.The place serves food quickly."
2.0,"Fridays always made us to go outside for the dinner. We were planning to go for a Dominos and in between distracted towards Zero Mile Punjab which is Beside Dominos in Electronics City Phase 1. This restaurant is located in First Floor. While going to upstairs it was stinking badly and decided to go back. But somehow decent ambiance made us stay. We were 8 people and as usual started with Veg and Non Veg Starters. Veg starters we ordered Paneer Pakoda, Aloo Taka Tak and Mashroom Pepper Dry. Paneer was soft in Paneer Pakoda but i feel lack of quality (More Oily) and It was more like a Pakoda which we get in Street Side. Aloo Taka Tak was undeniably a disaster and lack of taste with excess chili powder and less salty. Mushroom Pepper dry gave a positive result and Mushrooms were fresh and tastes prodigious. Main Course we ordered Dal Tadka, Dal Makhani and Paneer Do Pyaza along with Rotis. He served the gravy and Dal dishes before serving Rotis. He got the Rotis after 10 mins and that's again disappointed. Dal Tadka was lacking of taste and wasn't thick (I did not find Tadka glazed or bettered on it). Dal Makhani was just ok. Paneer Do Pyaza had undue tomato puree. At last ordered Masala Rice, trust me it was a catastrophe and straight away told him to clear the dish from table. Only thing we liked was Lassi. Honestly we were totally disappointed with the food. Coming to the Service, they have only one staff to manage the complete restaurant and thats a reason service was very late. Ambiance is quite decent with lot of electrical lamps mounted on all the walls. I feel the food is overpriced for the quality and taste. Note: This review is based on Vegetarian prospective, hence did not mentioned anything about Non Veg Dishes. I will definitely not recommend this place. Overall: Taste: 2/5 Quality: 2/5 Ambiance: 3/5 VFM: 2/5 Service: 2.5/5                                             bangaloreepicure.com"
2.0,Went for lunch with my colleague on a week day... At the pick lunch hour .. It was  deserted ... Wanted to have home cooked food as per earlier reviews and ordered for Plain rice egg curry ... The egg curry was like they have added atta or maida in the gravy to make it thick... It was tasteless and difficult to digest...
4.5,"Best aloo paranthas I had in bangalore. Not many options, but whatever they are ., they will exceed your expectations. I would say... go for it."
5.0,"Home cooked food, delicious and aromatic...decent ambience...reasonable price...the host and manager Mr. Sumit is quite friendly...need I say more?"
3.5,Delivers what's offered. Nothing more nothing less. Thaalis are really good. A no bullshit restaurant with good food and mediocre ambience. And the name is an add-on.
2.5,The name is quite catchy but unfortunately that's where it ends.  The setup is between okay and decent. Menu is very simple with not too many choices.  The quality of food was nowhere near my expectations. You expect a little more when there's Punjab in the name. The dal and subji were tasteless more or less. Phulkas were also not upto the mark. Though the place is pocket friendly but after having that kind of experience I wouldn't suggest this place to others.
3.5,The food was decent. Its straight forward with no complications. Lassi wasn't thick as we wanted. The restaurant doesn't stand up to its name and reminds us that its not Zero but 100 miles away from Punjab. But the food is ok by the standards of E.city.
4.5,Awesome...reasonable...less oil tasty....especially the lassis and lachha paratha are too good....
5.0,"We visit Zero Mile Punjab almost daily (as food is affordable) and never get bored with the parathas or paneer or any other vegie....Food is really spicy and tasty which make us feel that we are actually ""0 miles from punjab""...;-) :-)"
4.5,"Delicious punjabi food!  For everyone who lives away from home and craves 'ghar ka khaana', this place is for you."
4.0,"Great tasting food.  Parathas are good, chicken items are nice.  Service is a issue if crowd is high... common in afternoons."
3.0,"FOOD: The taste is good with home made like paranthas which has nice flavour but only thing is the stuffing in parantha and the quantity of dal served is not value for money. LOCATION: Easy to find AMBIENCE: Its a clean dhaba kind of a place, the seating is also fine not for large groups or something. Overall not a place where you can enjoy ambience just like a dhaba and a little odd unclean glasses for drink water. SUGGESTION: These guys have good taste but they should give enough quantity for the price they have so that it seems value for money atleast."
3.5,"My visit to zero mile punjabi resembled to that of home cooked food.Though the place doesnt look so great,the food served was good.We ordered non veg thali,Handi chicken,egg burji,kulcha and rottis.The dishes had sufficient quanitity and was worth the price.The only problem was that it was spicy.Overall a good experience."
4.0,After coming to Bangalore. first time Punjab da swaad aa gaya. aloo Laccha (y)
4.0,Went there with minimal expectations. But the food was very good. The rotis and Phulkas were authentic and Rara Chicken was really nice. This place has spartan decor but the service is very good.
4.5,Tired of searching for places to have homely food? This is the your pit stop at zero mile. Menu keeps changing and definitely worth the money.
4.5,delicious food.. specially phulka and Lassi.. Must try !!!
4.5,Awesome food with homely taste
4.5,"Food is finger-licking good., Place is neat. Neither too lavish but neatly maintained. Quite a reasonable place for a hangout with a homely atmosphere.  Authentic punjabi food with very homely service .  best tryouts : Chicken Do Pyazaa and the lassi ( pure punjabi delight )"
