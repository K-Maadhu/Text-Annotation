1.0,"We visited because we saw good reviews, but terrible service. The waiter who served us paneer tikka almost threw it in the plate that paneer jumped a couple of centimetres from plate. Waiter gave lot attitude for no reason. Served jeera rice absolutely cold. There is no provision for parking for the restaurant at all and you have to go behind the restaurant and park on the road.food taste was ok. Overall disappointing."
1.0,Staff people doesn't respect people coming over there. We went there and checked for table booking but no one was there at desk and the booking person seems not interested in our booking. So we directly went inside and asked for table to one staff member came and showed us the table. We sat there and waiting to order food. One person came and asked us to release the table because we were 4 and that table was for 6-8 and we didn't book the table prior. And asked us to go out and book a table again and come after half an hour. Such a rude behavior.
4.0,"Ambience- 4/5 Location-5/5 Food- 4/5 Staff- 5/5 Service- 5/5  "" Khamma gani saa. Chlo gaanv chale"" . Pure vegetarian restaurant. If you are looking for a ""gaanv( village)"" style feel, do visit this place. Staff will greet you with a feeling of ""guest is god"". Aam panna and thandai will definitely give you a very homely taste.  They have a serve as you cook system."
1.0,Horrible experience. Waste of money. Delivery boy was in very shabby dress and unprofessional. Food was just bad. DEAD FLY was found while opening the food pkt. You should close the restaurant state way. ZOMATO should not get degraded by giving affiliation to unprofessional guys.
5.0,"Service: The staff are so courteous and polite that they remind of you Rajasthani Maharaja treatment Ambience: As Gramin as it gets. The decor, dim lit, copper cutlery. Just perfect Food: Ordered Malai Kofta, Garlic Naan, Aloo paratha and curd. Everything was perfect, even the curds remind of you home :)  Just a tip: Go on weekend around 7PM to avoid long queue waiting outside for the yum food.  Summary: Value for money and more ! Loved it!"
3.0,Food is not that much tasty as much as it costs. Good Ambience. It was clean and doesn't have many items. Doesn't have so many types of starters.
4.0,"Gramin is a beautiful place, with vibrant yet homely interior, when you enter the restaurant, you'll feel like you're in someone's house.  The food was simple, wholesome and tasty. The choices are segregated very well. We had a paneer gravy and a karela gravy, I personally found paneer gravy very tasty, the bitter gourd was deep-fried, I found it almost tasteless. Followed was handi biryani and curd rice.  The service is very friendly and helpful, I did a little error while choosing the starters though, when asked they said the dish isn't a dry mixture but then it was deep-fried green peas and corn, which wasn't what we expected. I really wanted to try bhindi, but that was also dry and not as expected. Other than that, we had a great experience.  I love the place for it's homely food, ambitious and honest food.  Hope this was helpful :)"
4.0,Ambience -3.5/5  Decent looking place.  Food and drinks- 4/5  The bajra khicdi and chatpata veg was good.  Price - 4.5/5  Very reasonably priced.

4.0,Great and calm ambience with typical north-Indian outlook and decor. Very polite staff members. The food was good. Too pricey though. A must-visit place for couple and family dining.
4.0,"Best vegitarian north Indian thali to have around kormangala us undoubtedly gramin.  The unique ambiance and the delicious food makes this place a must visit.  Must try: thali, buttermilk, jaljeera.  #rajeshwrites"
1.0,Food is amazing .but the waiters in the second floor are not good. They gawk at women while eating. The food is great every time we come. Bad experience with waiters gawking at women every time we come here
5.0,This is a complete veg restaurant. First this thing keep in mind.  It is a village Styled restaurant. They have painted farmers and their equipment on walls.  Staff were trying to help. It was a good experience
4.0,Nice veggie rajasthani place. Hara bhara kabab and chatpata veg were awesome. Very pocket friendly with quick service. Good experience overall.
5.0,"One the best places in Bangalore for authentic north indian flavours and fantastic ambience. Coming to this place never disappoints me. A gem in Koramangala, the thali which they serve is a must try !"
5.0,Amazing authentic Rajasthani cuisine with a super humble staff. I would highly recommend kurkuri bhindi and chatpata veg. Also jaljeera and anjeer shake were super awesome! Must visit for families and desi people
4.0,"Gramin is your place for delicious north indian food and no non-sense ambience and service. I have been there a bunch of times now and they haven't disappointed even once which is a good streak to keep up.  While I have tried multiple dishes there, their Bhindi kurkuri (Rajasthani Bhindi) is a highlight and must-try. The Paneer kadhai is delicious and dal tadka homely. Coupled with their well-made indian breads, they make a great lunch or dinner menu. And moreover, they even have the fulka which is extremely helpful on a day when you just want a simple yet delicious meal.  This place is pretty much always crowded so make sure you book a table and reach early so as to get your food on time. They have a brilliant way of taking your order in the waiting area itself by way of which you can get your food quickly once you're seated at your table."
5.0,The food is amaaazing! This is my go-to place for North Indian and Rajasthani food. Probably been here 5-6 times but never fails to impress. Prompt service and polite staff. M gonna be back soon. Thanks Gramin!
5.0,"I super liked this place. The food is amazing(amazing will be an understatement). I tried their paneer dishes, sev tamatar, jaljeera and Aam panaa.  Parking can be a concern here but once you find the spot its worth visiting this place.   Service- Very pleasing and prompt staff ."
4.0,"Tasteful food,try Rajasthani Bhindi,Daal double fry,Sev tamatar . Roti basket is flawless. Ambience is outdated and needs renovation,service is excellent"
5.0,"This little place enjoys being in the centre of most happening traffic light of kmg (:P) and is also a little hard to spot. For the onlookers, it is snuggled within Raheja complex. Despite having loads of space, there is absolutely no parking allowed. Adjacent Truffles road is your only resort.  Anyway, with a very traditional ambiance summing up from brass glasses, wall hangings, (very) heavy plates, this place cooks one of the best north Indian food   Having tried out there Paneer dhuandhar, sev bhaji, PBM-usual, Makhni daal,  I can firmly give it a 5/5.  Side notes, The portions are heavy. Plan beforehand. Aam panna is particularly good."
1.0,"You will enjoy a homely food at the restaurant. However, when you order the food as a parcel the taste is not the same. I visited and had food at gramin 4 times and the food was awesome. To my bad luck I ordered 3 times during different occasions the taste and quality of food was bad. I ordered Panner curry and the they were very hard, which was not the situation when I had in the restaurant. May be such things can be avoided."
3.0,We were out of options due to time crunch. So we grabbed a table in gramin. Gives u the feeling of village ambience. Dark and dusty environment. There were plenty of food varieties in veg. We opted for thali and aam panna for drinks. The food was ok infact I found it little tasteless. So if u r out of options and u r a vegetarian this ones for you.
4.0,"In the more than 10 years that Ive been visiting Gramin, one thing has always stood out - its always full!! From the wonderful thali, to the stellar crisp bhindi starter and not to forget the must try lassi. This place serves up a wonderful vegetarian fare that doesnt disappoint."
5.0,"This is one of the best experience I ever had in Bangalore. The restaurant is really great. Tasty food, nice ambiance and staff is polite. Overall it was great experience for me. I will give it 5+ star overall and will love to go to this restaurant again for sure."
4.0,"Situated in Raheja Arcade , barely 2 min walk from Forum Mall, Kormangala , this is a very popular place.  The ambience and seating arrangement is good. The service is also fair.  I went with Dinesh Kumar Agarwal and two other friends who decided to visit this place on a Holi night for dinner. We were four people. We ordered Stuffed Kulcha, Gramin Kofta, Sev Tamatar ki Sabzi.  * Kulcha : It was very properly cooked. The stuffing was also good in quantity.  * Gramin Kofta : It had 8 small pieces of kofta. The kofta were properly fried. The gravy was also good in quantity.  * Sev Tamatar ki Sabzi : This dish was not at all good. It had a good taste.  The area was neat and clean. They have two seating arrangement. One in the ground floor and the other in the first floor.  We had a good time. Thank you Gramin for having us. #HappyEating"
4.0,"Very good family restaurant for pure vegetarian and thali is damn good , nice gesture from staffs and quality of food is good , they may have to renovate the ambience a bit , as its been old and the best part is (have attached pic )"
4.0,"To start with, we had been to some other restaurant before but were really upset so we had only starters and came out. Then decided that let's try gramin.  To our surprise this was really good. We had bhindi rajsthani, roti, dal makhani, curd. As we were not that hungry we couldn't try many dishes, but to whatever we ate was really satisfying, stomach full, and happily came out.  Staff is good, you will get village kind feeling and North Indian food, melodies light hindi songs in background. I loved that concept that music choice was good and not too loud like others.  Wish to visit again."
4.0,"A very village like theme of this restaurant is quite evident from the time you enter and and the ambiance feels really nice.  I always sit on the first floor whenever i go. Coming to the food, we had - Thandai - 5/5 (Authentic taste) Gulkand Milk shake - 5/5 (Must try) Bhindi Rajasthani - 5/5 (Must try, very crispy) Harabhara kabab - 3.5/5 ( Not soft, did not feel fresh, also was deep fried) Paneer tikka masala - 4.5/5 (Really nice sabzi) Also, butter chilli roti was good.  Overall, loved the food here."
4.0,This place is right inside Raheja arcade. Very rustic ambience. They have a nice variety on the menu. Tried a few Jain and normal dishes. The staff are really friendly and great place for simple straightforward tasty food. The prices are not too heavy on the pocket too.
5.0,"Excellent food. Great value for money. Polite staff. Nice ambiance.  We tried Paneer, Chole, Makai ki roti and sarso ka saag. The food was delicious."
1.0,"Quality has really deteriorated over a period of years for this place . Though the place is expensive, but quality is not at all upto money . You can easily get a similar food in any normal Dhaba. Ambience -3"
5.0,"This place is very neat and clean. And best gramin food in the city. Parking will be a problem at times. But if you see the food quality , you can ignore the issue of car parking."
5.0,"The ambience of the place and the cutlery used matches with the name of the place. The rotis at the place including the phulkas are really delicious. Even the curries, PBM are good. Pricing is on point. Good place."
5.0,Serves good food and the location is also approachable. The quality of food is good and also the ambiance is nice. Good place to eat North Indian food. We had dal ghee tadka and was really good.
5.0,"Firstly table booking is recommended as it has peak customers in the noon. We had ordered for panner kurkure and bendi fry in starters and thali for food! In terms of taste, no doubt they are one of the best. Also tried masala buttermilk and kesar lassi they tasted pretty good as well.   Pricing: 4.5/5 Ambience: 3/5 Quantity: 5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Food: 5/5"
5.0,"A pure vegetarian restaurant, if you are a North Indian cuisine lover trust me this is the place for you. You will fall in love with the place, the ambience, the people there and the food. It just gives a homely and calm feeling. Perfect spot for family and one who needs a calm and tasty dinner time. And they havent missed to add the proper Rajasthani essence to it."
5.0,The best food I had ever had in recent past.! Thy just served what I wanted to... N it was best n tasty n delicious food I have tasted with my one of best of best friend 'baba'
5.0,"Excellent service and great food. The best thing about the place was that they asked us to tell them our order while we were waiting. Avoided unnecessary waiting time once we were in. Had Bhindi Anardana, Darbari Paneer and Dal Makhani - everything was great... Keep it up guys..."
5.0,An all veg restaurant. If you have a taste for North Indian specially Rajasthani then it's a must visit for you. Malai methi matar is their speciality and do visit with your friends. But there would be a waiting line during weekends so do take into account for that. Service is good. Never tasted better North Indian food elsewhere.
4.0,"There is wide variety of vegetarian food to choose with from menu here. The best of all is they have low calorie food and vegan food options as well, thats the eye catchy here. Bhindi Rajastani and phulke were very very tasty. A delight for veg lovers. I am sure there would be no disappointment if you plan to visit. I would highly recommend this place  Ambiance gives real desi look, I liked it very much. Staff are very pleasing, they greet us with nice smile and namaste. Approximately 600 Rs is required for 2 people to enjoy their food"
4.0,"For North Indian food, it is my go to place. It serves a range of options in curries. The food preparation to taste is exceptional.  The online ordering services are also commendable."
5.0,"Plenty of options and most of them are lip smacking! The staff is courteous and helpful and encourages trying of their specialities which never disappoint! Go in early if the plan is to dine, especially on weekend, as the queue can be quite over-whelming! But they do have a nice waiting area where you can order in advance so the food is ready by the time you are seated!"
5.0,"Gramin Koramangala 7th block.  Visited this place. Had Rajasthani thali, presentation and sitting arrangements of this restaurant was really unique and staff are very kind served with Good atticates. Food was really tempting and mesmerising very good quality food and freshly served, not very expensive, for experience place is really good.  Taste : 5/5 Price :5/5 Service : 5/5 Ambience : 5/5 Cleanliness :5/5"
5.0,A very good place to have authentic vegetarian food. This place gives a homely feeling! Good ambiance. Staff members here are really very interactive.. This restaurant has a homely sitting arrangement. Food was just amazing. Must try options : Tawa corn peas Paneer kolhapuri I vil surely visit this place again.!
4.0,"Great place to have vegetarian authentic food. Mostly full but still you will get a table within 10 min. I ordered harabara kabab, malai kofta, bhindi. Everything was awesome and serve hot. Taste wise it is perfect."
5.0,A very nice place with ambience that gives a feeling of the village life. The food here is also really nice. Bhindi Rajasthani is a must try for all those people who like some chatpata food. Also the traditional lassi is a good one too..
5.0,Gramin.. Best place for having some great north Indian dishes... Great ambiance.. Best service... Great quality and quantity... I'll give 10 on 10... Must try place in Koramangala for Veggies..
5.0,"The food here is beyond delicious. Ambience isn't great though. But the food is so amazing, that nothing else matters. This place is quite crowded. There are chances that you would have to wait when you visit here. But, the food here is definitely worth the wait."
5.0,"Village themed atmos and courtesy will bring take you to the trip to natives.   Food to die for - lip smacking bajra kichdi ,jaggery included as desert"
4.0,"A very homely place. Best thing about this place is selection of music. The next best thing being its theme which takes you away from all the Mexican, Italian food and cafes and Pubs. Its gives you so much desi feel in the same streets of Koramangala which is one of the best partying place of Bangalore. Food is good, staff is polite and seating arrangement is just awesome. A must try place. Also a place where one can go for getting some desi feels."
3.0,"A decent place if you want to try north indian food. Ordered kadai paneer and dal makhani, both tasted okay. They can work a little on the taste."
3.0,This a place for pure vegetarians only. The food taste is average. You may have to wait in a queue for eating. This is not a place where you can chill out. They may ask u to leave as soons as you have finished eating.
5.0,"Being a hard core non vegetarian, I was not sure about this place. But going to this place was really a superb decision, loved the ambience , food, service, quality and quantity of food.  We ordered 2 soups - corn & mix veg 1 - some sort of paneer tikka with a filling Dal & a gravy  All the dishes we had were superb. I'm definitely taking my vegetarian friends to this place again."
3.0,"Finally, I made it to Gramin after passing by a million times! I liked the basic premise of the place. All vegetarian, home style food. So heres an account of my first meal there.   I decided against the lunch Thali, because the menu looked interesting. So I ordered the potent looking green chili soda, which had a bit of sweet as well despite the green chilis floating around. Appetizers were skipped (owing to lack of time) and the main course order was Chili Roti, Methi Roti & Gobi Subzi. I was a bit disappointed with the chili roti, as it had chili flakes instead of actual chilis in it. But the taste was good. The methi roti tasted very good too, as did the Gobi Subzi. I feel the cauliflower pieces could have been bigger. Dessert was skipped too.   This is not my definitive rating. Ill visit Gramin again at leisure, to try more courses and dishes. The rating can definitely go higher. The service and cost are definite plus points too, as is the homely ambiance."
4.0,Very nice ambience with nicely done interiors. The cutlery matches the one you would imagine to receive on hearing the name. Courteous staff but service was a bit slow. The naan and kulcha along with the paneer butter masala and sarso ka saag was nicely made.
5.0,"Very nice place to have vegetarian north Indian food, the rotis here were especially yummy. Somethinig unique was the gulkhand milkshake which was very good. Very very happy with my visit. A must visit place in my book."
4.0,"Been here twice, and this review is based on my second visit. The first one wasn't a great experience, probably because we didn't order the good stuff.  Food: We had some Rajasthani Bhindi for starters. It was deliciously crunchy, and I was looking for more after finishing my plate! Then we ordered Mirchi ka Salan, Dum Dhuedaar Panchmela, and Daal Tadka, which all turned out to be amazing. Mirchi ka Salan is a must try if you're looking for something new. We also had Paneer Kolhapuri, but it was mediocre when compared to the rest. The Gheewala Phulka is definitely going to remind you of home. In the end, we had some Sweet Lassi to wash it all down. Oh, they also got us a couple of complimentary tomato soups in the beginning. It was alright.  Service and ambience: The people working here know what they're talking about and you can count on them to suggest you the right dish. There are two floors, and the top floor seems to be designed for dwarves. All the doorways are pretty low and you need to duck every time. The tables and seats are also really low, but surprisingly comfortable.  A decent place, overall. Some of the dishes are hard to find in any other place, so make sure you go with someone who's been here before."
5.0,Good north Indian food. Lot of variety and they treat you really well. Ample place to wait outside if it's crowded and they even allow to order food when you are waiting. Must try: Bindi fry
4.0,"One of the restaurants in this locality which serves best vegetarian food. The ambience is in sync with the name of the place.  The food was good. We tried stuffed Tandoori Aloo, Gulkhand milkshake, Thali lunch and a Pineapple Pulao. Loved all the dishes except for the Pulao.  A really good place for veg food."
3.0,Ambience was ok..good for vegetarian people.this place is especially for those people who are tired by long day shopping and want to have food... They have actually tried to copy village culture.. price was ok.taste wise ok.but if you especially want to go and have dinner/ lunch then I would say no.. in weekends its very rush there
5.0,"Nice ambience, Friendly staff, wide varity of veg cuisines as its a veg restaurant. We took 3 naan and panner butter masala, sufficient for 2. Great taste and with reasonable rate."
4.0,Good food nice ambience value for money many options to choose from can spend quality time with friends and family have a good time wanna visit again
5.0,"Pocket friendly, soul north Indian veg food. Delicious. Usually we have to wait as the crowd is always good here and why not coz they serve authentic North cuisine. I had been here many times and never was I ever dissatisfied with the food and their hospitality. Service is slow coz of lots of orders coming in bunch but the taste, the ambiance  and hospitality compensates that. Staff are polite and friendly and they'll greet you with the Indian traditional ''Namaskar'' when you enter through the main door. The ambiance is beautiful with the paintings on wall reminds of old retro dhaba style with old melodies song playing - a true Gramin experience in city. We ordered chilly babycorn in starters, butter naan and butter kulcha, paneer tikka masala and boondi raita. Loved it."
4.0,"This mezzanine restaurant is a good option for all those strict vegetarians out there. The theme of the restaurant is that of an artistic village with the wall decorations, the motifs and the festoons, and some copper cutlery(should have been brass no?!)thrown in. I drank my first thandai here and I loved its sweetness underlined by some gingery pungency. Lahsooni paneer dhuadar was dhuadar yes! For it came covered in a copper vessel with smoking charcoal embers sitting right at the centre. We ordered the very simple bhindi anardana and baingan bharta, of them both I didn't find anything worthy of a complaint. Ghee rotis were good. As far as the pricing goes, one can safely say that it is a mid-range restaurant. Service standards are good."
1.0,I liked the pineapple raita + mouth freshner in the end. The main course was insipid. I would never like to visit here and waste my time.  Not value for money.  Virain Garg do u want to say anything ?
4.0,"It's a great place for vegetarian food! Located inside Raheja Arcade in Koramangala, this place serves homely veg thalis and other times at an affordable rate. The Kulchas are good. The Service is quick and nice here! Must visit :))"
5.0,Awesome food. Budget friendly courteous staff and very fast service time. Must try dal fry ghee phulka and bhindi anaardana.  ambience is also very good very hygienic environment and washroom
3.0,The tasty is good but not really worth the price. It is too over priced. The ambience is amazing really authentic but the PRICE!! SERVICE IS NICE AND QUICK ! Must try once if you're in Bangalore near koramanglaa!
5.0,If you like vegetarian food then this the ultimate place to renew your taste buds with authentic food. Food is too yummy and you cant resist yourself to eat .
4.0,"Been here twice, situated on Kormangala 7th block. Serves Jain food (without onion and garlic - on request for certain specific dishes).  Gramin attempts of bringing in a wholesome culinary gratifying experience from the rustic north India. It is assembled with with an artistic decor, which gives it a village styled theme with a cosy ambiance.  Highlights::  1) Thandai  2) Achari Paneer  3) Gulab jamun  Tried their Masala papad, Paneer burji, butter rotis, achari paneer(spicy), handi biryani with mix raita and gulab jamun.  Great taste, light on the palate and reasonably priced.  Con::  Good luck finding a parking slot. :-P  Always gets a bit crowded, waiting time reaches around 15-20 mins .  a) Taste  4/5  b) Service  Great service, courteous staff - 5/5  c) Value for Money  4/5  d) Ambiance  4/5"
3.0,"Me with few of my friends visited this place yesterday. We tried few varieties of food. Starters were tasty, tandai was too good, pulka was ok ( have had better pulka's at gramin before), curries were ok as well. Ambience can be made much better or atleast seating needs to be changed. Service was good as always.  Taste buds : 3.5/5 Ambience : 3/5 Pocket Friendly : 3/5 Service : 4/5 Overall : 3.5/5"
5.0,A heaven for all the vegetarians out there. Reminded me of my home food. Service is really great. Pocket friendly. Nice ambience. Would love to become a frequent visitor.
4.0,Great place for a heavy meal. Chatka Gobi and baby corn chilli for starters are recommended. The staff were kind and helpful and service was decent.
3.0,"Cuisine Indian   Food 3/5 Ambience 5/5 Service 5/5  Dishes tried  Masala papad 5/5 They service an excellent masala papad overloaded with tomatoes onions and masala , worth starting with this dish   Paneer tikka 3/5  It was a good paneer tikka. Made well, the taste of the masala was good . But the masala Taste was not totally blended in the paneer. There is scope of improvement   Lasoon paneer sabzi 3/5 Was a little disappointed with this dish , it was average , not bad but not too tasty as well. You could try it  Gramin kofta 3/5 It was an average tasting kofta, slightly sweet but nothing fancy , can give it a miss   Chilly roti 4/5 I liked their chilly roti, was quite tasty , unfortunately the sabzis ordered was average, will definitely try this dish with some better sabzis if I visit again   Thandai 5/5 The thandai at the end of the meal was excellent, very tasty , not too sweet , made to perfection   Would only recommend this place to people who love Indian food"
5.0,"An amazing place to eat, very tasty food and excellent service. Waiting was really streamlined where the orders were taken when we were waiting itself"
5.0,"Quality food served at a reasonable price made me visit the place again. The great food, courteous staff and the ambience makes 'Gramin' a perfect spot for your lunch."
4.0,"Gramin! Definitely one of the best places for veg food. Not the biggest fan of having veg, but still I'd recommend this. Ambience is great! Feels quite upbeat! Plain Bollywood songs in the background. Inside rahega arcade on first floor, try the recommendations."
1.0,"I dont know how this restaurant got 4.3 rating. Visited there with friends for lunch. Food is average, ambience is nice and service is good."
1.0,Food might be good. But the whole experience spoils it because you start with no parking to the restaurant. Given there is no parking least the management can do is arrange for valet parking. I came back after several years and may be the last time
5.0,"One of the pure veg restaurant near to forum mall n must say their quality is amazing ,have been the repeated place in koramangala They serve north Indian food, the ambiance is not fancy but like name says village kind of, the best part is there is no AC at all Try the malai kofta curry over there is amazing"
5.0,Amazing food and ambience. Convinced a hard core non vegetarian friend to try this place and he loved it!! Rajasthani bhindi is a must try here.
4.0,"I visited this place long time back and liked it very much. So though of giving a try last weekend when I was near to this place. The location of Garmin is exactly opposite to famous 'The Forum Mall'.  The ambience is bewitching. They have 2 floors and the walls are decorated with beautiful paintings and sculptures. And they serve food completely in copper items and mud pots, which make the food more delicious.  This time we tried :- 1. Sarso Ka Saag - It was served in Earthen pot. And quantity was sufficient to have 4-5 Makki Ki Roti with it. 2. Makki Ki Roti - It was thin and crisp Roti , exactly how authentic Makki Ki Roti should be. And it was damn tasty too. 3. Aam Panna - What I feel, it was prepared by ready-made mixture. Because taste was exactly same. But nevertheless , the taste was good. 4. Thandai - It was really good in taste and filling.  I tried it's other items too ...Dal Makhani and Paneer Items when I visited here first time (4 years back). And till now the quality is same.  Loved everything here. Thumbs Up . Going to bookmark this place now.  For 2 persons the cost was Rs 575 including tax. It is reasonable according to food and ambience."
4.0,"The food in general is great and the service was good as well. Eventhough we made a reservation, waiting time was around 15min. Ordered bhindi rajasthani, which is fried strips of bhindi with chat masala which can be eaten like chips. Phulka and methi paneer with cashew gravy was lip smacking. The chilli soda drink was nice as well. The only disappointment was the handi biriyani. Please skip the rice items and try the roti subzi items instead."
5.0,"Have been to this place twice and it has never disappointed me. The gravies, the starters, the breads, the drinks, everything is just perfect. Malai kofta was yum and is a must try. Also, you shouldn't miss aam panna if it's the season."
5.0,Very nice place. Proper north indian food taste. It is very delicious and a must visit place to eat if you like north indian food. Presentation is great. Love it.

5.0,"Easily one of the best places in Bangalore for vegetarian food! The ambience is lovely. I have visited this place multiple times and have tasted almost everything on the menu. It's the usual go to place for my family on Sunday afternoons. The songs played just lift up your mood - when you visit, you'll know what I am talking about! Usually there's always a waiting time, but they take your orders while you're waiting so the food is ready the min you are on the table. A must visit if you love vegetarian food!"

5.0,"And a 5 star for their beautiful ambience which feels alot like being in a gramin. Well i tried Jain Biryani,Dal makhani and Paneer Malai kofta. Biryani here is awesome . Nothing like anything. Do visit them guys."
1.0,"Below standard,place is hygenic but service is poor.i was fooled by the rating for the restaurant on zomato and google.paneer was sour ,dal makhni was poor. Gulab jamun not properly cooked. Very bad experience, no taste to the food. I feel for pure veg people,and the best part is it is nominated for best veg restaurant in Bangalore!! Hilarious"
5.0,Have been visiting this place for close to 10 years now. So happy to know and let other food connoisseur know that in terms of taste it has just remained at the top and what has improved is their service and staff attitude. I always keep going back here whenever I crave for authentic North Indian food and never have I ever been disappointed. The quality and quantity of the food is really awesome and the fact that it is still so economical is such a great thing. The only drawback is the fact that getting a parking spot is a real pain. Other than that it is always a delightful experience. I will certainly recommend this place to everyone.
5.0,This place is a delight for all vegetarian folks in Bangalore. It's popular and there's always a queue to get in. Love the boondi raita and masala buttermilk here. Need to visit again soon
4.0,Went here for dinner. We had lasuni paneer for starter and handi biryani. The paneer was amazing and was served with green chutney. The handi biryani tasted good. Also i had masala buttermilk which was very refreshing and very very tasty. I highly recommend to taste the masala buttermilk. The ambience is very appealing as well. Over all it is a good place for good vegetarian food.
4.0,"Location of Gramin is pretty good, right opposite Koramangala Forum. It's a good local restaurant to try with tranditonal decor. Gramin means ""the village"". So it aims to serve local tastes without artifical flavoring. The food is a bit spicy for me. But it's a money worth.  They have vegan option and diet option, which is quite friendly!"
4.0,"Want to have great indian food with authentic taste Head out to gramin, located at the ground floor of raheja arcade.  It has great indian interior and the service is amazing too.  Must try their lassi and buttermilk. Also try their dal makahanis  Thalis also fill you up and have great quantity.  Delight for vegetarians."
5.0,"This place gives you a rural feel. The decor, seating, etc has the Indian touch. The background music is old Hindi songs. The food is awesome. I liked the way the food is served. If you are looking for a place with rural touch or something, this is a must try. Its quite reasonable. Have been here a couple of times. Would definitely recommend."
4.0,Amazing ambience and the Rajasthani bhindi is a must try. The shikanji was also good. The lachcha paratha was okay. The darbari paneer is also okay
4.0,"Food Paradise for all my vegetarian friends. You must try their dal Afghani, Mirchi paranthe, veg pulao. There is always a queue outside. So you can well understand that this is a real popular place."
1.0,"I'll tell your what happened. So I went to the restaurant today the first time and order paneer butter masala and kaju curry. Long story short I got diarrhoea and now I'm at the hospital.  Edit: So turns out it wasn't diarrhoea but food poisoning, got a big bill from the hospital .. thanks to gramin"
3.0,Used to be nice place once. Food was good. Finding a table during peak hours is quite a challenge. Long waiting time a big turn off - reason for -1* Ambience and seating is rustic and gives a gaonwala feel. Try chatpata Bindi starter and dont miss to wash down your meal with a glass of Thandai
3.0,"A good place to have Indian authentic food. Upper deck seating is not that great tho. Dates milkshakes, buttermilk and jaljeera are must try."
4.0,"Gramin has a nice ambience. And they have low oil,low spice food. Pricing is real cheap and if you want home cooked north indian food,then this place will not disappoint."
5.0,taste okay
4.0,"Food: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 5/5  We had ordered  Mughalai Palak Paneer sabji(Not too spicy and not too mild, gravy was of fine quality, thick in nature, 4/5), Butter naan(as usual taste, nothing different, 4/5), Stuffed kulcha(4/5), Phirki stuffed kulcha(Must try if you like spicey food,5/5)  Not to mention the quick service and friendly staff adding a bit of their own flavour on top of it :)"
4.0,"The restaurant is a very good place for a peaceful North Indian meal. The ambience is also very welcoming. The pricing is pretty much standard - nothing you'd find high or too cheap either. Also, the good thing is they don't really mess up in the dishes. If you want a safe option for dinner or lunch, this place looks like the ideal option around forum mall / koramangala 7th block"
5.0,Good option for Veg Food!! The Restaurant is very small and can accomodate very less people. But even the people wait for their turn and have food.  The food is very good and the seating arrangement is different when compared to other hotels.  Better to make a booking before visiting this place.
4.0,"Very tasty vegetarian food. Feels healthy as well. Been there thrice, will surely go back. Crowded over weekends. Be early, willing to wait. Space feels crunched. Seating is awkward, especially if you are tall. Maybe the uneasy seating is thoughtful, so you don't end up staying long as it's crowded."
4.0,"This review is going to be bit long since we have tasted lot of items here. Tomato Soup - As a stater we try this at lot of places, not many places cook this well. (Best served in @RS Shiv Sagar in malleswaram). This is just an okay version 3/5 Bhindi Rajasthani - Bhindi is the last thing on earth which I would eat, but boy they have invented something new. Its fried bhindi and its great. 5/5 Hara Bhara Kabab - This was not great and just had it once. Best eaten at Banjara Melting Pot. Will rate it 3/5 Jaljeera - This one had good taste but not great 4/5 Aam Ka Panna - This was aptly prepared and was great. 5/5 Buttermilk - You can hardly find any place making this bad, not my preference but yeah 5/5 Sweet Lassi - Another disappointing item for us. 2/5 Gramin Veg - This was a new dish for us and it tasted good. 4/5 Malai Kofta - This item was good but not great. 4/5 Daal Fry - Dal Fry is always Toor dal and no other dal and they failed miserably in this. 1/5 Overall Gramin is a place where we keep coming back since we know what we can eat and specially due to kurkuri bhindi. Good job guys"
3.0,"Great place but isn't much impressive compared to the other vegetarian restaurants in the vicinity.  There is no proper parking space owned by the restaurant which would make you opt for the paid parking area behind the restaurant.  Kudos to the ambience of the place, gives you a fresh, authentic Village wali feeling. Friendly staff, and attractive menu.  Coming to the food, we ordered Paneer kurkure (nothing to brag about), a bread basket and went for a Deshi Sabji side dish (as suggested by the waiter when we asked for a non spicy dish). The side dish was very spicy and the Roti's/parathas/kulchas were just ok. Handi Biryani with mix raitha was worth mentioning. It had the right taste. Lassi/milkshakes/buttermilk was good.  Very well priced and easy on the pocket.  There is a room for improvement at this restaurant as it is located at the center of koramangala and Veggies would love to be there.  Keep rocking!"
3.0,"Average ambience, food and service. In rush hours you often have to place order before you get the table, may be that was the reason the food served to us was cold. We ordered two soups corn and tomato, both were awful and tasted as if made from ready to cook knor soups. Food was decent, no excess spices or oil. Masala soda was great and will recommend that."
2.0,Not really satisfied with the taste. Went in expecting much more. Claims to serve authentic rural north Indian food but lacks the zest. Service was decent though.
4.0,Perfect pocket friendly restaurant for family . Do book a table before leaving as this is highly crowded place especially on weekdays due to many offices nearby. Parking is an issue though. Food is proper Rajasthani themed and flavoured.
4.0,Tasty food and good environment. Best place for vegetarians. It would be good if they can add some deserts in the menu.. thats the only gap.
3.0,"Why we went there: Very good vegetarian restaurant What we liked: Food quality What could be better: I've been there twice and both times I did not feel the service to be as good as the food. The staff were very reluctant to even come to the table to take order. Platter winner: Chilli baby corn starter, Gramin kofta. Word of caution: I personally felt the food to be little spicy.  Food is worth 4/5. Giving 3 for the service."
1.0,Ghee phulka had hardly any ghee.
3.0,"Bakasura didn't find it amusing! The taste was average the ambience was average. Thali with phulka, was average. Nothing great. Overall its a one timer.                                                                  bakasuraforever.in"
1.0,such disastereous food.. almost 700 bucks in drain.. burnt veg biryani and aloo Gobi.. never thought that this restaurant's food quality and taste would be YUK..
1.0,"Overhyped place. Service is pathetic. Food was just average. Would not recommend to anyone. There are a very few pure veg options in bangalore, that may be the reason of its rise."
4.0,This place is all fav for north Indian vegetarian cuisine.Ambience just The different starters being served here are really delicious apart from the usual ones like scripy bhindi it was lip smacking . Snack all time favourite is chole batura. .Dinner items are okay can be improved taste wise
4.0,"This place is houseful everyday, you heard it right everyday. Food here is amazing and service is super quick like they make up for the waiting time. Recommended is Bhindhi Rajasthani and you will go back for this."
5.0,"Loved the ambience and the food. Visited this place for team lunch. Opted for the veg thali. We were served tandoori roti, dal, paneer, aloo dum,salad,gulab jamun, raita and pulao. Loved the food and quantity was great. Had a filling lunch. Looking forward to visiting again soon."
1.0,Food was good. But I got bit by bed bugs when dining at this place. Worst experience ever. I even saw the bugs crawling under the seat. Kept scratching the entire time.
4.0,"Went there on dussehra evening. Was craving for good north Indian food which is a rarity in Bangalore.  Gramin didn't disappoint. There was waiting for bigger tables, being just 4 people we got a seat straight away.  Ambience: Nice ambience with a village hut like design, comfortable seating, music is played but not too loud. Lighting also at optimum level.  Food: Gramin is famous for authetic North Indian flavours. I was looking for same and did not get disappointed.  Ordered mix veg soup, masala papad, sev tamatar, darbari paneer, roti basket, pudina khatta meetha and thandai.  The most liked item for me was the sev tamatar gravy. It was very good, darbari paneer was good too, soup was decent.  Pudina khatta meetha drink was so so good.  Service: Quick service.  The menu there is a very extensive one and obviously in one visit you can't have it all but whatever I ordered I wasn't disappointed.  Recommended for North Indian food. And on top of everyone is not too heavy on pocket."
4.0,"Food was good, very friendly staffs and the ambiance really reminded of Indian Villages. Had a good experience. Would definitely recommend it to others."
4.0,"Visited Gramin after a long time with my colleagues.  Gramin doesnt need an introduction as it has been for years! In fact when parking was absolutely easy around Raheja Arcade at Koramangala! Now thats some reference!  The interiors are quite nice and in line with their village theme. Brick walls, bamboo bars at windows , untreated wood, lanterns , works of cane and the menu card that comes on an weaved cane tray.  We ordered Bhindi Rajastani, Stuffed Tandoori Aloo, Soyabean Chatka, Harabhara Kabab, Baby corn paneer Allahabadi , Desi Sabzi, Mughlai palak Paneer, Veg Pulao, and a basket of assorted rotis.  For beverages we had Vanilla, rose, Kesar and sweet lassis, and Soda hari mirch.  My all-time favorite is the Bhindi Rajastani. It has been consistent over the years with absolutely crispy texture and the salt, sour, spicy chatpata taste.  The Stuffed tandoori Aloo is another favorite of mine. The potatoes stuffed and cooked in a Tandoor is delicious.  Not a big fan of Soyabean chatka, though it had a good mix of seasoning. Harabhara kabab was nice but I would like it a tad spicier.  The baby corn paneer Allahabadi was good and the desi sabzi and Mughlai palak paneer really went well with the rotis.  The veg pulao was quite well done too. The rice was cooked perfectly and the vegetables and seasoning were just right.  One must really try the Soda Hari mirch unless you cannot handle the heat of chilies at all. Refreshing with some fiery after notes.  The lassis were all nice and my favorite is the kesar Lassi. Ask for less sweet if desired.  Only Jamoons were available for desserts but they were good. I wish they had Gramin special desserts!  Though the place was crowded, the staff were attentive, courteous and food arrived on time.  At about 6000 rupees for 15 of us, it was indeed value for money."
5.0,My favorite place for North Indian vegetarian food. Extremely polite and happy staff. Gets crowded over weekend. Value for money.  My recommendation: Dal Khichdi
5.0,"Very friendly people, good ambience.. Enjoyed different varieties of tasty food with Family.. Book in advance.. Thandai, Jal Jeera was awesome. We had No Onion No Garlic food."
0,"One of the very few place in Bengaluru for good vegetarian food .Nice customer service .Different variety on menu and taste is good too..Only issue is with the parking ,you need to park at forum mall and come all the way walking to this place.But all is good when the food is good.My special recommendation ,do order crispy Bhindi.  #Vegfood #Bengalurufood"
3.0,"Went to Garmin after many many recommendations from friends. While the setting was really cosy, I was disappointed with the food quality. We ordered a multitude of items ranging from karela, dal makhani, Aloo chutki, dal thadka, palak paneer, malai kofta, masala papad among others. All over the experience was fairly average. Will go back for the buttermilk and aam panna though"
5.0,Gramin is amazingly good in food. Everything whatever we ordered is turns out delicious. We had gramin kofta i think it is the best kofta in Banglore. We enjoyed our dinner & staff is also very friendly. Service is also very good.
2.0,Service is okk...but the food taste is not good especially the main course. There was no deliciousness in any of the vegetable we ordered here
4.0,"Village themed restaurant with good quality food.  My order and review for each item: Starters- Aloo Chutki: Average , slightly overcooked and had too much of Curry Leaves. Lasuni Paneer Dhuadar: Very good, especially the chutney.  Drinks Lassi Sweet- Excellent:The best lassi I have had in Banglore till now. Amazing Masala Butter Milk- Good   Main Course- Kadai Paneer- Good Kaju Masala- Good, little spicy Daal Makhni- Average  Gramin Veg- Average, was like mix veg of a normal restaurant.  Overall great experience, and good service!"
5.0,we are having food in gramin from last 5 yearsss...yess food is superb n fresh n yes quantity also enough... today i ordered gramin biryani at home through zomato first time it was superbb... keep it up...
4.0,"For absolute veg food lovers.  A delicious review is coming soon. Stay tuned.  Place - Gramin Location - near 5th block, kormangala, bengaluru Name of the dish - mughlai palak paneer, methi roti, kulcha, chataka soyabean, buttermilk, gulab Jamun  Restaurant - 4.5 ( for absolutely veg lovers) Dish featured - 4.5 Flavours - 4.5 Service - quick & friendly Overall -"
4.0,A good place for foodies if you are a vegetarian. Authentic taste. Must try bhindi and baingan ka bharta. And shikanji was  A must place to take your family. Pre table reservation is highly recommended.
5.0,Really liked the ambience . Food was great. A must go place in Koramangala . Punjabi paneer was lip smacking good and no word for buttermilk . Totally had a great lunch here
4.0,A wonderfully designed village themed restaurant that is not at all heavy on the pocket. Make sure to book a table is advance. The food here is simply awesome. North Indian food at it's best. A must go for northees who are craving for some homely food.
4.0,"Perfect for vegetarian's! Very well trained staff.  Though place appears to be congested, with small seatings and long queue waiting out to get in , This place is all about good food and the interiors.  The Hari mirchi soda was amazing though the heat burns ur guts , its worth a try.  We had the butter chilli roti, stuffed kulcha and punjabi paneer masala all were pretty decent , unlike the heavily ghee laden curry or rotis elsewhere, here the food is more of comfort and to the limit.  The best was the bhara hua tandoori aloo, with mint &curd chutney. It was damn good.  All in all worth visiting ,to satisfy ur vegeterian pallate."
5.0,"food it really good. Especially the way they serve the food is really commendable. (copper plate, copper jug..it is really adorable). The prize is little high, but it is acceptable for the positive they provide"
1.0,Poor service and poor food.Very disappointing. What Gramin in this restaurant? They won't even come to your table after first serving. Food taste is also very ordinary.
4.0,Food was good and delivery was on time. Food was good and delivery was on time. Food was good and delivery was on time. Food was good and delivery was on time.
1.0,"Food is served completely stale, cold, and poor.. staff is bad.. manager has not even taken any action to this and gave Ill excuses for serving bad food. Highly not recommended.. and upon complaining manager reply was (""why are you still sitting here leave the restraunt"").."
1.0,Not a good place if you like your food warm and fresh. Have been to this place recently and was served cold rotis and stale dal upon questioning the manager replied we will give this order for free. Very poor quality of food highly doubt the food they serve. Please be aware before you step in this restaurant again.
5.0,I hope if there were hundred stars to rate this place... Perfect countryside ambiance Fingerlicking food They literally nail north Indian cuisines !! Must visit !!
4.0,"Another one of those places with desi ambience serving food in copper utensils but this one is special. Service is quite fast and they are courteous enough to take your order even when youre waiting. The food is tasty and Gramin Paneer was deliciously prepared.  Only con : Navratan Korma was excessively sweet. Other than that, a positive experience!!"
4.0,One of the few places in Bangalore to have pure vegetarian north Indian food.. A must visit place if u are craving for delicious North Indian food & are in Koramangla vicinity. There is usually a wait time of 15-20 mts during peak hours but the wait is worth it..
5.0,"I've been to this place a million times but I've finally decided to write a review to appreciate each and every aspect. Starting off with the interior, it resembles the Rajasthani suburbs. One of the best places to have Indian vegetarian cuisine. The food is normally priced and everything has a distinct flavour. So we tried the Hara Bhara Kabab, Masala Papad(which is mandatory to warm up your appetite), Bharwan Paneer Tikka(which was quite simple yet really good), Tawa Corn Peas( something I order everytime I visit, it's really piquant), Stuffed Tandoori Aloo, Veg Pulav, Dal Tadka(this will hit home) and Dal Makhani which was really to die for. So yeah it was really good"
5.0,"In a search of a vegetarian restaurant we ended up to this place called Gramin which has a concept of Rajasthani village... it has a mezzanine architecture which is very impressive ....  In food they have wide variety of vegetarian dishes ... and believe me 1st time I enjoyed veg food... I want to give special shout out to their soup .... I have never tasted corn soup like this ever... it is really awesome.... And the famous bhindi fry also tastes different ... overall food was very good.... This place is pocket friendly also .... So no need to think of budget before going to this place... PS: Be prepared for long queue during peak hours and be patient ..... Overall, If you want to have good vegetarian food this is the right place to visit...."
5.0,"Whenever I am in or around Koramangala, I end up having my lunch or dinner at this place. Been almost 10 years now when I first visited them. The food has lived up to my expectations everytime and their pricing is still pocket-friendly. The constant rush at this place may have made the staff a bit complacent, otherwise, there is nothing to complaint about! P.S.  Most of the sabzi gravy is generally spicier than usual, but to my liking :)"
4.0,"I have been to this place a couple of times.The second time I visisted for dinner we had to wait for around 15 minutes to get a table and we were asked to order food when we were waiting. Ambience is a little like rustic Rajasthani. Food were served in copper coated vessels We ordered bhindi Rajasthani -5/5 .It was just really crispy and yummy . This was my favourite. We even ordered aloo babycorn starter.which was very good -4/5 Along with that we ordered hara Bhara kabab - 4/5 Which was decent as well.  For main course we ordered paneer and vegetable curry ,I can't exactly recall the name. But it tasted well. Along with that we ordered roti basket. For main course we ordered bhindi anardana as well as Dal . The Dal was just too good I just loved it The bhindi anardana was very yummy as well. A big thumps to this place"
4.0,"It is one of the best vegetarian restaurants to dine in which serves good north indian food. The time spent here is worth the money invested as the dishes taste homely. The hara bara kebabs, lassi, shikanji, tandoori paneer are a treat to the taste buds. The ambience is decent and the staff is courteous and right on their toes to serve timely. The place is generally crowded but they do take order in advance during the waiting period so that the foos is ready on the table once we own a seat."
4.0,"Visited this outlet for lunch. Great cozy, rustic ambience. Loved the starters. The Gobi chatpata is crunchy and delicious. Chilli soda is a new try. The thali is quite filling, except the potato sabji could have been better. Overall a 4 star experience."
4.0,"We really love going to this place when we want to have north Indian without spending much on the pocket. Last Sunday we went there for dinner with our friends so we had pudina khatta meetha, fresh lime soda, bharwan paneer Tikka, veg seekh kebab, dal makhani, veg kofta and stuffed kulcha. Paneer Tikka we didn't like much it was having some oil kind of taste , rest everything was nice specially the veg kofta is very nice."
5.0,"Went for lunch. It's located in Raheja arcade. Nice place for vegetarian food. Ordered Mix veg soup, masala papad, paneer bhurji, dal makhani and butter naans. The soup different to other places but it was very good. Masala papad had mostly tomatoes on it which was a bit of let down for me. The naan were good. Paneer bhurji and dal makhani were very good. Will definitely visit again for pure vegetarian food."
4.0,it was good
4.0,"Great food, good ambiance and very prompt service! Total desi food and desi feels can be experienced here. There is a good variety of dishes despite being a pure veg restaurant. Can be visited with freinds and family on those days when hunger pangs strike or when its time to have some spicy finger licking delicacy! :)"
5.0,"All the north Indians in the city will feel at home! As soon as you step in, you feel the zing in the place. Since they play old Bollywood songs, it takes it to a very ecstatic mood. The food is brilliant. Undoubtedly there are no complaints at all. We had Paneer Kolhapuri, jeera rice, butter roti, methi roti, raita. The pickle was too good for it had the right amount of spice, zing, tangy and sweet in it. Quick service and courteous staff + pocket friendly. Apparently lassi is the best."
4.0,"Visited this place for dinner. Good North Indian food! Only vegetarian. The staff is good, ambience is good. Quick service and very cheap too!"
4.0,Great place to have food for those who avoid onion and garlic.
4.0,"Good place, nice seating arrangement but becomes a bit difficult after ur tummy is full. Usually extremely crowded. Only veg food but tasty. Loved the thali, dal makhni, lassi is good too. A tad bit expensive for the food they serve but its good"
5.0,"Boon for pure vegetarians like us in the city of Bangalore! Cosy ambience, cheerful staff, awesome food that too at pretty reasonable, spendable rates! What more can you ask!"
1.0,"Not at all good food, very ordinary and over hyped. Regretting. We ordered Stuffed kulcha which was way too bland and disappointing , Bhindi Anardana and baby corn was undercooked , had to literally chew it hard to finish it. Canceled my rest of the order."
1.0,"Food was very Bad, I have eaten at Gramins before but this food delivered was absolutely tasteless."
2.0,This was my favourite restaurant till some time ago. We order these meals whenever we had corporate meetings and I feel there is a steady deterioration of taste and quality.
3.0,"Too much quantity, taste was good, price was on the lower side. Masala papad was really bad. But overall you can try a dinner here. its different than most of Bangalore restaurants."
4.0,"Team, while having masala food, it is must have onions and lemon. It's missing. Please keep them, if you want to charge for it, do it but keep them. It always upset and not satisfied even food is nice. Paneer tikka masala very tasty. Thumbs up. Also one suggestion, keep some options for deserts also. Feel like eating deserts after meals. Thanks"
4.0,Writing this review after visiting for the 3rd time. No doubt the place is good and the ambiance given to make it look like village is complementing the name. Food is good which is served by courteous staffs.  Good for family gathering.  Food 4/5 Staff 5/5 Ambiance 4/5
3.0,Please send the chapatis separately as the gravy from vegetables and other liquid items make them wet.
3.0,"Good food, but really spicy and pricey as well. It will be better if the amount of spice and the chilli is reduced to add more flavour to the food. Thank you"
1.0,"Ordered phulka, kulcha and paneer butter masala....paneer butter masala gravy was very sour...kulcha was just ok...overall did not like the food taste"
2.0,Dal tadka was bad! Ali Gobi Sabzi has lost all color and was black
3.0,"Been there for a sunday dinner, i didn't have to wait as I was there by 7.45. Crowd started increasing after 8, there is a good seating arrangements at waiting area. Welcoming was really good with a hand folded Namastey. Ambience is really nice and with the low sealing and late 70s music you will be taken aback to village. Soup was decent however they have only 3 options. Babycorn Paneer starter was good but it was way too spicey. Phukas n Rotis were smooth n decently tasted. Coming to side dishes it was a big disappointment for us, Paneer Kolhapuri was too sour and no cream at all and paneer wasn't soft either. Veg Kadai was full of Capsicum(bell pepper) no other vegetables were found, and it was too dry. Overall it was a okay visit."
5.0,"One among the best places to have veg food in Bangalore. Esp, you can even get Jain food here.  We loved the ambience here. Food is served in Copper utensils. It's a very crowded place, you need to wait for the table even after prior booking. The Food is a Lil spicy.  We had ordered for lasuni Paneer dhuadar among starters, butter Naan, veg kofta gravy and veg handi biryani.  All were very tasty and you get good quantity as well.  Only concern is about the parking, there's no parking nearby."
5.0,As the name goes by the restaurant will surely remind you of your village.A must visit place for north Indian Veg food.Though we had to wait for 15 mins the service inside the restaurant was good.Anjeer milk shake and Potato chutki are must try !!The Handi Veg Biryani was not up to the mark .Different kinda Roti and Sabji can be a good choice for dinner.
5.0,"This is a great place for Desi Khaana and serves only veg food. The Parathas, Curries and the desserts were amazing. We tried Achaari Paneer, Dum Aloo, Chaas, Bhindi Masala, Baingan ka Bharta. Methi and Firki parathas are a must try. The gulaab jamun was hot and yummy."
4.0,"Good food , nice seating space , you will get a little Rajasthani feeling , place is little crowded and maybe you can focus a little more on being quick at the service"
4.0,Its a veg restaurant. I have visited this place twice and loved it. Food quality & quantity r good. But there are few things u need to know: 1. There is no pre booking so reach there half an hour before u r planning to go as it is always crowded. 2. U can order ur food while waiting so that u dont have to wait when u get a table. 3. U ll hear 70's songs in background. Enjoy ur food
4.0,"I believe this is one of the most visited place in Koramangla by families and groups. You can always find people waiting outside during lunch and dinner time.  For me too, this is one of my favorites. I used to visit this place quite often when I moved to Bangalore. But over the time, I felt that all the dishes (main course veggies) had a similar base taste.  I am a fan of Nimbu Shikanji here.  Service depends on crowd."
3.0,"I went in expecting good food but this turned out just okay. We ordered aloo jeera fry, methi malai paneer and dal fry but, the aloo was super spicy it felt like a nuclear missile has exploded and methi taste was missing in methi malai paneer.  The ambience is apt for its name and staff is polite."
5.0,very good food
3.0,"I recently visited to have dinner, isn't hard to spot in kormangla as I entered, restaurant was in mezzanine architecture with stairs are made of wooden.A authentic vegetarian restaurant serves in two variants with main course cuisines one in spices with onion and other spices with onion and tomatoes,prices also vary with these two variants. I tried paneer kohlapuri which was cooked well but not cooked masterfully and they serve wide range of breads too which is too much costly apart from food they give 10% discount to Defence personnel which is really appreciatable.  Yes friendly staff,prompt service,rush on weekends ,quantity and quality are good but not pocket friendly.  One liner Visit again"
5.0,It was delicious and delivered hot. The food was perfectly spiced. Tasted awesome
5.0,"A north indian restaurant that gives you proper Rajasthan feels with scrumptious food and varieties of dishes with the. And to on it, it's a pure veg restaurant on the streets of Koramangala."
4.0,Nice ethnic place for budget and tasty food. Service is very nice despite the crowd and they maintain the quality and quantity of food as well.
3.0,"I used to visit this restaurant several times 2 years back, because of good food and ambience. But after that, the taste of food has degraded. And also they have removed some good options from the menu which used be the one of the best food items. This happened after they changed the chef. Ambience: still very good Quality: could be better (now) Quantity: good But still a good place to eat with very good ambience. You always have to wait as there will be queue for tables."
5.0,"Being a North Indian, gramin gives me homely vibes. The food is amazing and I assure u... you will surely relish each bite of it.. go check out the place...why scrolling or waiting?"
4.0,"A nice place for Indian spicy food near Forum mall,kormangla.The food was all good and spicy,loved the bindi fries and the curries were all good.The ambience is kind of a village house and the seating is with low chairs(may be difficult for older aged persons,but they've also got the regular ones).The staff are friendly.Overall a good experience."
1.0,The manager straight away said I don't have time to wait and suggest you for orders I have to respect other guests can't you see the waiting..I don't think he was serving me in free and said it's ok if you want to leave.. highly disappointed and would not visit again and never suggest anyone..
5.0,Food is really good. After long time i had good taste and good food. Thanks Gramin.
4.0,Great place for vegetarian food. The ambience and the taste of the food is really good. The food tastes freshly made and homely. The roti is very soft and tasty. We also liked their fired bhindi and the handi paneer. Their lassi is also a must try.
1.0,Food was too spicy and restaurant did not send cutlery. Dal Makhni seemed like left overs after the day's servicing
5.0,Delivery was delayed by 50 mins
2.0,Not good experience. Food quality not the same as served in the restaurant. Koftas were very hard. Boondi raitha had more salt. Paneer gravy was good.
3.0,"This is the place where you don't need to book a table, either ways you will have to wait. You will need to order while waiting and they don't take orders until you give the full order. Starters won't meet your expectations but you can rely on main course. You don't easily get such a variety of veg options in Bangalore. The ambience is according to the name. Dim lights, copper cutlery and old bollywood songs add to a nice ambience. But be ready for a rude staff.. a staff who would bring the bill while you would be still eating.. a staff who would constantly come to you and pressurise you to vacate the table for others while you would still be eating.. a staff who would take away the plate of mouth fresheners even before you can have it.. Food - 3.5, Ambience - 3, Service - 1"
2.0,Visited the place for the 1st time after reading many good reviews but got really disappointed.. Didn't like the taste.. actually cud not even eat wat we ordered.. But the restaurant was considerate enough to cancel the order and i didn't hav to pay for the same. Don't want to be rude or arrogant but it was not a pleasant experience.. may be ppl love this place.. but not my kinda place.. not giving any suggestions or advice whether to visit here or not.. coz i know so many ppl like this place and i absolutely respect that... So enjoy  but my 1st & last visit !
3.0,"Ordered food from here on a Sunday evening. The order was delivered on time and the packaging was ok. We ordered Double daal tadka (ok. I have had better), Panner tikka (ok again. Too much capsicum.), Butter naan (ok. Not too chewy). May be will try some more dishes next time like chole bhature. Overall: Food - 3/5 Delivery - 4/5 Pacakging - 3/5 Vfm - 3/5"
4.0,"This cute place in located in Raheja towers in Koramangala, they make yummy entrees esp. the tandoori. They basically serve North Indian dishes and its a pure veg restaurant. We ordered garlic nan and two types of curries, I loved the handi paneer curry but the mixed veg curry was okay, I wouldnt recommend it. They try to bring out village feel through their ambience. Overall the food is value for money and I will definitely visit this place again."
3.0,Extremely over-hyped and over-priced place... There are surely more options in Bangalore which have better offerings than this place... Long queues and waiting time is surely another turn-off
5.0,kadai paneer was awesome.
4.0,"The food was good. Still warm when delivered. The paneer was well prepared. There were no tissue papers Or salad with the delivery. So, please throw in a couple of tissue papers and some salad in the delivery package. ~Thanks."
4.0,Ticks up all the 3 categories 1. Taste 2. Quality/Quantity 3. Price... One of the best North Indian restaurant in koromangala... Panner Kadai is a thing to try
3.0,We ordered handi paneer mix veg curry with fulke and chaach. Handi paneer was very average after eating half curry you will be bored so we ordered mig veg curry. Mix veg curry was actually good and little spicy. We were able to finish both with 6 fulke. Chaach was very mild and good. As I prefer it tangy I used lemon to spike it up. Overall an average experience.
5.0,"I loved the food. We didn't expect so much quantity in starters. We had ordered starters and main course together. We were full with starters only. Would not recommend ordering basket of rotis for 2 people. The quantity, taste and presentation was really good. Loved the gramin ambience as well. Definitely recommend it. Looking forward to visit again soon."
5.0,Delicious food as always. Thank you.
3.0,not that great . okay taste
1.0,Mentioned less spicy but it was fully loaded with spice
3.0,"Been to this place quite a number of times. Have always found it jam-packed. You will have to wait in line if you reach around or after 1 pm for lunch. Coming to the first look and ambience, it has a rustic look. Quite impressive. A staff greets you with a 'Namaste' at the entrance. The seating is like that of a village - low lying tables and chairs. They have old hindi classics playing which is a treat if you love Bollywood songs. They have village style cutleries, which means heavy plates, spoons and glasses made of copper.  Have had their thali twice - it is absolutely delectable. Coming to ala carte - they have quite a unique menu. Must tries are Rajasthani bhindi, corn and peas masala and hara bhara kabab. The tawa karela that they have is different as well, but it would not suit everyone's taste. One thing which deserves a total mention is their lassi and thandai.  The only disappointment is the fact that it's too crowded and there is a huge waiting line. So, even when you are seated in the restaurant, you are expected to place your order quickly so that the staff can tend to all the customers. This doesn't let you sit there, chill, gossip and have food at your own pace. The crowd issue is there with a lot of restaurants in Bangalore where people wait for hours. But, never have I seen the staff forcing the customers seated inside to finish off their food fast. Since courteousness and service is important for me, I have given a 3; otherwise it would have been 4.5.  Food - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Price - 4/5 Service - 2.5/5 Total - 3.5/5"
4.0,"One of my personal favourites, my go-to place in Kormangala for North Indian food. This is located on 80th feet road opposite Forum. Expect a good waiting time as this place is always crowded. Food is 4/5 so is the service. Try the tikkas and Masala Chas."
5.0,superb food
3.0,Great food
5.0,My favourite place in Bengaluru for a great food.... Have been visiting this place since 8 years and always have been served great delicacies....Great place for a wonderful food and good memories.... Keep up the good work
2.0,There is no way to order jain food through App.not helpful to senior citizens who want to order jain food.. there must be an option for jain food in the app

1.0,It seems they have reduced the quality as they reduced the price.
1.0,bad
1.0,no option of zero.. butter naan ordered n they send plain stale naan. not edible by even animal
5.0,Everything there is good i am a pure veg person and i liked this place a lot the decor is good traditional one. the service is clean and polite. i had veg thali and a gulkand milkshake which in particular is a must have if you be here the quality of food on the other hand is best compared to any pure veg outlets
4.0,Visited this veggie restaurant for dinner on Saturday after strong recommendation from friends. I must say that the place didn't disappoint at all. Very nice decor and awesome food at very affordable pricing.  You'll have to wait for 20-30 mins to get a table but they have a proper process in place! Service was also pretty quick!  My order Bhindi Rajasthani - crispy ladysfinger fries - very tasty and unique Bharwan paneer tikka Gramin kofta curry - good Biryani - was simply amazing Pulka - totally worth for 18Rs a piece Shikanjvi Buttermilk Sweet - gulab jamun  Had a very hearty and filling meal for just 1100 incl GST :)
4.0,"Typical Gramin type ambience, by gramin I meant Home in Rajasthani village tye. Only difference is sitting n arrangements.  Water served in brass glass, food in steel plates .  We had ordered Hara bhara khabab, Corn soup, Masala papad..in starters everything was fresh but Hara Bhara Kabab was not upto the mark.  Papad was not roasted but fried, which should be roasted in case of Masala papad.  For main course, They have quiet a good variety but we ordered Kharadi paneer..with tandoori roti. paneer was home made but not same day fresh.  Taste wise it didnt had much flavour but ok for a change.   Finished which gulab jamun , were fresh but too sweet.  Service was good. Waiters were polite n humble.  Overall good as per my previous experiences in Bangalore."
4.0,"Amazing Service, every time I visit! Food is also great.. north indian is their signature cuisine! Great place :) just don't try curd rice.. they've kind ruined it now! Otherwise this is a go-to place for all the Indian food lovers!"
4.0,"Had a good experience as per a place that serves pure vegetarian food  The concept that was new to me was that even while waiting for a table, you get to place your order so that you dont have to wait after getting a place but the waiters seemed to be in a hurry to serve the dishes back to back Gramin kofta was really good Worth one visit to try the theme"
5.0,I went Gramin kormangala. it was good experience all together. good ambience amazing variety must visit. The quality of food was also good and delicious. Feel like coming back.
5.0,"One of the best places in Bangalore to try North Indian cuisines.! Bhindi anardana, masala chaachh are a must try. Their hospitality is good.."
2.0,Ordered 7 phulka got just 5 (bill was for 7)
5.0,"Food was really very tasty and authentic , best thing was they have option of cooking food without onion and garlic. Each and every item which we ordered was nice and worth each penny."
4.0,I went there yesterday with my family. It is usually corwded on weekends preferable to book ahead. I liked Dal Afgani and Tawa Roti. Nice options.
1.0,Garmin is just a name. They don't maintain the proper food quality and taste is worse than an ordinary stall. Never gonna order from here.
5.0,Very tasty food
2.0,the food was very average .
5.0,"I ordered from Gramin through Zomato and it has delivered a very good quality meal. From the neatly packed food to the quality of ingredients, everything is worth appreciating. I will recommend their PHULKAs as the next best thing to home phulkas. I have personally never had so homely phulkas in my culinary experience of dining out so far! Kudos to the team and I hope they keep up the quality."
5.0,I loved the simplicity and generosity of the staff. Happened to be there randomly but I loved the food just like I heard. I would highly recommend this place for veggies. You should definitely go and judge the food quality yourself. You l never regret
4.0,Good
5.0,"if u wanna have north Indian complete Desi food,then u must visit here, ambiance is like village, seating arrangement is awesome,on weekends u might get waiting,food is delicious"
5.0,tasty
5.0,yes
4.0,"Good food..Never thought vegetarian resturant can have that many variety. Best part was resturant management told ""close your eyes put finger on the menu and order, if you don't like we will refund money no questions ask."" And they actually did that. Rajasthani bhindi"
4.5,"A good family restaurant. Heaven for vegetarians. Even non vegetarian can try the different cuisines available here and just for once spare an animal's life. Ordered the famous kajju(cashew) curry and paneer. Also lassi.. oye hoye, mein kya mazza aagya...!! Sadly dont know the name written on the menu but clearly the food has left and impression on my taste buds that will surely make me visit that place again. A must go for vegetarians. Possibility of 5-10minutes waiting. But that itself shows the richness of the food available there and the amount of love poured to customers through delicious food."
1.0,Wrong gravy delivered ordered veg kofta received mix veg
4.0,Mughlai palak paneer is awesome. Handi biryani is average
4.0,"After almost a year, i had a dinner in Pure Veg restaurant. Suggested by some friends for a long time, went there yesterday, and ordered Tomato Soup, Veg Seekh Kebab, Handi Paneer Masala, Masala Papad, Stuffed Kulcha and Rotis. To my surprise, the food lived up to the expectations. But the service was slow throughout the tables. On enquiring the reason, they said a little manpower shortage in kitchen. But this is a one off incident. The ambience has a Rajasthani touch and seating is very compact and cosy. My overall experience was good."
2.0,food not that good
4.0,Visited on a weekend for a change the vegan lunch after some time... no disappointment absolutely.... crowded a little during weekends... ambiance a postive here... quality service.... good quantity and value for money... must visit for good veg food...
3.0,"Located in Raheja arcade, gramin was a frequent haunt for friends and I when when we were in college. Their lunch thali is light on the pocket but the quantity and taste is quite good. Quite often the thali was finished off with sweet lassi or hot Gulab jamun. The seating could be a bit low for the taller specimen of our species and those who were averse to the masala in the dishes used to go to om pure veg right next door."
1.0,worst food ever
4.0,One of the most popular veg restaurants in Blr for a very long time. Be prepared for for long queues during peak lunch / dinner hours.  Service is quick and prompt. Food is a delightful affair - fresh and hot.  Our favourites are the Thali / Dals and seasonal vegetables. Ambience has been the same for years and it is extremely pocket friendly. Go and try this place - especially if you are a vegetarian
4.0,Great veg food. Their Veg Thalis are really tasty and great value for money.  A la' Carte options are also good. Recommendations:  - Veg Thali - Grameen Kofta - Dal Fry - Kaju Curry  Courteous and friendly staff only adds to the experience.
5.0,"I can eat at this place any time. Nothing compares to their food in Bangalore, it is just simple awesome. Food served with a retro style and retro music. A perfect combination one can hope for. If you need anything and thinking to ask to a waiter, don't worry you don't have to ask they will already be there with your request. Highly recommended."
4.0,"If you are a vegetarian then this place does serve some nice food. Their breads and curries are try worthy. Desserts are just OK,when it comes to rice items like pulao, jeera rice etc it is tasty. Starters is the one which they need to concentrate more."
5.0,Quality food.
2.0,Food was too spicy
4.0,I was in Gramin koramangala few days back in lunch time with my friends.the food is awesome specially dal tadka & nawabi paneer with laccha paratha.the smiling face you can see among the Steward.love it.
5.0,"Excellent place to dine at or order in from. Easily the best veg restaurant in Bangalore given their menu, taste, service and ambience. Kashyap ji - hats off!"
1.0,delivered an hour late
4.0,"Go if you're looking for decent Veg North Indian food.  Went for a weekend dinner. Reached early, and were able to get a table (for six). When we came out at 9 pm, there was a long queue waiting to get in. Overall, a decent place. Decent ambience. Note that they don't have any dessert other than Gulab Jamun.  Ordered the following:  Starters.  Masala Papad -- Papad being Fried (was decent).  Tawa Karela (this was unique -- dried Karela fried with Dry Fruits -- had a slight bitter aftertaste -- so average overall).  Aaloo Chutki (Charcoal flavoured Baby Potatoes and Baby Onions fried with Curry Leaves -- was cold when served, but didn't taste bad).  Lasuni Paneer Dhuandhar -- Quintessential Paneer Tikka skewered with Capsicum and Onions (was decent).  Mains.  Kadhai Paneer (was good).  Daal with Ghee Tadka (again good).  Butter Garlic Kulcha (just about okay).  Butter Naan (fine).  Missi Roti (not good).  Drinks.  Jaljeera (just fine).  Masala Soda (good).  Pudina Khatta Meetha (bad)."
2.0,"Huge Disappointment !! Tomato Soup was so horrible that I could not have more after 2 sips. Veg Seekh Kabab, Masala Papad (full of tomato on the top) was average.  For the main course, Butter Roti was thick and didn't taste like butter roti actually. The koftas in Veg Kofta were very hard and it actually felt like it was Palak Kofta. Masala Veg was Ok. We ordered Jeera Rice which was highly ordinary. It was a local low quality rice which they used, not even Basmati. I would highly not recommend this place to anyone"
4.5,"Gramin is located in the Koramangal which is around 200 mts from Forum Mall. You will be able to spot the place as soon as you enter the Raheja Arcade. Please note that the parking is a problem, better to park in Forum or near by place.  The ambience is good and well maintained place. All the utensils used are of copper ones so make them unique compared to others in the same locality. It is better to book a table before going there otherwise you might need to wait.  Tried the regular food like masala papad, soup, baby corn masala, kulcha, fresh lime soda etc. The authentic taste impressed me a lot and surely visit again whenever I get an opportunity.  Gramin surely serves really good and tasty food which keep attracting the customers. Being in the prime area, the place is very pocket friendly and you will enjoy food. I highly recommend this place for everyone though it is pure veggie place."
1.0,worst
5.0,"This was my 4-5 visit to this place , each my time I have a great experience . And there is no dout about the quality and the taste of food . Its a pure vegetarian restaurant and you will also get Jain food here . The food is amazing . We have ordered Punjabi paneer , tandoori rotis , cheese garlic kulcha and better kulcha. The ambience is elegant and the staffs are very friendly . One suggestion they should little brush up on their speed service."
4.0,Great place for vegetarians. Awesome food and service. Just that you have to wait for around 15-20 mins on weekend to get a table. The ambiance is just perfect for a family dinner and even for friends to hangout.
4.0,wonderful place well maintained and an North Indian taste at its best very tasty specially Gramin biriyani enjoyed with best people
2.0,Had a very bad experience.  All the food we ordered where blunt or too much salt. We left almost all what we ordered.  Only drink was good. Nothing else.  I don't recommend it.
5.0,"Great food, specially if you are fond of spicy Indian food (veg) this is the best place for planning your lunch or dinner outings. Kohlapuri paneer is highly recommended ... Food is decently priced and the staff is friendly.. There's usually a long queue outside the restaurant...so make sure to leave for it on time :)"
4.0,good but portion size is less
3.0,"It is located in the Raheja Arcade which is at a walk-able distance from Forum Mall. You can spot Gramin as soon as you enter Raheja Arcade.  Ambience - They have tried to follow a village theme with their interiors. The lighting is a little dull but manageable. There are 2-3 different kinds of seating. They have put a good number of chairs outside for the customers who are waiting. All the utensils used are of brass/copper materials so everything is heavy even the plate that they give you.  Service - The staff are very fast they don't stand at a single place for more than a couple of seconds. The food arrived fast just the soup came late, every other dish was on time. The staff are helpful but can be more patient.  Food - We ordered Masala Papad, Mix Veg Soup, Baby corn Masaledar, Panneer Tikka Masala, Butter Rotis, Butter Kulcha, Masala Soda, Fresh Lime Soda, Fresh Lime Water.  Masala Papad - The Papad was quite big and the Masala on top of it was tasty. One of the best Masala Papads I have had till date.  Baby corn Masaledar tasted like Baby corn Manchuri which is not a complain cause it was good, we really enjoyed eating it. The best part was the chutney which we finished before the dish.  Mix Veg Soup was completely unexpected, it was not like regular soup with corn flour. It seemed like they had added coconut milk to it. It is difficult to judge this dish cause 2 of us liked it and 2 did not. If you are willing to take risk then you can try this.  Panneer Tikka Masala - Was a little disappointed with this. It was like a regular panneer masala except that the panneer was in the same shape as in panneer Tikka. We thought that it would taste different.  Butter Rotis and Butter Kulcha was fresh and good but the Kulcha was of the same size as the Roti.  Masala Soda and Fresh Lime Water was fine, just regular stuff. Fresh Lime Soda was just horrible. It was extremely cold which is manageable but the taste was pathetic, guess the lime was rotten or something. It was so bad that I am taking a break from Lime Soda for a while.  All this costed about Rs.1000 for the 4 of us. We had been on a weekday for lunch. We were there by 12.30 so we had a choice to pick the table but by 1pm it was full and people were waiting so plan your visit accordingly."
3.0,"Kormangala Street the actual food hub of Bangalore. Not the street kind of food but with cafes, restaurants, pubs & fine dine kind of. After having south indian delicacies whole day stomach became homesick & craved for some north indian food. The search for it landed me to Gramin Restaurant. A village theme restaurant from outside only with a the modern amenities present inside. There were chair seating instead of traditional khat or langar seating. We ordered tomato soup, corn masaledar, dal makhani, paneer butter masala, masala papad & tandoori Roti's. As it was weekend & there was a good crowd waiting outside in que to eat after us the waiter was in a hurry to serve so couldn't click a single picture. Tomato soup was ok ok not that great which you get in North side. Corn masaledar was one of the best thing that we tasted that night(a must try). Rest all the items were at par. It was not pricey also. For north indian food at reasonable rates one can visit this joint for sure.  Overall Review  Ambiance - Okish Food - At Par Service - Too Fast"
4.0,"hi all, i visited this place with my family.We need to prebook for seats before only or else we need to wait outside.we ordered jal jeera,roti subzi which were good,ambience is retro theme not so bright lighting .But was good.they serve food brass,/ copper vessels."

4.0,Food is pretty good authentic North Indian taste specially a touch of Rajasthan........The right amount of spices.....The dal items are good and even paneer items are good The service is also good
1.0,.
5.0,"The only one place to have pure vegetarian  north Indian food in Bangalore. Taste 5 out of 5, ambience 3 out of 5 and Price is 4 out of 5. People must try Masala tea there"
3.0,I've had food from Gramins twice - once at the restaurant and once via delivery.  The food is served in good portions and relatives authentic. However I felt that there is too much of masala and artificial colours in the curries. The bhindi was good but the Paneer Butter Masala and paneer starters didn't realize impress much. The after taste was really bad because of the masala.  The ambience is nice for a small set up with a rural based theme and the service time is fine.
5.0,"Whenever I was in bangalore, no matter which area I was living in, this place was always on my mind when it came to eating yummy food. Whenever you are in search for vegetarian food, this is the go to place.   I have had some of the yummiest dinner at this place not once but many times. In-fact, I remember going there on my birthday too. The place is generally crowded on weekends but you can sit on the chairs around for sometime and you will get a seat in 4-5minutes. The interior is simple yet gives you authentic feels. Food- Now coming to the most important part, the food is delicious and they won't let you down anyday. I have tried gramin kofta, paneer handi, butter paneer masala. The food is served on time and the quantity is sufficient I would recommend you to try garlic naan and chilli roti too. the starters and simple and amazing. You can try on some lassi too. Service- It is quick and the waiters are humble. Price- Value for money. My verdict - You would love the place on first visit!!"
2.5,"Hmmm... Yeah... It's just 2.5.. On a personal note there's a strong reason to take off 1 point... ""AS MY PROPOSAL DIN GO WELL"" ... Now laugh at me... That's ok... I seriously don't remember what we ate... All I remember is food and the gal's response both were bad ... We ordered thali I guess... Lassi was not up to mark... Found a thin hair in chutney... Forget about the food... She paid the bill n said 'BYE'..."
3.0,it was good but not worth the price gramin is offering!
4.0,Vegetarian food at its best. Try thier dal varieties its always crowded. have patience and you will never regret it. Paneer and bhindi dishes are good sweet dishes can be tried.  Lunch hous are mostly crowded
5.0,It was my 1st order from gramin.and believe me 1st time in Bangalore I realized pure North Indian taste
1.0,"Worst experience ever! Spoiled our mother's day dinner as my mother is a vegetarian wanted to treat her with some good veg food, but to our surprise it was bad awful food with worst service ever as the waiter here have changed and also the kitchen staff may be. Food taste was awful and was not even warm but cold. Also after a long wait and advance orders placed they forget to serve a staple rice dish alongwith the food. Not going ever will also not recommend to others to go here as they (service) give you a very ugly look when you say something is wrong with their food.  Food 1/5 Service 1/5 Ambience 2/5 (please change your sofa cover as it has worn out and have discoloured) at least stand by the AWARD you guys are displaying at entrance, and train your staff to atlest respect the job they do. And be attentive.  Never going back! Worst experience ever."
1.0,"One of the best vegetarian restaurant in Bangalore would say , atleast the awards on the wall say so.been here earlier with good experience. This time it was a total mess , first up we waited for long time (40 mins ) that says the food is good, but it was the other way round in our case (worst experience ever) went there with misus. 2 kids, and mother in law (who is hardcore vegetarian) and visited us from Mumbai.You guys spoilt experience of mother's day  A guy without the uniform takes the advance order as we were waiting. Then we are seated with no waiters around (have to search for one and all new faces this time) . Then the starter arrived paneer Kurkure as the name suggests was crispy but dark brown almost black (should be golden brown) I guess? Then arrived the disaster kofta curry.. stone cold kofta with super sweet cold gravy(I know it's cashew gravy will be sweet but so sweet) and tasted raw dough felt like eating a hard gulab jamun gravy , dal Afghani was bit ok but again cold ... So our super  waiter forgot the advance order of jeera rice as my kid wanted to have it with dal and wanted to bring it when we were done with some how finishing our garlic kulcha(atleast this was good ) we said no we don't need it and he gave Us the look as if I asked him for his kidneys.  Then comes the best part the other waiter takes the remaining food as we were put off by the service (no water served after first serving even after asked by my mother) And then brings it packed and charged me for parcel which I never wanted and left it as we our evening was already spoiled.when I told him he again went to the floor supervisor who allocates the tables and he then explains me BBMP rule saying BBMP has asked them to charge the parcel .which we never wanted. Then the parcel charges waived off. And when I explained him the food story he said I should have told them earlier while eating . But SIR there was no waiter on the floor listening we have to chase them for our food.  Wait for 40mins Advance order taken before 20 min we sat. Food came out still late and waiter forgets one order which was for a kid.  Please improve on quality of service and food and just don't fill up your seat if you cannot deliver quality and consistency. After all its famous among the people who are not from Namma Bengaluru. Atleast respect this instead just making a extra buck in the rush of closing hour.  Its a dynamic industry ones failure is others gain Worst experience ever never going back here ."
4.0,This place is just located close to Forum malland easily accessible.  The place is a must go for he vegeterians. The gravies were prepared in Indian styles and alot of variety was there. There is almost waiting every time but it is worth waiting for the taste of food.  We were two people and orders Paneer Nawabi and Phulkas only. The food was really nice.  For ambience the place has been given a rustic look as per its name. Ya though the fans were on but I found the place a bit hot may be due to a lot of people there. The service was quick and prompt.
1.0,"the food was spoilt, got insulted in front of 10 guests"
1.0,"The food was stale, smelly and i had to throw out the whole food, got embarrassed in front of 10 guests, D graded food, sorry to say but does the restaurant have any etiquette"
5.0,Being a non-veg i prefer to have veg food very often. But this place is really nice. We ordered naan and gobi masala. Both were really tasty. Ambience also overwhelming. We liked the hospitality from staffs. Overall very nice. A must try veg place in bangalore.
4.0,"First thing you need to know about this place is that you need to go here with a little time, as you might have to wait a while before you get a table. But the wait is worth it. We ordered a tomato soup, a green salad, a veg seekh kabab, bhindi anardana, handi paneer, dal, chapati and plain rice. They have a few different kind of drinks like hari mirch soda and gulkand milkshake that we tried along with aam pana. Bhindi anardana and paneer are good and the quantity was enough for four of us. Seekh kabab was a little flat, so maybe try something from tandoor. Hari mirch soda was good and so was the panna. Gulkand milkshake was a little too sweet for my taste though. The service is good and the ambience lives UpTo it's name. A must visit place indeed."
3.0,"It is a nice and rustic place, in an old mall, Raheja Arcade. We were very early for dinner so got seated immediately. The service was prompt throughout the meal. We started of with Tomato Soup and Hara Bhara Kabab. Both were decent, nothing special but given my experiences in Bangalore so far, it was pretty good. For the main course we went with Achari Paneer and Phulka looking at Zomato recommendations, the paneer was bit too salty and tangy for our taste, wouldnt want to try it again, but the phulkas very good. To end the meal we went with the masala chaas which was also too spicy for us. But all in all the dinner went well, and after the initial disappointments with restaurants in Bangalore this is a positive note. Will recommend to folks who are in the area for good and affordable North Indian food."
5.0,"A true treat if you are in the mood for some delicious north indian food albeit vegetarian ;) Been her a couple of times and everything that I've ordered has been good. The service is really fast and cost is easy on the wallet too. Though on weekends, one has to wait for app 15 mins to get a table but it's totally worth it."
5.0,awesome
4.5,"Rustic, authentic, and quaint - these are the 3 words that come in my mind when I visit this place...  Like most of the other places here, you might have to face waiting time at this place as well, but the food is worth the wait...  They have an excellent collection of main courses, which will leave you lip-smacking till the very end..."
3.0,"Nice north indian food, but very ""hot"" by default. That way not kids friendly. If they can have option to have desired hotness to the food, will be really great. You cannot Dal Tadka, while you want to eat Dal Makhani"
2.0,Taste is totally different what i have ordered. Waste of money.
2.0,quality of rice used was poor
4.0,food was ok
3.0,The ambience was planned so well as per the traditional house of Rajsthan if I am not wrong. So eye-catchy you will love it at 1st sight. Divided in 2 floor upper floor with ground seatings are good. Situated inside a market building so parking here will be relatively easy. The crockery and glassware made of brass and copper which has so many good effects on your health.  Service was not up to the mark. I have visited the late lunch hour but for that you can't deny me the service. If you don't have much staff close your restaurant for sometime.  For food taken so many recommendation from my foodie friends. In food Lassi was yummy and for 80/- bucks I can't ask more. Paneer Balati / Balati Paneer was too good with huge chunks of soft cottage cheese immersed in thick tomato gravy. Which is little sour in taste but good overall. Now comes the disaster Rajsthani Bhindi / kurkuri bhindi heard so many positive things about it. Chef over fried it I think so. You can taste the burnt flavour. Kulcha - I can't stop my laugh if you are over with the dough please let me know that why you are serving me a round shaped naan. By the makki ki roti was good. So overall experience was not good. Will think over it to visit again and will try their Lunch Thali sometime soon.  Bon Appetit Chef BB                                             chefbb.in

4.0,good
5.0,classy
1.0,Much overrated. Ordered two thali's. Curries were too spicy & bit salty. Only thing I was able to eat was raita and roti (which was soft and wid butter).
5.0,totally loved the food and I over ate. it's a place that has waiting always maybe 40 minutes at time also so ensure you arrive accordingly. it's a must visit place for vegetarians. writing this review is making me crave for their food.
4.0,"4/5.. apart from the waiting time outside, everything else was good.. however, they have orders taken before hand so that you are served fresh hot food on the table.. expect a minimum wait time of 30minutes.. telephone reservations accepted.. we ordered for medium spice food,but we were served a bit spicy one for subzi and starter.. nice village house ambience as the name suggests."
5.0,"It has some really tasty food. I have been here twice. And I like the taste. On weekend, you might have to wait too long to get a seat but it's worth waiting. I remember having one dry karela dish. It was unique and quite tasty. We tried many things and they were all tasting great."
2.0,ordered dal makhani and kadhai paneer for parcel. dal didn't taste absolutely anything like a dal makhni while the capsicum in the over spicy kadhai was harder to chew than rubber. Hence deservedly 2 stars.
1.0,"I came to this place for the first time, because it is suggested me by someone. What could I say is it is the most pathetic customer treatment we could ever get. Firstly you have to order outside, what kind of stupidity if you can't just relax if you are paying. The person who is taking order has no manners to talk to the customer. He literally shouted on us, and told us if you don't want to eat here you can go and eat somewhere else. Never received and expected such gesture from any restaurant. JUSTTTT PATHETIC. REALLLYYY DISHEARTENING:((((((("
1.0,Totally disappointed with the customer service. The manager was too rude while taking orders and in reception. Too much attitude and zero humility. NEVER returning here.
5.0,"Gramin is a place close to Forum mall. The staff is very courteous and welcome you with a namaste when you enter. The decor and ambience takes you to a village in North India. We ordered Makki ki roti, butter kulcha, luccha paratha, channa masala, durbari paneer, chatka gobi, dal fry and to top it all a glass of sweet lassi. I loved every thing that was served and would love to go back again and try something different this time around. It's definitely one of the best North Indian veg restaurants in Bangalore. Go and experience it for yourself."
4.0,good
5.0,"This the best veg North Indian food served close to 2 decades..hav been there numerous times the food quality remains the same ..unique seating arrangements ,sometimes uncomfortable..but definitely visit any time."
4.0,"The restaurant is located in the posh area of Koramangala. The ambience and the seating pretty much looks alike a Dhaba or some Village.Water is served in Peetal Glasses and Old hindi melodies gives you a village feel.Staff is very courteous and Polite.Service is quick. As far as food is concerned,its quite good.You cannot compare it to some pretty good restaurant in North India but yes it is upto the expectations.I tried Bhindi and Dal Makhni which were pretty good.I didnt like the taste of Dal as it was too sour but they replaced it immediately. Tawa Rotis are also there in addition to Naans and Tandoori Roti. In Drinks Jal-jeera and Butter milk are must try.Over all a very good experience."
3.0,it was very spicy despite us giving an instruction that the food should be less spicy
2.0,bread ordered were with butter but what was delivered was without butter
4.0,"Having heard so much about the place, finally got a chance to visit this place 2 weeks back. Had to wait 30-40 mins on a Sunday eve. Ordered achari paneer and few breads along with. Food was yummy and had genuine north Indian flavor, would have rated 5 /5 only if that gravy did not have big chunks of achar. Service was prompt and Ambience was good. Really Liked the copper dishes. Try avoiding weekend rush for better experience."
5.0,V good
4.0,"Food is awesome, place is awesome, ppl are corporative, felt amazing to sit there and had sarson da saag with makki di roti. Service was quick, quantity is also fine. Yeah waiting time sucks specially when. you are feeling hungry."
4.0,"Well do you plan on getting lost in the bygone days of rustic ambience that dishes up authentic North Indian food, the Gramin is the place for you. Theyve homely, absolutely delicious food thats spiced well, and suits your pallete very well. And trust me the entire experience of the wooden chairs, and the brass plates just add to the deal. The service is also quite fast. So if youre in the mood for some good food thats easy on the pocket, served in good ambience this is the place to go."
4.0,"Tastes good, but the quantity is less, staff is quick, although, I liked the food and place and would visit again. Would give 4 star for quantity."
4.0,Gravies were really very good. Truly north Indian food.
1.0,Veg kadai was not good. There was no gravy but a lot of oil and some vegetables. Not worth for it. I deceived from the rating provided but the food is not worth for the money you pay.
2.0,Spicy food
1.0,waste taste less quantity not even worth 5prs dont know how zomato is carrying this type of resorent

1.0,extremely disappointed with delivery service
5.0,"This place made me happy. A frequent traveller, i miss authentic indian food, to be precise, ghar ka khana. but this place served me best of indian food at a reasonable price. Along with droolworthy food, eating food in a restaurant with nice ambience is a treat. Go visit this place.!"
5.0,My all time favourite place where you get amazing and super yummy tasty food. This has the best and tasty food preparations ever. Love the way they always serve hot chapatis. Even if there is a long waiting period you are able to place your order before hand and get immediate service after you get the table.
4.0,"A beautiful, quaint little place that deserves up some delicious north indian food! Its absolutely no fuss and hands down one of the best places in bangalore for yummy, heart north indian cuisine!"

3.5,"A must visit if you ate craving north Indian food and are in the koramangala vicinity. The outlet is located inside raheja arcade. There is usually a wait time during peak hours but the wait is worth it. The hara Bara kabab is soft and well made, most of the gravies are made in a true North Indian style. Also a must try is their butter milk"
5.0,"Took phulka, Panner butter masala and baby corn masaladar... Food was hot when delivered and very delicious."

5.0,"Well Im not a vegetarian person and I rarely go to only veg places, but went to this one on a friends suggestion. I love Gramin and how ! The theme of this place is village and you get all desi kinda food. From chas to lassi , makki roti to Palak da saag , finger licking good. Had karela sabji as well ,too good. We went there at 7.30pm and it was already full . By 9 people were standing in a queue. So you know how good is this place. Trust me !                                                                 instagram.com"
1.0,"I didn't enjoy having dinner here, went with my wife after seeing good review but disappointed with the taste of the food...left almost all the items. (we ordered corn soup, mix veg soup, bharwan paneer tikka, paneer handi, dal makhani, butter roti)"
4.0,"The place is mostly crowded during the weekends but the queue moves faster,good management skills and great food, a must visit for vegetarians.We tried starters like paneer kurkure amd seekh kebabs both were excellent and paneer kurkure was as crispy as the name suggests, good place to have ""chaach"" and lassi, we also tried their gramin special gravy and it was great as well.Overall an excellent experience and worth a regular visit. The rates are also affordable."
1.0,the food was tasteless.. the taste of soap was  coming from daal n Curry. ultimately food was tasteless.... waste of money
5.0,"Ghar ka khane! food that tastes like your mum's food! it's really easy to make such claims, but next to impossible to actually achieve it. Well team Gramin take a bow... because you have achieved it and are maintaining it.  I stay in Bangalore away from home and miss those soft hot ghee phulkas that I'd get at home so much that it's hard to express...but today when I had lunch at Gramin I just ended feeling at home... maybe not as good as my mom's because well who can deny the fact that moms are the best.   but on a serious note...if you are craving for some simple home style food, plz visit Gramin.  Favourites from the drinks menu:  Thadai  Aam panna (I would have liked it to be a bit more tangy, but anyway that's a personal choice)  Jal jeera  Masala buttermilk  winner: Jal jeera   Favourites from the food menu:  Dahi bhindi  Gramin special biryani  daal makhni  hara bhara kebab  Paneer bhurji  mixed breads ( naan, lachcha paratha and ghee phulkas)  winner: Dahi bhindi and ghee phulkas"
4.5,"Best place for vegetarians.Lovely ambience ,food is really awsome  and they have good options in menu with reasonable pricing. Attentive staffs .Overall experience was really satisfactory .Must try place"
5.0,Been here twice and both the times the food was greattt. The thali is so filling and a complete value for money. The staff is courteous. Unique interiors. Perfect place to visit if you are craving for ghar ka khana
5.0,"Whenever I want to have nice food, Gramin is the first name that pop up in my mind. I visit here regularly..  Veg seek Kabab and Mix veg soup are must try here. I really enjoy dining here... Staff is polite, service is fast. It is a well managed veg restu. It has lots of variety and drinks here are really really nice..  I think every vegetarian or non-vegetarian as well must try dining here at least once.."
4.0,Always a pleasure to visit this place. Ambience : 4.5/5 Food Quality : 4/5 Food Quantity : 4/5  A good authentic Indian veg cuisine with an ambience corresponding it's name.
4.0,"This is really good place to enjoy the veg dishes.. My personal choice is bendi fry and kaju masala with butter roti. Ambience is too good, feeling like eating food @ home. service is really good."
5.0,"One of the best places for authentic veg North Indian spicy food, their Chatka Gobi is delicious. Have been here many times and never get bored. Restaurant is always full because of their tasty delicious food."
4.0,We went here after a movie . This place is really awesome for vegetarians . Has a lot of variety . Food was good and ambience complemented it .
3.0,"This restaurant is located very much close to forum mall in Raheja Arcade.  A completely vegetarian North Indian style restaurant with village theme.  Interior, ambience and serving all are in village style.  They serve all different dishes of a typical North Indian Hotel with some village type of dishes. There is flexibility where you can decide whether you want spice, cream or oil etc in your dish or not.  But it lacks variety of dishes that was needed for a village themed restaurant though the quality was good and quality was sufficient  Hotel was very hygiene with very fine washroom ( Foreign style here  not village )  Being a non vegetarian I felt like somewhat less taste and village taste was missing.  A nice restaurant recommended for vegetarian with good ambience and shopping points in front of hotel.  Overall good experience."
3.5,"Location - next to punjab grill on kormangala. This place takes you back to the rural India feel. The decor is something that you will notice as soon as you enter the place. Coming to food, its average with traditional Indian desi food being served. But, this place definitely has the best lassi in town- that thick concoction with the goodness of curd... In one word, yummy. I also loved punjabi pane er, which was kinda  like the comfort food of home. It's a good vegetarian restaurant well within budget."
3.0,It's good
1.0,Thali Packaging wasnt good. Also sabzi were tasteless. Gulab jamun was hard
1.0,Burnt food .. not in a condition to eat. Entirely waste of money.
4.0,Had been to this place as part of corporate team outing. Decent food and decent prices . Seating arrangement is a bit congested but overall good place .
5.0,"Reasonable price , veggie friendly...  starters are awesome . Tried all the starters and all r good . Aam panna is my all time favorite . Lunch thali is also good . Ambience- 4/5 Food- 5/5"
4.0,"Gramin is a name itself for people to have typical Indian food.... Though the ambiance is fully gramin(village) type it facilates Everything with modern touch in gramin style...More of it looks like Rajasthani style ambiance as per my perception...Still it's beautiful.. When it comes to food....It's pure vegetarian restaurant...And still rush is never ending... Can't believe..Even in Banglore, so many veg lovers still exists  Initially I ordered in starters: 1.HARABHARA KABAB: It was good in taste.lil dry I felt but Tastewise ...It was pretty good  2. Babycorn paneer crispy: It was really good in taste but it was more spicy ...So mixed Feeling for this dish...Try out ...Once... Main course: Ordered 1.Dahi bhindi .. crispy bhindi fully covered with Dahi and tadka on top lovely dish... 2. Paneer Handi: It was good in taste and quite good in Quantity.... 3. Ordered roti and special chapati... It was good enough to eat.... Delicious Sabji.. 4. Curd rice...At last I ordered curd rice.... It was good in taste... Along with all I ordered buttermilk...Which is very highlighted and popular drink of GRAMIN... So I took buttermilk along with it.. It was wonderful visit..Having lunch in Gramin.."
4.5,Absolutely fantastic food. We waited about 20 mins even though we reached at12.15 on asunday. Their lassi is one of the best. there are very few veg options in this part of the town and this place is truly the best.
4.5,We had to wait for more than 40 mins to get in. It it was worth the wait. The ambience was like a village dhaba and the food was delicious! It's a paradise for vegetarians!
4.0,Calm & quiet place to enjoy the evening with your own space. Very quick and prompt service. Staffs are really amazing. & food they are just bliss. (Quantity is really good)
4.5,"Amazing hospitality, great  food,  all in all great place for vegetarians and affordable.  The staff is very courteous and friendly . The starters and lunch thali is very good"
4.0,A destination that you have to reach out for a delicious veg meal. The quantity is filling for a person and serves a large variety of items. They also serve some good drinks and starters which is not part of the regular menu. For veg food it's the best place with traditional seating and beautiful service.
4.0,"At the heart of Koramangala, this is the best vegetarian place to be. Pocket friendly. Delicious starters esp Chatka Gobhi was so soft and delicious... Main course were nice and portions were good.. Garlic naan was nice too.. water in copper glass gets additional points.."
3.5,This is a great place for Vegetarian's. True to its name the place has a rural setting. Food quality and taste is great. Make sure to get reservations in advance as the place is crowded most of the time.
3.5,"I really kinda liked the whole set up and design of the place, I'm surprised bot many people know about it. The food tastes good, but the only.issue is that the portions are too small for the price they charge."
4.0,"This place is small and neat.  The feeling is of a nice Brahman house.  The food is great, Thali had variety of food and it's worth the money. Ambience - 4/5  Value for money - 4/5"
4.0,Craving for some North Indian food? This is a perfect family place to  have your north indian meal! It's a small place in raheja arcade serving some authentic Indian food. Pocket friendly place with variety of Indian vegetarian food. There are many places which do not serve Jain food and gramin serves Jain food! I love their north indian food. It's a must try when you are looking for good North Indian food which is not very expensive.
4.0,"Simple & comfortable ambiance in bright colors giving it rural feel , if you are vegetarian n like north Indian food gramin is value for money place ... crispy lady fingers , haryali kabab , daal makhni ....wash it down with masala buttermilk or opt for mirchi soda :-) waiting period is very high"
4.0,One of the best place to have pure veg food. Taste of the food is authentic and also have variety of items. A quite nice place to come with your family. Service is good but sometimes delays to serve. Need little improvement.
3.5,"I've visited this place twice so far.  Ambience - As the name goes, the place has a village (gram) like feel. Drinks - They serve aam panna which is a tangy mango drink and tastes great. Food - Honestly, I found the food to be pretty average.  We ordered typical stuff - dal makhani, paneer etc and taste was okay. Service - The service is quick and staff is courteous"
4.0,"Since 2011, I am a regular to this place.  Ambiance Comfy I really love the look and feel of this place.  Music Boring Since 2011, the playlist hasnt changed. Its high time playlist needs an update.  Food Good I have tried out many dishes at this place. The thali is really wholesome and tasty.It could makeup for a nice brunch.I love the Gulab Jamun. For starters, I love their Lasooni Paneer and Hara Bhara Kebab. For Main, I like their rotis and Punjabi Dhaba curry, Handi Biryani and Gramin Biryani. My personal favourite is Mirch Ka Salan. The chillies caused a riot in my mouth. Recommended only for those who have a high spice tolerance.  Disliked Pudina Roti Veg Korma Veg Kolhapuri  Drinks Sweet Lassi Masala Butter Milk- very refreshing during summer  Menu Though they had upgraded the menu and added many dishes. I still feel there is room for improvement. Maybe,somemore dishes could be added to the rice section.  Overall, I am a happy and satisfied customer. Keep it up guys."
4.5,"Haven't got a table on the first floor, if I would get a table on the second floor; ai would rate 5  Recommended, if you are planning to have dinner do visit at 8:00 as it will be over crowded.  Ordered: Double thadka daal: 4.5 Malai kofta: 4 Methi Biriyani: 4 Boondi Raita: 4.5 Jeera rice: 4.5 Corn Biriyani: 4  I would really recommend you to try the combination of daal tadka with Jeera rice, you will really love it.  If you are a fan of Malai kofta then you can really try, I liked it with the methi biryani."
5.0,"Amazing vegetarian food; rustic ambience; quick service; ""Gramin"", in every sense of the word except the price. :-)  Jokes apart it is a premium price, but worth every penny for the experience offered.  Food is served in earthen and copperware and glasses adding to that rustic village feel.  Parking is the only problem, but it is big enough to not have me frequent this place as often as I'd like to."
3.5,"Very near to Forum mall. Service good thali. I had been with my friends , thali was good, interiors are like an village house setup. Good one ."
3.5,My exposure to punjabi food for been spent 5 yrs in Delhi and been to punjab and over that 22 yrs lived in bhopal..i can bet for sure..i hav fair idea of punjabi taste..I feel even though the food was good it lacked that punjabi punch..i felt it on dull side..seems it is a sophisticated urban class low fat punjabi diet food..1 try is nevertheless recommended.
4.0,"Ambience: Cute, you will get village kind of feeling   Service is good. Pure veg restaurant. Food was tasty and very pocket friendly.   Must try is their thali."
2.5,"I went to this restaurant last week by reading below all goods reviews. But overall experience was not that great.   Ambience is good, staff was courteous but main purpose of visit FooD was not that great. We ordered soups and it was very thick with some coconut pury, yak. In paaneer tikka masala, paaneer was stale and I was finding it difficult to cut in small pieces. Chaas was good but you simply don't visit a restaurant to have chaas.  Overall, it was OK OK experience. Guys, beware below of the reviews are misleading to some extent. Dont have a high expectation and things will be fine."
4.5,"Food: 4.5/5. If you are a vegetarian looking for some north Indian flavour, this is the right place. They have a wide range of food items. In case you are lost in between that huge menu card, don't hesitate to ask for the staff's expert advice. However, the restaurant needs to focus on their dessert preparation.  Ambience: 4.5/5 The entire place gives you an antique feel and serves food in copper plated dinner sets. It qualifies to give it's diners the ""Gramin"" experience.  Service: 4.5/5 Friendly and responsive staffs. Food preparation time is comparatively lesser than it's counterparts.  Affordability: 4/5  Must have: Lassi and the hara bhara kabab."
4.5,Very reasonable price and very veggie friendly. Starters are very tasty and overall impression was very good but waiting  time was more. It was a good one
4.0,"Excellent. Gramin is a combination of great taste and reasonable cost. What adds up to the experience is the ambience... Simple and beautiful. The food... Try out the babycorn starters and paneer.. they taste delicious. They have a variety of curries to choose from and are worth trying. Do try out gramin kofta which is really tasty. Try out jaljeera here, which is tangy and slurp worthy. Maybe you would need to wait a little here, because it is a busy restaurant but the waiter would take your order while waiting and you would be served then. Do try this place out. Recommended."
4.5,Visited with friends..  Ambience is good and food is tasty..   Starters : Paneer ( quite spicy but tasty)  Main course : butter Naan with handi Paneer masala (amazing masala)  and kadai Paneer. Jeera rice (perfect blend).  Sweet : Pineapple Raita (though I funny like Raita but this drew my attention and was quite good)   Ambience : 4.5/5 Service : 4 /5 Food : 4/5 Cheers guys!!!
4.0,"Dear Gramin, you missed 5.0 just because there was a cockroach near to my wall. Don't worry this is, one of the best vegetarian restaurants you might find which also is light on your pockets. Give it a try and this restaurant will be in your list during the month ends. Loved the food guys, pls look after your cockroaches well."
4.0,"If you're looking to dine at a vegetarian restaurant in Koramangala then Gramin is a good option. It's been there since years, and their food tastes great. There are a lot of options on the menu to pick and choose from. I'd recommend their Thali, Veg Handi and Paneer Tikka Masala. Also opt for their Phulkas instead of Rotis."
2.5,"This was not my first visit to Gramin. Usually the food here is good, but this time I was very disappointed by the quality of food. We ordered tandoori stuffed potato, lahsuni Paneer Tikka, Malai Kofta and breads. Stuffed Potato was satisfactory but other dishes were a let down. Kofta was very hard and tandoori roti was severely udercooked."
4.0,"This is heaven for Veg lovers. I've tried starters , Main course, drinks everything here and every single dish is simply superb.  To name a few, Gobho Chataka, Lasooni Paneer Dhuendar and Hara bhara kabab are must try starters. In main course, if you are bored of having paneer everywhere else, try Spicy Koftas here. In drinks Pudina Khatta Meetha is what I prefer."
2.0,"I really don't understand the reason behind their high ratings. We visited this place for dinner on a Sunday night and it was crowded. I had made a reservation for a table of 10 via call and reached on time. But, they have no reservation system in their restaurant and seating is on first come first serve basis. So even though, we had a reservation and reached at the specified time, we were asked to wait outside for nearly 30 minutes. Besides, while we waited, we had to look through the menu and order before hand what we needed and the guy taking the order seemed arrogant and indifferent to the crowd/customers . They don't have a separate waiting lobby or anything and you will have to sit on pigeon dropping stained chairs laid out in the sitout area of the shopping complex. It was fine until here.  Finally, we were called in and ushered to a crowded, dim lit restaurant with gaudy rajasthani hangings and paintings. Extremely noisy place and the managers don't bother about maintaining any sort of decent atmosphere despite them claiming to be an upscale restaurant. I frankly found the atmosphere to be obnoxious and frivolous just like a petty local restaurant. Even before we could make ourselves comfortable, we were served with all the starters we had ordered and all of them cold and rubbery! Apparently, they prepare your order the moment you tell them and by the time it reaches you (due to the waiting time) the food is all cold, dull and seriously odourless. I am a person who likes to enjoy the food I have, taking in the aroma, presentation and ambiance. I could have probably compromised on that aspect if atleast the taste had been good. The taste was just bland and one of the starter was just spicy - nothing else! They have lost the essence of Indian cuisine altogether. Even before we could stuff in all the cold starters and gulp down the COLD soup, the main course was dumped on the table. All of them cold including the rotis! I mean chewy, rubbery, cold rotis definitely doesn't need any mention now, do they?! Horrible.  This fad among north Indian restaurants is to have curries with different names on the menu but all prepared with the same masala. We had ordered a few forgettable curries which tasted exactly the same with different vegetables/ paneer. Tasted ok. The rice was good for a change but curd rice was plain disgusting and we guessed it was prepared long back and kept in the refrigerator and served without thawing. We had no patience for desserts which were exorbitantly priced and walked out. The managers were even more glad that we didn't take longer to order desserts. They were waiting with the bills and wanted  us to leave. One cannot spend any extra time here without getting dirty stares from their staff. Ughh!  Service was good and the 2 stars are only for the waiters who responded to our requests in kannada, and obliged with everything that we wanted. Massive disappointment and would never ever go back here. You could probably drop in here if you are in that locality on a weekday and if you are ok with sub par North Indian cuisine. One of the worst in bangalore!"
4.0,It was a decent experience and a recommend place for veg lovers.  Must Try: Harabhara Kabab (Dal & Bhindi fry was average)  Ambience: 3/5 Taste: 3.5/5 Service: 4/5   Worth giving a try go for it...
5.0,"Simple delicious food, courteous service & old-school ambiance. Simply amazing. The highlights were the prompt service, the 'gramin' decor & the classic (and I mean CLASSIC) songs that they play! A must-visit for all kinds of people"
4.5,"So I had been here and tried a lot of stuff like harebare kebab, fried corn, raitas, Roti Curry and lots of stuff it was very delicious and worth it!! The ambience is also amazing so loved it"
3.5,A very decent place to get ur north Indian food fix.. d thali was pretty good.. d service could've been a little better and it took us good half an hour to get a table.. the bhindi dish was probably one of best I've had ever..! That's quite something as my mom's bhindi is one of d best.. If u around d place do visit for hearty lunch..
4.0,The value for money is amazing. The ambience is great with interesting seating and colourful decor. The Indian setting goes well with the food served. The service is quick and efficient. It's a good place for veggietarians. The choice of food is ample. The handi tadka dal was absolutely delicious. The pulav and jaljeera are tasty.
3.5,"This is a very old restaurant, i feel nostalgic going there, if you are around Koramangala and the surrounding areas and you are craving for some good veg food then this is definitely a place to try.  The only problem with this place is the waiting time, it would have been good it they would have done something about the seating, nevertheless i love how they serve the food in the copper vessels, they have a pretty decent ambiance which gives you a village feel.  Veg Thali, Veg Handi, Pudina Khatta Meetha, Paneer Kadhai, Nimbu Shikan ji are some of my favorites, do try the lassi as well...!!!! Good Veg food :)"
4.5,"After skipping couple of places due to long waiting, we came down to this place hoping for a less crowd. But we were quite shocked to see a good amount of crowd already waiting before us. But we decided to stay and wait as we had heard some good feedback for the food and hospitality the place offers. Must say we were very impressed by the gesture of the person we met at the entrance for reservation when he welcomed us. And since it was quite crowded, he asked us to confirm the food items so the waiting time can be cut down and so we did. And as he promised, he got us a table in 15 mins. The place looked a bit small at first glance but the tables were perfectly managed. The decor wasn't as exciting but the food and the hospitality of the staff filled the void what decor lacked.   We had ordered Stuffed Potatoes and Paneer Kurkure for starters, Kesar Lassi, Paneer Achari, one more Paneer sabzi of which I don't recall the name and Bread Basket for main course. And each of these items were amazingly delicious; especially the Kesar Lassi.  The person we met at entrance came down to our table couple of times and asked for feedback on food and hospitality, which I found very professional and attentive of him.  It was, all in all, a great experience and with no doubt I would suggest my friends to visit this place and have the same experience I had."
5.0,"Awesome. Very fresh vegetarian food. I went there several times (at least five times). Mainly tried Ghar ki subzi, Aloo Gobi, Sarso ka saag etc. Very good decor. Awesome hospitality."
1.0,packing was not good.half of daal fry leaked
5.0,The food was amazing... The phulkas especially... Too good... Paneer butter masala was the winner.. the ambiance is wonderful.. very apt for a family lunch... Big fat thumbs up to the service
4.5,"One of the best places for vegetarian food. Ordered Butter Naan, Malai Kofta, Butter Milk and Lassi (must try). Good service, large portions and excellent food. Will definitely go back here again!"
5.0,I can rate this as one of the best vegetarian restaurants in Bangalore ... The variety the choice we get here is vast and the taste also is great and spice lovers it a must visit place...The service is excellent and the food presentation is good and the place is pretty crowded .. I would always recommend anyone going toward kormangala to try this restaurant
2.0,Very overpriced and over rated restaurant.. i wanted to try good veg food and a friend suggested this place..we were 2 people and ordered 2 starters (gobi and babycorn masala) and cornpulao in maincourse..food was not good..
3.5,Ethnic ambiance. The food is decent and staff are courteous. The service is fast so u dont have to wait long for ur food :-). Overall a must visit for a vegetarian.
2.0,"Ambience is ok, but not very hygienic. We found a bug in the main course curry. When we complained to the waiter and asked him to call his manager. The manager was very rude to the waiters spoiling the mood."
2.0,Went with my family for dinner. Ambience was good.. proper village style But was disappointed with the quality of food. Ordered Malai Kofta and Dum Aloo. Both were not cooked as per expectation.
3.5,Food was good though the variety in dishes was not great. The theme 'Grameena' has been executed well but could have been better. Staff are kind and friendly. They were courteous enough to let us in and order even though we went few minutes after closing time. Overall a good place.
4.5,"With great food and a proper north Indian ambiance it is a good place to visit, it has great north Indian food and is very budget friendly place."
5.0,"Beautiful rustic ambiance of the restaurant will help you cherish their delightful cuisine. If you are looking for a bellyful of goodness and a heartful of happiness without pinching a hole in your pocket, this is THE place you should hit. From thalis to different cuisines, this place has it all."
4.0,Good vegetarian food. Some really good tasting dishes. The menu is neat. Service is fast and dishes are yum! It on the ground floor of the arcade. Right opposite to the entrance. It has 2 floor seating. They also offer special birthday celebration offers. They have a bread basket with 4 types of bread. Decent pricing. May be a bit on the expensive side but its good.
5.0,"We went to Gramin last night for some hot North Indian cuisine.  I've always enjoyed exploring the menu at this restaurant. I know I can always come here for a wholesome hot meal!   Ambience- I love the effort they have put into the decor and the feel of the place.  The  restaurant has an upstairs and a downstairs with walls full of decor. The restaurant has the feel of a village hut. The cutlery and the food in which the plates are served have a copper finish reminding one of the old times when food used to be cooked fresh and served.  The ambience certainly adds to the experience!   Service and staff - As always, the service is extremely fast and there is always some one to wait at your table.  The staff is very hospitable, helpful and ensures that the dish you've ordered meets your requirements ( what your preferred spice level is for the spicer dishes).  They are extremely cordial and make sure they help you before you can ask for anything.   Food- I have always enjoyed the quality of food here. I have been a loyal visitor as I've found the quality has never dropped since I've come, regardless of the dish I've ordered ( and I usually try to order a new dish every time I go)  This time we ordered a Paneer Kolhapuri, along with kulchas (ghee walas). My friend ordered naan, and we shared tomato soup.    We love the tomato soup here as it isn't too citric or heavy. It tastes home made! As always the quantity we ordered was just right. We found the Kolhapuri curry pretty spicy, but I enjoyed it.  If you aren't fond of spicy food , you can ask them to reduce the spice level.   Overall, I shall definitely come here again to try some more curries.   Other recommendations:  Masala pappad, paneer tikka starter."
3.5,"Always busy place this is! Preparation is consistently good (but nothing exceptional) and price is bit on higher side considering the locality (opposite forum mall) they are based out of. Service is ok but make sure you come early to reserve your table as waiting time is high. Cut 1.5 stars as serving quantity for curries is always very less and the idea is we ultimately have to order more, which is dissapointing. Also no parking available."
4.5,"A place where I get really good food, in low prices in bangalore. It's a veg only place. It's good for regular eating, not a fine dine place. Their baingan ka bharta is my fav.  This place get crowded very soon and you can spot long waiting. Going early is the key to enjoy food here, if you don't want to wait in the queue."
2.5,"Got a chance to visit this place with friends yesterday... my expectations were high as I heard lot of good things about this place  - Ambiance: Ambiance is good... Gives a feel of village - Staff is friendly and service was fast - We ordered Paneer Kadai Masala: Not upto mark, no flavours or taste except Black pepper Tawa Roti: Good soft roties Gulab Jamun: felt not fresh  My visit to this place and my first experience with them was not good but as I heard a lot of good things from other, would like to visit again once and try their food"
4.0,Finally got chance to try the home style food at Koramangala!! It took almost 10 years for me to come here !! Studying working in same area but never tried here !!   Lovely food and service I can say one of the best in the area !! Quit hygiene and quick on service side.   Only complaint is increase the seating area so waiting time can reduce.   Anyways Thanks for the great lunch.
3.0,"Been here for the same old thali, but had not expected the same old geera rice, which I eat that all the time of my visit to this outlet, wr the menu tells, variety rice of the day, but I haven't tasted any other than this rice"
4.0,I went here for my birthday. The food is good in respect of both quality and quantity. The ambience is nice. Since I went on Sunday it was very crowded. It's advisable to reserve table in advance. One must go once at least. It's worth every penny!
4.5,mostly its very spicy foods. Spicy level is also mentioned in menu for each dishes. Dishes are good but its for spicy food lovers. i loved gobi starter not sure of its name but it looked like gobi chilly fry
4.0,Homely north Indian food... efficient staff & reasonably priced Thaali. Expect heavy rush and long waiting during peak office lunch-break so avoid if you want a quiet meal! (They serve buttermilk which is awesome; don't miss)
3.5,"Good but not best... Location is good, ambience is ok ok... Staff are not much friendly... Bread are not so great, stater is ok. 1time visit...."
4.5,"Location 4/5 Ambiance 5/5 Food 4/5 Service 4/5 Value for Money 5/5  Gramin had been one of the torch bearers of vegetarian food in Koramangla who has stood tall maintaining it's price and quality despite cut throat competition in this area.  Veg Thali, Veg Handi, Pudina Khatta Meetha, Paneer Kadhai, Nimbu Shikan ji are to die for. You can choose from a low lie sitting to usual table chair. Super fast service from ever smiling waiters with a fresh aroma of spice to make food delectable. Earthern Ambiance mixed with retro bollywood music up the appeal of this place.  Even the plates n glasses  used is made of copper  and looks royal. Must visit for any vegetarian in Bangalore.  Only challenge here is lack of parking space and long waiting time. But in the end it is all worth it."
4.0,"It is very good pure vegetarians restaurant. It is as humble as it's name and serves super tasty food without adding too much masala or oil.  Staff is very courteous and prices are reasonable. Ambience is humble and I loved it's simplicity.  The only issue is with parking, I hope they will try to solve it soon.  Awesome place for people looking good north indian ghar ka khana type, pure veg restaurant.  Thali is must try and phulkas are so good :)"
5.0,The best roti I have ever had in my life ... stuffed roti is the best in the world ... service is good and order is given very quickly  Lassi is also very good
4.5,The most inviting place of vegetarian! I just love the food here. I am a vegetarian and I really love and recommend this place to have some delectable food. This place do the justice with the name.  It is located in the most happening Koramangala area inside the Raheja Arcade. The ambience is like a proper village feel. It is not very huge place and there ll mostly be waiting during peak hours.  They serve food in copper vessels. Proper thali n copper glass. Service is good and as it is non AC so just 5% tax (sgt 2.5 and cgt 2.5) you hv to pay there  Coming to the food arbi kabab is most mouth watering and my own favourite. Bharwa paneer tikka must try there.  Hara bhara kabab is really good it just melt in the mouth. If you don't want too spicy subjiyan you can ask them. We have tried gramin kofta which was good but have margin to improve as I find all the gravy taste bit similar. Kaaju masala nd paneer tikka masala is my favourite. Definitely have there Mango panna and nimbu ki shikanji.
4.5,Lovely North Indian food. I usually used to go to this place. Ambience and food is really good but the only problem is service is very slow. I would strongly recommend this place especially to North Indian in Bangalore.
4.0,"We went for a birthday party here, ordered so many items, taste was good and service is also good. Ambiance is awesome. Only thing i dont like here is food was not served hot. Even curries which we ordered at that time was also not hot."
4.0,Good and clean place. I like the food. The thali is good. Ambience is pretty good and different. Lassi was worth a buy. Overall a happy and good place for lunch or dinner.
1.0,asked for green chutney specifically but wasn't provided
1.0,Took 30 mins to get a table. Food was very average. And the worst part - writing this review while waiting (since about 5 mins) for my next serving of breads...need I say more? And finally.... there was a small piece of stone in my dahi bhindi :(
4.5,Good place for veg lovers. Served delicious food at affordable price. Try once if you are heading towards koramangala and it is walkable distance from forum mall
3.0,"Ambience was good and food was okay. But the staff was rude and the service was really slow. I would say that the ambience was the only favorable thing, rest they need to improve."
4.5,"It is one of my preferred places for veg food, it is simple and delicious. Be it be the phulkas, paneer gravy, raita, lassi, everything was good."
4.5,"Typical ""North Indian"" restaurant. Had a warm welcome. Ambiance was delightful. Food was tasty. Reasonable pricing. Great option for a weekend lunch given you want a regular tasty North Indian meal."
3.0,"Nice variety of food, but too greasy and spicy for my liking. Food was not very fresh either. But its a nice place to grab a quick meal if you are planning to watch a movie at Forum Mall. Be warned though, the queues get crazy during weekends."
4.5,"The food here is mouth watering, very very flavorful! I return for their dal tadka, I just love it. Everything that I have ordered till date here has been good :) I like their Lasooni Paneer as well. Definitely suggest this place."
4.0,"Had been to this place today order thali, hakka Biryani and paneer babycorn allahbad all the dishes were gud and interior was gud too  the service and ambience was gud for veg lovers this place is must visit :-)"
4.0,"Value for money: 4 Good dinner place with nice crowd. Will mostly be queued for dinner.  Good: Gulkand milk shake, anjeer milk shake, aloo paratha Ok: Tandoori paneer starter Avoid: -  Service: 3.5/5 Ambience: 4/5  No. of visits: 2"
2.0,"Ambience was good. Even though we reserved the seat we had to wait for more than 15-20 minutes.   Service was good and staff were polite n friendly.  But food was the biggest disappointment, all the food served were too salty for our taste. Way above acceptable level.  Overall a nice place for family lunch or dinner. Food is priced well."
4.5,"Quick service, large portions and rich taste definitely make Grami a no fail choice for Indian food! Despite being a hardcore carnivore, this vegatarian joint makes it to my list of favourite restaurants! The Jaljeera and Buttermilk are nice. The Dal Fry, Veg Kolhapuri, Paneer Handi, Baingan Bharta (yes, Baingan!) and Kandhari Aloo are highly recommended and will definitely prompt you to visit again!"
5.0,"This is most visited place for me in kormangala. Everything is great here. Ambience is great, food is great, service is great ... Bhindi fry and lassi is my favourite here . It's really a good choice for vegetarians in kormangala. The only not so good thing of this place is that you have to wait a long time if you are planning to visit during weekends!!! Nevertheless you will not regret for waiting for so long time once you start your food."
3.5,"Since 2011,I have been a regular to this place.The place never disappoints. My favourites are Handi Biryani, Paneer Lassoni,Masala Buttermilk,Punjabi Dhaba Curry.  A suggestion would be to include more varities,to the rice section. It would be nice to give the menu,a twist and add some more exciting dishes.Maybe,change the music too. Anways,they are one of the best veg places in town."
5.0,"The staff is very humble. Great veg. North Indian food, must visit place. There's usually a waiting here, but the service is quick. Also, they customise the flavours if you request them- more spicy or less, for example."
3.5,"This was recommended by one of my friends. Me and my guy went here for lunch for his birthday!  With high expectations, we ordered shikha Kabab which was barely cooked. The Paneer gravy we ordered didn't contain so many Paneer. Rotis were soft. It didn't match how my friend explained me, yet can try once!"
4.5,"Most value for money, Very good, helpful, polite staff. The taste is excellent, affordable. Service is very fast , if there is queue outside , then they take the order in advance , so that when you get seat , your order is served super fast , which is a very good thing , All in all one of the best places for Vegetarians to dine out."
4.5,"One of the best place to eat veg food. You will found well prepare dishes here. I tried Dahi Bhindi, Aloo Baby corn in starters, Lemon soda, double tadka daal and ghee phulka. They also serve you mouth watering Green Chatni and it is worth having there, because there are too less Restaurant I found the proper recipe and here it is. They'll serve you in retro style dish and background music. For those who are craving to have home made food this place is for you guys. Go and check it out. Will visit again. Must go."
1.0,Food was not spicy. Instead it had lot of chilli in it. It made the Kashi and butter milk uneatable. Naan were not had and had rubbery feel. Had lot of expectations. Won't recommend to anyone. Also the food was delayed because of the extra time taken by the kitchen.
4.0,"This is one of the pocket friendly place where we often end up on the month ends   The staff is quite helpful in menu selection & the host also does the crowd control well by taking your orders in advance so that you dont have to wait for your food inside.  The ambience is well quite & food is good on all accounts, i love the crockery they use which make the experience more authentic.  Dal tadka, ghee phulka, carry panna are must try.  Bon appetite"
4.0,Quick service friendly staff and good North Indian  food. Thanks Team Gramin. Keep it up. The Shikanji was oversweet though. Pl improve on that. Will surely visit again.
4.5,"Simple Ambience but have a great things to offer such as friendly staff, tasty food and a good place to spend with family or friends. If you're a vegetarian and looking for a good place to dine in koramangala then this a place to go. Ambience - Unique Food - excellent Service - Excellent Cost for 2- 600"
3.5,"Good sort of place ,dark theme  inside the raheja arcade.Food is ok, not that great but still yu can try. So it's like a one time hangout place."
4.0,Food is little bit over spicy. Easy to find location. Food is   good & pure veg. Paneer kadai is must try. Veg thali tests good..   wait time is less that's a big thing
5.0,Totally worth every penny spent.  Menu is unparalleled i bangalore for the quality food they serve.... You'll get to know about it once you reach there on a weekend in even afternoon... You'l have to wait in the queue for about an hour because of the rush.  Tried multiple items... Make sure that you order vegetable dishes of different kind beacause the gravies are much similar in taste. Budget friendly.... I took 8 of my friends on a treat and it costed me 2400 only....and they were not even able to finish off the food completely.  Heaven for vegetarians.
4.0,The long waitlist at Gramin hints at the popularity of its food. Its the perfect place to satisfy your craving for a north indian meal. It would be great to have a dessert section added to the menu.
3.0,"Been to Gramin recently during a weekday and the place was completely full during lunch service. For a long time I was planning to visit this place and finally got the chance. The place looks like a small village but the ceiling is very low. The place serves North Indian Vegetarian food only. Most of the folks around me had ordered the Veg Thali but I wanted to explore the ala-carte menu.  We ordered the Paneer Kolhapuri and the Navratan Korma along with few rotis. The order took a bit longer than usual but finally arrived after a wait of 15mins. The Paneer Kolhapuri was spicy and had a tomato based gravy. The gravy was spicy but we could taste the raw tomato in it. The gravy was not cooked to the perfection. The Navratan Korma had a variety of veggies, cashew and dates added to it. But the gravy was made from melon seeds which were not grinded to the finest. The taste of both the gravies was so so. The rotis were extra thin which meant it turned like papad after a while.  Overall I found this place below average and highly overrated. But liked the fact that they serve a complete vegetarian menu in a village like environment.  The Verdict:  Food/Taste  6/10  Service/Hospitality  6/10  Value for Money  5/10  Ambiance  6/10  Quantity/Quality  6/10  Below average food! Needs to work on their food.                                             rohitdassani.com"
1.0,Very poor service
4.5,Gramin is the perfect place to douse your hunger for a perfect North Indian meal. As the name goes by the place has the ambiance depicting a village. They serve you in the traditional copper utensils which perfectly matches with the aura. The most amazing thing I had there is the Jaljeera which is just too good.
4.5,Amazing place for a nice lunch /dinner. Thali served on weekdays is also amazing. The place is visible from the mainroad . The ambience is also very well maintained. The service is hot and quick.
4.0,Started with bhindi : crispy fried as starters..it was good For family visitation is a very nice place One can get the tummy full n fill and happy to go afterwards for a drowsy peaceful sleep  Taste is good and have a good ambience Total rajasthani look..
4.0,"I went to this restaurant today. The very first time I landed there I ran off seeing the crowd as I was very hungry :p but since I didn't know any area around and the curiosity of knowing what is this fuss about brought me back. so I went and made a reservation and I got shocking results. they told me to wait 20 mins. I would say there were 5 to 8 people in line before me and all they asked was 20 minutes . and yes they kept their words. We were called in and around 20 minutes.  We ordered -  1. mix veg soup  2. handi paneer  3. jeera rice.  4. phulka  So my experience was as follows:-  1. service- it worth noting they were fast. They were feeding at least 50 people at a time but were prompt. wait time was less. they were non-partial so yup don't worry you would be fairly numbered.  2.food- nope, so much of fuss was for nothing. food was normal. mix veg soup was very disappointing. there was very less vegetable to see. I feel even chicken soup has more vegetables than that. The taste wasn't up to mark. jeera rice, I felt quantity was little less. though I saw jeera but failed to find its aroma. handi paneer was in good quantity. phulka was very soft. in fact, the best thing about today's food was phulka.  3.ambience- they have given the touch of a village along with some ornaments of kerela.. :p walls were colored. The furniture looked old and dark colored. plates were heavy and had brass coating while glasses were of brass only. I liked it but it could be made better.  4.price- I saw many have written its cheap and good food. I would agree if you are saying in sense comparative to Bangalore, but if someone from outside Bangalore comes I don't think they would say the same thing. I would say the price was reasonable but not cheap.  Overall, yea its good restaurant. if someone asks me to come there I won't deny but if someone asks me to plan to go there I won't. I feel it is more of one time."
3.5,Nice vegetarian restaurant with wide veriety of food on the menu. Butter milk is quite good. Panner Bharwan Tikka was super tasty and quantity is more than sufficient for two people. However kadai panner was very spicy and few tear drops came out of my eyes . Was not upto my liking. Restaurant doesn't have a parking space which is a big annoyance as place like koramangala is crowded all the time.
3.0,"Was not satisfied with the waiters. Spilt drinks all over me and friend. Food was good, but too spicy. Takes a long time, but worth it... I guess."
2.5,"I have visited this restaurant couple of times. I have had both bad and good experiences. There is no doubt it serves good authentic North Indian food. But there are some dishes you must avoid like Malai Kofta (Koftas were not freshly prepared). Paneer dishes are good. Also I was not at all satisfied with the service. Once we ordered 2 sabjis, out of which they served only one and upon asking for the other sabji, they said that we didn't order and started putting blame on us instead of being sorry and getting that sabji. Also they got naan in place of phulkas. It spoilt our mood that day. So, my rating goes like this - Food - 4/5 Service/Staff- 1/5 Ambience - 3/5 Music - 4/5"
4.0,"An authentic Indian cuisine which includes North Indian food at its best.They have vintage and ethnic ambience with Rajasthani types sofas and pillows as seating.We had ordered a basket of ,lacchha paranthas,tawa rotis and butter kulcha.As a gravy,we had ordered Paneer butter masala.As A part of starters,we had ordered Masala papad and Tomato soup.Service was good.Salt lassi will be so thick here. Service : 3/5 Food : 4.5/5 Ambience : 4/5"
3.0,"An average place to have pocket friendly vegetarian food in koramangala... food is ok, not so amazing even though the hype is too much... tried it multiple times, soups are the thing you shouldn't try there... overall if you just want to have the main course & you are a vegetarian, this place is good..."
3.5,"Gramin, as the name suggests rural area, food was really good here. They have a rural area set up and they  serve food also same.  If you are looking for home like cooked food, then this a good place to visit.   We ordered :- 1) Masala Papad 2) Punjabi Paneer 3) Dal Fry 4) Roti  Punjabi Paneer was really tasty, Dal was OK, Masala Papad was same as usual, rotis were soft and properly cooked.   Overall it was a great experience. Must visit for a general home cooked food and family outing.   Food- 3.5/5 Ambience - 3/5 Service - 3.5/5"
4.0,"Good place for vegetarians. Ambience: There is not much to say about ambience as the place is bit small but has the look and feel of village Food: I like spicy food so ordered Paneer Kolhapuri with double chilly mark. Although it was good but very spicy. So, if you are like medium spicy food go for single chilly or no chilly mark as the food here is normally spicy. Dal fry was good and rotis were crispy. Food was served on brass plates. Service: Quick service with polite people."
5.0,"Pura paisa vasool Lunch.  Here at Gramin,the food, the ambience and the service was just amazing. We ordered Bharwa Tandoori Panner,Allo Babycorn starter,Panner Kolapuri,Roti,Phulke,Lassi and Jaljeera.  What an amazing experience. Soo much of food and of great quality. Truly loved it. I'd recommend the same order for everyone to take. Infact I've also heard the Thaali here is also just yummy. You won't regret coming here. Great Variety too and super friendly staff. Mazaa aagaya! Kudos to the staff!"
2.5,"Expensive for the quality of food they serve. If you cannot serve good Dal and Roti and advertising yourself as Garmin, there is a lot that needs to be done. Roti had flour sprinkled all over it. Reminded me of my college mess. I paid 220 Rs for these two items and was still left unsatiated. Another sad part is that despite so many people in staff, I had to ask water for 2-3 times. Not worth the stars it is honored with."
4.0,"Good please to try vegetarian food here at this joint, located in Kormangala 7th block. This restaurant Will give you a village feel and old 90's songs in the restaurant makes it more perfect.   Pocket friendly Courteous and attentive Staff North Indian veg cooice Beautiful village ambiance  Will visit soon to try more from the menu. Thank you team Gramin  to serve us."
5.0,The best service and food I've had in a while!!! Worth it!!! Couldn't have asked for a better bhindi ki subzi... Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting to have good North Indian food... The best actually...price and food both make u happy!
4.0,"The ambience is the major usp of this place , the food tastes good , best is the nimbu ki shikanj, just can't stop with one , so mouth watering and cost of also decent"
3.5,Food quality was good specially for veggis But service was not good. I went with my friends nice place for veggis. You guys can see pics which I attached.
3.0,Pure veg Restaurant. Food: 3/5 Cost: 3/5 Starters: 2/5 Prefer to have  1. Thali  2 jeera rice and dal 3. Lassi  Note: Do go for soups.. it's worse
5.0,"Awesome food, awesome service. I would prefer everyone to visit here. The preparation is really good and with yummy veg food. Vegetarians should really go for this place."
3.5,Had heard super reviews about this restaurant but got a chance to visit this joint recently only...while the ambience is very good the food lacked taste..all the hype around the place is just a hype and taste lacked. Pocket friendly though but not a place where you want to visit again...
4.0,"This is one of the tasty veg restaurant in kormangala. A place which is set up in a traditional interiors(as per the name 'Gramin'), with copper mug, plates. A heavily crowded place but worth the wait. This is a must visit place for all the vegans out there. Tried roti, subzi, lassi and few starters. The food is tasty and the service is quick hence it maintains the crowd."
2.5,"The place looks popular, a lot of people waiting to get a table. They request you to place order while you are waiting for your seats to expedite the dining.  The food is okay, it is good service that they are unable to offer, probably because of the queue or it was a one off case with my experience. Won't be visiting this place again."
3.5,A nice place to eat some north Indian food. I won't say the food was super tasty or authentic North Indian taste but somewhere close to it. Average ambience but the amount you spend is worth it.
4.5,One of the most popular veggie joint in Koramangala... This place is known for its exquisite food and also for it's service... We were served food in traditional brass utensils which was nice... The food here is awesome whether it be the parathas or veg curries... Always crowded due to it's food and also because of its prices... It's high on value for money... Highly recommended...
3.5,"Pocket friendly North Indian place..  Wide menu, serves the usual north Indian cuisines. True to its name, it is similar to a village environment. The masala chaas is pretty good.   Food:3.5/5 Service:3.5/5 Ambiance:4/5"
3.5,"It was a good place to dine out for vegetarian folks as it's a pure vegetarian place and they have an option to exclude onion and garlic as well from ur food, I would say a master stroke to gather all the jain people. Though I am a jain but I don't discriminate between all the vegetables. So coming back to the taste, it was good but if you are allergic to spicy curries avoid ordering the items which has 2 spices in front of their names in the menu, well they say it's spicy but I would say they put some sort of bhut jolokiya, damn it was hell of a spicy curry and we were literally wiping our tears while having that curry. All in all it was a good experience, I would like to visit again but next time I will order something which will have no spice in front of their name. Thank you for the hospitality and taste."
3.5,"Well, they are popular on weekends, expect alot of waiting and even if you managed to get a table, there might be delay in getting food to your table but yeah their punjabi cuisine food is good in taste Paneer sabjis, kulches will fill ur stomach to satisfaction if waited alot in that line to get inside"
4.0,Went to this place Yesterday with my family.. place is pretty good. Food was nice and very reasonable. It's wonderful feeling when u had so many items and u paid little only.. staff were very polite.  Great  place for family
1.0,"I visited Gramin and the food was not good in taste. Service was way slow and the seating cloth/fabric was dirty and smelly. I didn't found the place worthy.  Cooler - 'Pudina Khhata Meetha' was too sweet in taste and 'Tandoori Roti' were served cold. I have told Gramin staff to replace cold rotis, they took them from table and again served cold rotis. Also, the dal which they served to me, I haven't ordered.  Zero (0) for food taste, One (1) for ambience as seats are very close to other tables, Zero (0) for slow service; though the restaurant was not busy, and Zero (0) for food presentation."
4.0,Authentic delicious veg restaurant that you cannot miss out.  Amazing food and buttermilk is something that you should definitely try.  Weekends gets too crowded but it's worth waiting.   Ambience is very well made with a village look but small enough to accommodate many people.   Service is good and quick and you can order even when your are in wait list.
2.5,Maybe just one of those mad rushing day for gramin and we were caught here on a wrong day on a public holiday.. Had to wait for almost an hour to get inside and trust me when I say they made us wait for half an hour for getting food which was already ordered before we entered inside.. We had ordered masala papad... Which was like any other place.. the roti was really dry and not cooked properly.. The sabji..pujabi panner was not good either.. The gulkand lassi too was too milky n watery unlike lassi.. Worst part was the time we wasted here like 2 hours!! Definitely I caught Gramin on a bad day.. Coz I know they are better than this for which they get such crowds.. But compromising on food for crowd is not done at all
3.5,"We were looking for a place which serves good North Indian food and everyone recommended this restaurant.It was raining heavily in Koramangala and we found haven in this eatery.In drinks, we ordered Aam Panna, Green mint, Shikanji all of these were okayish.We ordered Nawabi Paneer and Dal Afghani in Main course.Nawabi paneer was average and there was nothing great about it. Dal Afghani was the dish of the day and we really enjoyed the spiceness of it.Butter Kulcha, Laccha Parantha, Butter Naan were soft and we enjoyed them as well.Lastly, we catered to our sweet tooth by ordering some Gulab Jamun which was a perfect ending to our meal.  Good place, Good service, Good food :)"
4.0,"Amazing food and an even better ambience. A typical Rajasthani look and warm staff make this restaurant a nice place to dine-out with your family and/or friends. Among the starters, the bhindi Rajasthani is a must have. Other than that, we had ordered a paneer starters and Mirchi ka salan for the main course. Both were quite tasty. A long waiting queue showed how popular this place was. However, the food was worth the wait!"
5.0,"It doesn't feel like eating in a restaurant, but at home. Love the taste. I ordered chana masala, dal fry, masala papad, mix veg soup and two plain rice. It's more than enough for two. Gramin is conveniently close to forum mall."
4.5,Everything is good over here. First off all it is pure veg. Resturant.. All the main course items are just love.. Thandai is amazing.. Ambience is also good Service is good Thank you
3.5,Delicious vegetarian food. Love their roti and naan. Food is spicy and really tasty. I have been here a couple of times and it is worth it. Average price for two: Rs. 700/-
4.0,"The veg Biriyani is a 'must-have'! Awesome food but the long wait & rush is a lil taxing. Space is constrained esp after the long wait but when the good food is served with that nice attitude, it worked out fine in the end."
4.0,"After relocating to Bangalore, me and wife were not aware of good North Indian joints..post reading some reviews on Zomato, we decided to give it a try and Gramin was not at all disappoing..food was very good..rates are very reasonable, they serve hot piping fulkas...do expect waiting for 20-30 mins..Do try their aloo tikka and shikhanji..."
3.0,Food is here is okay.. I won't say great. The place is to small you almost would bump into a waiter carrying food. Ambiance is good and specially the cutlery used.. Loved them. However there are way to many mosquitoes.
4.5,"Dropped in for lunch on a weekday so seating was not an issue. The place has got this rustic charm to it. Service was good. Coming to the food, it was brilliant. This is coming from someone who usually loves her non veg cuisines. The flavours were great and the food was spicy, just as we had requested"
3.5,Usually crowded on weekends. Very small compact place but very utilzed. Located in Raheja arcade kormangla. We checked into this place by looking at the reviews. One thing to mention abt this place is staffs are very courteous. Food wasn't that great. Overall a one time visit place
1.0,"Very bad food.  I think it's one is the worst restaurant in bangalore that I have been to. We went on a Sunday,  it was over crowded,  we had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table.  The food served was pathetic.  Do not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
5.0,"Was a great experience, we went on a late Saturday afternoon- waiting was about 15 mins and you could place your order before itself so that it would be served as soon as one enters.  The decor is very village-like, true to their name. We ordered veg thali, lassi, jaljeera. Veg thali had choice of tandoori/ tawa roti, babycorn aloo, butter paneer masala, dal makhani, raita, salad, gulab jamun and pulav   Lassi was good, perfect amount of sweet  and jaljeera was masala- filled, loved both   Everything tastes well, staff was courteous and service was on time  And the best part, it was really economical too"
4.5,My favourite place to binge eat North Indian food. It's a vegetarian place which makes it a complete win win for me. Absolutely love their varieties of Paneer and Dal Makhni is superb. I like their breads too but once I got disappointed when I ordered a bread basket and most of the rotis were soggy or undercooked.  Other than that it's a place I go to when I can't decide where to grab a meal.
4.0,"Had been here on a friend's treat. The restaurant had a long queue on Sunday so we had to wait around 45mins. Coming to the good we had ordered roti bucket  which and multiples varieties, Aam panna, jaljeera drinks, sarso Ka sang, paneer handi, sarso Ka saag, paneer do pyaza, methi malai matar. Out of all of them Sarso Ka saag and paneer handi were bang on. Loved the food, they took the order before we entered so we didn't wait after entering, the staff were good, co-operative. So had a great experience. Food-4.5 Service-4 Ambience-4.5 Price-4 So overall 4.5"
2.5,Long que on a sunday evening...but the wait was not at all worth....food was not that good for the price I paid and the time waited....the service was decent and my rating is for that....
5.0,"Being a vegetarian I was really looking forward to visit this restaurant. The place is perfect anyone looking for tasty spicy food, nice ambience, super fast courteous service and budget friendly. Also there is a pan wala at the entrance of rahena arcade which you must try after food."
4.5,"This was one of the restaurant which I wanted to go from such a long time but couldn't go as it was very far from the place I lived. One Saturday finally made up my mind and thought of exploring the options that is available in this restaurant as I had heard alot about this place. And to be very frank I was taken aback by the crowd who were waiting for their turn to have their table. It is a small , well maintained ,nicely decorated place which is not a big hole on anyone's pocket for sure. Ambience -4.5/5 Price -4.5/5 Taste -4.5/5"
4.5,"Its the best restaurant in Bangalore, yes the best. Not much vegeterian restaurants with the best North Indian food are there in this city, But Gramin is different. Been to this restaurant like 15 times in my 1 year of living in Bangalore. Location is superb. Forum Mall Kormangala side. Artificial rural ambience. My favourite choice here is always Panner Kadhai with Tawa Roti. All other gravies are equally great. Pricing is okay, and staff behaviour is also good."
4.0,It is a haven of sorts for vegetarians.  This is one of the few restaurants that serve their veg starters and gravy spicy and not sweet. Do not miss ordering Gramin's gulkhand milk shake!
4.5,"Food is beyond the words. This restaurant is pure veg and you will get the taste of North Indian food deliciously. Regarding cost, it's upto you how much you order.

2.5,"A lovely ambiance that is quite different from the usual fare, Gramin stands true to its words with an authentically done set-up. It has a charming rustic feel to it thanks to its decor.  Unfortunately, for lack of an appetite, we weren't able to eat anything here, having chosen to come here as a waiting place for a friend. However, I ordered a drink of lime juice, and quite shockingly, it is the worst ever lime juice I've tasted. It was too sweet and salty and they had added some inexplicable flavour. I couldn't swallow more than a couple of sips as it made me feel queasy."
4.5,Seating is nice. Had tawa corn peas with chutney. Paneer butter masala and Naan. Food was really tasty. And quantity was enough for us. We were three people. We had to wait for 10mins but that was okay. This place is a must visit for some good veg food. Service is fast. They took our order while we were waiting outside and as soon as we were seated food was served. Nice service. Nice decor.
2.0,"Late revjew. Been here last month. One of the over hyped restaurants in Bangalore.  We ordered: Lehsuni Paneer Paneer Handi Dal Makhni Boondi Raitha Kulcha Roti Lassi Lime soda  Food experience:  - There's nothing special about lehsuni except the name. It was just another dish from any roadside eatery - Boondi Raitha, Dal Makhni, Lassi, Lime Soda : No restaurant can prepare this bad. Not at least simple dishes like these. But the ones I had here were pathetic. Had to leave each of this without even finishing half the serving. - Paneer Handi : This was okayish. I would rate 3/5. But if you're experienced with authentic paneer dishes you wouldn't like this as well - kulcha was good but roti was equally bad.  Hospitality: - The first impression was good as order was taken before our seat allotment. However, that doesn't make difference because they started to make my order only when I got seat. Hence, waiting time was 45 mins. - We were served starters and again waited for 20 mins. For main course. Upon asking waiter, he says "" we served you one dish, you'll have to wait"" - The waiters were clumsy with no experience in managing table, they weren't even able to arrange dishes properly - There was no place to keep water mug on table so we had to call waiter everytime for a glass of water.  If you're a foodie with good taste for North Indian food then this is NOT the place for you."
4.5,Went here on a weekend for brunch and had thali. Food was good but a bit spicy. Highly recommended place to have good pure vegetarian food in a cozy ambience.
4.0,"Its a good place for vegetarians. They provide a good North Indian food, especially a rajastani style. Some one who has a strong spicy taste buds, go visit! They really have a good number of items for that. The taste of the food is good. Ambience is fine."
4.0,Pulkas and rose milk both are too gud  Ambiance is too gud  Retro music Serving as Village custom Neatly maintained without any issues Complete Village experience
4.5,"If you are a vegetarian and you crave for some authentic North-Indianfood, this is the right place for you guys! Thali is really tasty and pocket-friendly :pOverall - 4.5/5 Taste - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Service - 4/5  Will be going back to try some more varieties :)"
2.5,Well the ambience is okay. Food isnt that good. We ordered dal makhani. They forgot to add makhan in it. Later they got it which was just okay. Lasooni paneer was good. Service isnt that good. A below average experience.
4.5,"Keeping aside the location of this restraunt, everything about it was great. Good staff, perfect gramin ambience and great food. Since we were looking for Jain food, the staff made sure that we are served with all the dishes without onion and garlic. The green chilli soda was something I tried here for the first time and really liked it. Would love to visit this place again."
5.0,Very Good ambience. Also hospitality is also very good. Test of the food is also very good.  Response from the service is also veri nice. Once everyone should go for this restaurant.
4.5,"Very good place to spend nice evening but in weekends Eve may you have to wait 20-30 Minutes for seat. For veg Dinner Gramin is primary option for me and I liked their interior, Service and drinks(Lassi, Jalzeera, Buttermilk) post food."
4.5,I am a die hard non vegetarian but if vegetarian food can taste so good I would happily convert to being a veggie.... Stuffed kulchas completely worth the money.
5.0,"Amazing quality food with traditional authentic ambience. Good place to eat, variety of food and must visit place.  Food: 5/5 Ambience:4.5/5 Variety of food:4.7/5 Price:4/5 Highly recommended: 4.5/5  I recommend everyone to visit this restaurant once to reach authentic ambience and the food"
4.0,"This place is located inside raheja complex near forum mall, Koramangala.  The decor of the place is that of a village(True to its name) and they play old 80-90s song. Went on a weekend to this place. Heavily crowded it is during peak hours. So time your visit accordingly. This place is strictly 100% vegetarian. Also, jain friendly food on request is available. This place is famous for their lunch thalis don't give that a miss. Also,thandai and panna they serve is great. Service is also very fast. Given the ambiance, service and food, the place is very cheap."
3.0,"There always a long queue of people here waiting outside to have food. Though, Food is not that much delicious that people have to wait here for around 30 minutes. There paneer dishes are fine, dal Makhani is very bad, Sweet Lassi is Good.  Visited on 9th July 2017."
4.5,"Pocket Friendly!!Finger licking Vegetarian Food!! Amazing Ambience Bhindi Kurkure ,and Babycorn Fry ,were the scrumptious starters we ordered.  Main Course -if you are in a  huge group,I suggest you order roti ki tokri!! This place is a must try if you want good food, a place  which weighs less on your pocket!!"
1.5,Taste is not good .it not worth as per piece.too many options but didn't like anything.and also services need to improve staff is doing hurry for everything
3.0,"Service was good, but the quality of the food is something which let's this place down, especially the Anjeer Shake. Behavior of the waiter was also not polite."
4.0,"I came to know about this place after a silly google search be like ""Poha near me"" and this was the first place that came up in the suggestions.   Basically i always keep my expectations low whenever I'm trying out an other state dish. And after visiting this place I'm happy that this didn't let me down :P  First of all as soon as you enter, this place welcomes you with a beautiful decor , perfect lighting and a broad staircase for the first floor dining. The name totally justifies the ambience.  I ordered Aloo Poha , samosa and Masala buttermilk ( which became my personal favorite) because they serve only snacks during 3 pm to 7pm. So incase you're planning to go for lunch or dinner make sure you visit it at the right time.  The prices of the north indian dishes and the thali seems so reasonable and it's worth a shot. I totally recommend you to visit this place with your family :)   P.s : They also have one big table where 10-12 people could easily dine out at the same time."
5.0,"Full marks. Wonderful experience. We went there a little after 12:30 PM and it was almost empty but in no time it got filled. Their food is awesome. Must try is the malai kofta and masala papad! Nice ambiance, super service"
3.5,"Nice ambience. Good place for Jain food. We ordered paneer handi, the gravy was a bit sour. Navratna korma was good, had very less gravy though. Daal fry and rice were the best. Rotis were also very soft and nice. Overall a good place to visit."
4.0,"A fair place which does justice to the money you spend for food here.  First some information: #Serves only Veg. #A Family place.  #Rajasthani Decore, pretty decent and not overdone.  #Gentle staff.  About the Food: I have tried almost all dishes here :) going there from 4 5 years now.  SOME POSITIVES: #Good Tasty Food: The Best part is, it is not too spicy. #Good Variety of Dishes: Well, mostly where ever you go in Bangalore in Dishes you will find PANEER ..PANEER and More PANEER.. Well this place tries to delight you with better main course options which are equally good in taste too.  #DRY FRIED BHINDI NOT TO BE MISSED: It is sort of a starter light and healthy. Must try.  # Masala Papad and Masala Chach served here make a perfect combo of a good veg starter as well.   SOME NEGATIVES: Not many negatives, but to nitpick a few are as under: #Too long waiting for weekends.. but it is the same everywhere in Bangalore ;)  #Menu is too old now, They should introduce some new dishes.  #They should certainly come up with things like coal or wood fire Nans and Rotis..  In short, Value for Money Place !!   Reservations Recommended."
4.5,"Well well well how often do we meat eaters agree to go for a pure Vegetarian meal?...I would say.....hardly??? Lol!  But seriously you guys...for once, Gramin will make you not regret a vegetarian meal. Their food is so flavourful that you will savour every bite. I would suggest trying their Thali which comes with a choice of phulka/nan, jeera rice, two assorted sabzis and gulab jamun to end your lovely meal with. During the mango season you must not miss their Aam panna and if its not available then Nimbu ka shikanji is no less to cool you down in the hot weather. Their decor takes you back to a simple rural traditional Indian home and you might end up visiting this place more than once."
4.0,"Been there many times since last few years, one of the best places for tasty vegetarian food in Bangalore and variety of pure desi dishes is amazing. Pudina sharbat is a must try here! Must visit place if you are in Bangalore and looking for desi and tasty veg food :)"
3.5,"I went there many times between 2011-2014. It's a small cozy place with very village like ambience. Food was good too. I loved their buttermilk, baigan bharta, missi roti. In 2014, I took a large group to celebrate my wife's birthday, and the food was a bit of disappointment that time. Not sure why but they couldn't live up to the expectations. Since then I haven't gone back. Will give it a try once more this year and I hope it doesn't fail me."
4.5,"Simple and delicious. That's how I would describe my meal at Gramin. Visited the restaurant last Wednesday for dinner.  First of, the location is quite convenient as it is walkable from Forum Mall. The setting is rustic with a attempt to make you feel like you are in a dhaba. What I did not like was the music being played - some random 80s Bollywood songs that we had never heard and which i am sure mustn't have been popular even then :p  Coming to the food - they only serve veg here; but I feel the hard core non-vegetarians should not miss out on this one.  In starters we ordered lasuni paneer dhuendaar, which is essentially garlicky spicy paneer. There were 6 large chunks of paneer which was enough for the four of us to along with some masala papad (with was just ok). We also ordered chaas and masala soda, which were very refreshing.  In main course, we ordered bhindi masala, dal Afghani, basket of assorted rotis (just enough for 4) and jeera rice. The dal was fantastic and went well with the rice.   I must mention that our waiter was extremely helpful with the menu, suggesting us the most popular dishes as well as ensuring that we did not overorder. Big thumbs up for that. I have been to places where they have unnecessarily made us waste so much food and money. He suggested that we also order peas corn masala but since we were in the mood for some paneer, we gave it a skip. He also took the effort to socialize with us.  Probably the only downside is the choice of desserts. They only had gulab jamun available that day. Not sure if it was a Wednesday evening issue. I have heard from friends that this place super packed on the weekends (the number of chair outside are a clear indication of the rush). So plan to come early.  I almost forgot to mention the prices. All of this came for about 1500 bucks, wich I feel was totally worth it!   Overall my ratings- Food- 4.5 Service- 4.5 Ambience- 3 (-.5 for the lame 80s music :p) Value for money- 4.5"
4.5,"A cozily relaxed evening munching and chatting, with my cousins Kishan, Gita and Gauri at Gramin restaurant in Bangalore's Koramangala neighborhood.  The place still looks a bit over-deliberately faux rustic; years after it hatched in Bangalore, it's still doing well--not a table empty, and a short waiting line outside. They've also expanded the interior, by acquiring the store next door.  Gramin is arguably one of the better all vegetarian North Indian restaurants in Bangalore.   I started with a delectable sweet corn soup, with plumply tasty nuggets of corn bobbing on the surface.   Then, a great appetite stimulant: nimbu ki shikanji, a drink that cut the peppery cumin taste of jal jeera with lemon and sugar. We shared the hors d'oeuvres: platters of bhindi Rajasthani (crisp, fresh fried okra, lightly spiced), and corn and peas.   Followed by the main course: light flat wheat bread (tawa rotis), aloo paratha, a delicious dal tadka (yellow lentils), with aloo gobhi (potato and cauliflower), and kofta curries.   Accompanying condiments: mint chutney (pudina), raita, salad, raw onions, green chillies and ever so fresh young lemons.   Dessert? Gulab jamuns.  The conversation punctuated by humor, was wide-ranging--from the chakra system in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology to holistic approaches to ageing and dis-ease.   We enjoyed ourselves hugely, and didn't want the evening to end.  I look really well fed and ready to enter Nirvana in Pic #3.  --Raj Ayyar"
4.5,"Went there for Saturday lunch, the place was super crowded with long waiting queue, so book a table prior to coming.  This rustic Indian restaurant is a perfect place if you are craving for North Indian food in Bangalore. For starters we had Aloo Chutki and Babycorn Masaledar. Both of them were good. For main course we had kandhari Aloo, Achaari Panner, pudina Paratha, lachcha Paratha and jal jeera. Kandhari Aloo was okayish but everything else totally made-up for it. Overall a good place for North Indian food with relatively cheaper price."
5.0,A very nice place where we get rajasthani food. The ambiance is very well maintained. The restaurant uses copper vessels. The food quality and taste is amazing.
5.0,"Their food and so amazing and so value for money, that if you do once, you'd definitely crave for more. It's near to the forum mall.  Must try: chilly garlic roti, kaju-corn curry, lemon mint juice"
4.0,"One of the good place to taste north indian food, The food is good and the ambiance also.  gulab jamoon tastes great. Food : 3.5/5  Ambiance : 3.5/5  Service : 4/5"
2.5,"Generally I avoid having veg by paying in a restro but this time it was an invitation. Unaware of everything we went and to my surprise I found that the rating was good on Zomato and it's also over crowded. I felt that this one won't dissapoint me. After waiting for about good half an hour we got out places . The ambiance is average,low lit up ,they have a 2 floor seating arrangement. After going through a huge lists of menu we ordered for Veg Kolhapuri , Veg Paneer and Gramin Kofta with nun and fulkas . Both Kolhapuri and Paneer dishes were too spicy letting us nothing to taste properly and the Kofta were still ok . Food got wasted and I hate that part .  Wish I had never visited."
4.0,"Despite bad experience last time,decided to give a second try.This time food was tasty and staff was cordial.Ordered paneer tikka masala...which was little dry and very less gravy but good taste.Along with it ordered sabji ka salan and this dish I tried first time and liked a lot.Naan was burnt and masala papad tomatos were chopped at 4pm and served at 9pm kinda taste.Overall ok experience but still there is huge scope for improvement by look at their menu.Ambiance and music they play is much better than their food."
4.0,"Great ambiance, good service, good quantity of food very filling and worth the money. Staff very helpful. Loved the sweet Lassi try it! a great Traditional (gramin) village sort experience good for family luncheons and dinners."
3.5,liked the ambiance and the copper clad utensils...food was okayish nothing great about it...the seating space was cramped though....and it's economical too amidst all the great and expensive restaurants in the vicinity.
4.5,Life Saver for North Indians ... Was totally screwd after coming to Bengalore... Thank you team #Gramin for serving those chapatis... Took me to my home... They are amazing with their Chaach...  Enjoyed my visit a lot... Keep it up
1.0,Very bad behavior of the staff. At the entrance itself the guy asks what do you want. And even he was very reluctant give an entry for me. This very bad and do not want to visit this place ever again.
4.0,A good place to have north indian cuisines. Lassi and jaljeera are yummy as well.   We ordered paneer gravies along with lacchha parathas and kulchas and hada good time here.
3.5,The best place if you're almost broke and yet you feel like treating yourself with some good food.  I'm a regular to Gramin and they've never failed to impress.   This place is right behind forum and is very convenient for those visiting the mall.   Don't ever plan to go for a light meal to this place. You'd end up having the heaviest three course meal you've ever had.   Would certainly visit again.   Cheers!  #fortheloveoffood
3.0,"Decent food. Place has a typical Rajasthani decor. Tried a thali for lunch. Good quantity, taste was ok. Service was quick. A one time go place."
4.0,"If you are a vegetarian, you cannot stay in Bangalore for a longer time without visiting this place. The fixed thaali is worth the money. The place is crowded on weekends so do expect a bit of waiting. The ambience is fantastic. The service is okayish. Have been here multiple times. Sometimes the service is great, but not all the times. Must come here for lunch once, worth the money!"
4.0,"A good restaurant to go for budget friendly, but delicious vegetarian food. The ambience is very good as well. P.S they have no parking space available."
3.5,"Dinner at Gramin was an enjoyable one. The place is quite crowded even on a weekday. The decor is done up just like a village house in North India. Liked their menu card design. Had Buttermilk - non spicy, Gramin Biryani, Jeera Rice and Punjabi sabji. Some of the items are a little too hot and spicy so check it out before ordering. Dessert was gulab jamun. Overall it's a good place for all those who love North Indian veg food. Service is pretty fast and the place is neat."
4.0,"Rustic rural ambience , very basic furniture and decor.  The food and price make up for lack of grandeur.  The tawa paneer and baby corn dish was below avg. Stuffed potato from Tandoor section was good. Recommend that if you like the smokey, charred flavours.  For mains we went with phuklas and Gramin Kofta. They claim it to be spicy but they add raisins to the Kofta.  Overall decent food and great value for money.  The thali seemed to be a good pick for those watching their budget."
5.0,"A perfect combination of delicious food, great ambience and a really awesome service.... Paneer bhurji was very good....The food was fantastic..And above all the service was extremely warm and welcoming.....It's a must visit!!!"
2.0,The food is not so good specially fhulka and gramin kofte. The food is not good as compare to the exterior and interior of the place. Please improve the quality of food
4.5,Small and cozy place. Authentic North Indian food is been served. Ambience is just like a hut in a village.  Serving is quite good and the food tastes amazing. The thali here was the best! A good place to hangout for lunch with friends or family.
3.5,"Noticed this restaurant many times,even heard from many people its pretty good.Since this restaurant is always crowded due to which never went inside to have food.This time decided to go here and see whats good about it. Waited in queue for 30 mins and finally got a table, since while waiting in queue we ordered so it took less time and food reached our table in 10 mins. First thing which we had was masala papad which was just ok. In main course we had paneer tikka masala, lachha paratha, butter kulcha and butter naan. Price wise felt its not less and not too much, taste wise food was average. Service was pretty good.After coming out was not able get why this restaurant is always crowded as food was just average. Next time i wont go and have food here if need to wait for more than 15 mins in queue, within this time i can reach more better restaurant which i know."
4.0,Nice place for vegetarians in Bangalore. Been there 5-6 times and it was always good. Pudina khatta meetha is recommended. Overall good Rajasthani restaurant.
5.0,"Super experience every time I visit this place. Beautiful food. Amazing ambience, service, even the cutlery feels royal. Probably one of the best North Indian restaurants in the city."
5.0,Gramin was suggested by a friend and I loved the place. I should thank my friend for suggesting.. The place is lovely and the food is amazing.. Good staff and good service.
1.0,"I have enjoyed Gramin since 2003 however my last 3 experience have been horrible. The food had multiple hairs and the quality was below par, rather than making my grievances public, I preferred to address it to management however management was more about show off of wealth and behaved very impolitely while he had the audacity to state that when the food is made in large quantity, hairs and things like that are very common. I chose not to argue and walked way with extremely bad experience."
4.0,"Good vegetarian food.. Nice interiors as the name is.. Good and quick service.. We had panner haryali, kaju masala and naan.. Which was yummy..moderate pricing"
5.0,There are no amount words which i can put here which shows the amount of happiness at gramin. Food is good completely vegetarian. You can ask them to remove onion and garlic. Food is served hot and is filling. Nothing overpowering. Lassi is cool and pleseant. Cute little place which reminds you of how it was.
4.0,"A pocket friendly restaurant with good number of options on food for a vegetarian is Gramin. Seating, ambience, quality and the taste of the food were satisfactory"
4.0,Good ambience. Place is done up like a hut in a village. Furnitures are traditional north Indian village style. Food is pretty good and authentic north-indian style. There are many options to choose from and its tasty.
4.5,This restaurant has the best North Indian thali...  Worth its price...  Also has a very good ambience.... And their Sweet Lassi is a must try!
4.5,Amazing place. Simple north Indian food. Good service. Great ambience.  My constant from their menu is the pineapple raita and the masala chaanch! :)
1.5,A small place which appears to be overcrowded since there is no waiting area. You are made to sit outside in the corridor where your orders are taken. As soon as you get your turn to get a seat(I. E approximately 15 to 20 min even with a reservation) you are served with cold  already prepared food that tastes very average. No choice of desert since it's only jamoon here. A single star is also not good enough but I have given 2stars for the waiters spoke in   kannada
4.5,I have never seen such a long list of vegetarian main course in Bangalore. And it was equally justified with huge crowd outside the restaurant on Sunday afternoon... They give you menu outside to decide so you don't take time inside. I don't think anyone can be disappointed after eating here. And as you can see price are very reasonable
4.5,"Superb food. Authentic north indian desi style food. Lovely ambience , great taste and quality, decent pricing. Sumptuous finger licking food."
4.0,"Gramin is a nice n pocket friendly eatery. We ordered chatka gobhi for starters, palak kofta n navratna korma with butter naan n butter kulcha. Food- 4/5 Service- 5/5 Ambience- 3.5/5 (can be made more bright) Cost- 5/5 Special mention- there pudina/ dhania chutney is awesome. Best I had till now in Bangalore. Precisely flavoured. Must visit."
5.0,"Best place for pure vegetarians.. Food quality is too good, staff is friendly. One thing is that, the place is very small, very few tables are there. On weekends you've to wait for some time."
3.5,"The ambience is like Indian village. The utensils, furniture etc.  Pure veg people may like this place. They sometimes take ages to make the order ready. Jaljeera is a must have. Taste can be improved lot."
3.0,"Liked the food in first visit then visited again with my friends after 4-5 months but this time food was not at all good it was tasteless. Ordered - bhindi Rajasthani , daal makhani , kadai paneer , stuffed kulcha , butter naan , missi roti Jaljeera and rose lassi - must try"
4.0,One of the good veg restaurants in Koramangala. Nice ambience and good staff. Nice food and starters and quantity is good as compared to the price. Definitely try for pure Veggies.
4.0,"I visited this place after one friend recommended it . ordered lahsooni paneer dhuedar, gramin kofta, firki paratha and pudina khatta meetha along wid mandatory dessert.( Marwari meal is incomplete without dessert) food was delicious. Will visit again definitely....:)"
3.5,There has always been a lot of crowd at this place and the waiting-list always stopped me from going to this place. I was really excited to eat here. The ambiance and the service was okay. I had North Indian food. The Navratna Korma was the best dish I had here. The Kadai Paneer was really below average. They serve the food in Copper look-a-like utensils which is interesting. The Lassi was good but costly. The prices for the North Indian food is on the higher side at this place. I will eat the famous thali here and I would update my review soon.
4.0,"A very good place to have north India type Veg Food. They are famous for their Special Thali and really worth trying. We got one Veg soup, one Paneer plater and two meals. Everything was just yumm. Plater Paneer was bit spicy though. Meals is nicely arranged with Rice, roti, two sabjis, sweet, raita, papad, pickle etc. Every item from the Thali was nicely cooked and tasty. A must try guys. If you are going on weekends better to drop in early afternoon or book a table before."
4.0,"#Sarso da saag, makke Di Roti.... Awesome. I think people must try this.  5* 1. Kadai paneer is testy. 4* 2. Tandoori Butter roti (wheat) 4* 3. Daal with ghee tadka is ok.. 2.5* 4. Kesar Lassi.... 3.5* 5. Bhindi Rajsthani.... 5* 6. Service - There is delay between foods. 3.5* 7. Environment with old songs... 4.5* 8. Pocket friendly... 4.5*"
4.5,This place offers the authentic North Indian flavours. We ordered Hara bhara kebab in starters - very yummy.. Veg kolhapuri is a must - if u like spicy food. Add lassi to it and u r done for the day..  The ambiance makes it even more special and being located in the heart of kormangala is a cheery on cake.  Only thing the staff can work on - may be increase the quantity of veggies..
2.0,"Very spicy food, especially if you are ordering a thali. Have a good spread but should work on the oil levels and spice content, else it will remain just about an average place. Also the behavioral of staff should be worked upon. Bit of arrogance in almost all of my experiences."
4.0,It is a very good place for north indian food with great village theme. Not a very expensive place with decent prices. It gets crowded over the weekend after 8  with waiting so I would suggest that you go a little early if you can to avoid the rush.
4.5,"Superb place for vegetarians. Food is really good with plenty of options to pick from. It was way beyond our expectation. Best part is it's very pocket friendly. Next time I want to have veg food, I'll straightaway head to this place."
4.0,One among the best place I have visited for a simple vegetarian home like food. I had been here countless times especially when we were missing Ghar ka khana. The ambiance is simple the way it's served is hygiene and the cost is pocket friendly as well.  The taste of the food will remind you of your home and everything is good and it's worth giving a try to it.
5.0,"Best place for North Indian Vegetarian Food.. From past few days they are serving snacks like Samosa, Chole Bhature, Parathas between 3:30 pm to 7pm Kurkure Bhindi, Lahsuni Paneer, Lassi, and many more......."
3.5,"A pure vegetarian restaurant specialising in North Indian cuisine, this place is located inside a building complex. The 'From The Village' themed restaurant has every nook and corner the look of a house that you could find in the villlages. The palm leaves, bamboo, wood and brick interiors can be a witness to that. The two floor restaurant was quite full for a saturday afternoon lunch even post 2:30p.m. Luckily with a short waiting time we get a table in the first floor. After seated we look around to find the place to be decorated with copper vessels and wooden figurines.  The menu card on a palm leaves knitted board has even few dishes which can be chosen to be cooked without onion and garlic. That is a first that I have seen. We order a Babycorn Paneer Allahabadi, Gobi Masala, Butter Roti and Buttermilk.  The Buttermilk arrives first in a very different kind of glass. The buttermilk was chilled and blended well. The Babycorn Paneer Allahabadi arrives next. It is a spicy dish with babycorn, paneer, peas, corn, tomato, green chillies and cooked in a flavourful and spicy masala. Dishes of lemons, pickle and mint chutney was served too.  The roti and Gobi Masala arrives next. The Gobi Masala comprising of gobi and peas has a sweet flavour to it. The Butter Roti was light and the combo of the roti with the gobi was delicious.  The ambience and food was very good. The negative was the staff hurrying us off as it was closing time. That was a bit disappointing because we took it to be rude."
3.0,"Well this was my 2nd visit after 5 long years and I still remember how impressed I was earlier. This time, it was just ok. So we ordered Kadhi with Kofta and Dal Makhani for the gravies and one boiled rice, two ghee phulkas and one butter Naan. Kadhi was too good, the kind I like, sour and spicy. But, frankly other items were not as good as I thought would we. Dal Makhani was full of garlic, rice was of sub standard quality, phulkas were barely touched with ghee and were not even hot and butter Naan was also dry. Ambience of the restaurant is fine and service can be faster. Regarding bill, it was some 525 bucks for two for above mentioned items which is alright. Sectionwise Rating :  Food: 3 Ambience: 3 Service : 3 Value for Money : 3"
3.0,Ambience 3.5/5 Taste 3/5 Service 3.5  Had been there on a Sunday and could get a place for Five. Except for Lassi and Babycorn nothing tested good. Parathas were the worst choice we made.
4.5,Very well managed. Even on weekends when they have huge rush they properly manage the wait list and their pre orders. Food is for sure simple and awesome.
3.0,Gramin is a place known for good food. However we had visited recently and food was really bad. The daal makhni was a disaster. The daal was tasting sweet and had kishmish in it...!!!  The paneer butter masala was also equally bad. The gravy was not palatable. Even the butter tadoori roti was bad.  Only good thing was the starter dish babycorn paneer hyderabadi masala and the lassi.  Please improve the quality of your food and the service as well asap.  Ambience : 4/5 Food : 2.5/5 service : 3/5
2.5,"Visited this place on a Saturday afternoon. Ambience is very average Food is average  Mediocre service. If you are staying far from this pace, not worth the trip."
4.0,"Been here for a quick bite today afternoon on my way home. Had masala papad, lasooni paneer , jaljeera, kulcha and veg handi.  Masala papad was just ok. The chutney served with the lasooni paneer was a bit spicy but complimented the bland paneer really well. The butter kulcha was a let down with rubbery feel. But the veg handi made up for that with its good taste. The star of the show was definitely the jaljeera. Goes with anything at anytime in this place.  The taste has improved a lot from the earlier visit a year ago. Service could do with a bit faster turnaround. The restaurant was half full when we landed but still had to wait fir the next dish."
1.0,Not satisfying .... It's only a hype created by public ... Pathetic dal fry with ajwain n  curry leaves ... Completely opposite taste ... Ketchup type veg curry sweet in taste ... Poor helpless staff ... Pls Dnt visit looking at the ratings
5.0,"I have to write this review as soon as possible - owe it to good food over here . We ordered sweet corn soup, sweet lassi, gramin kofta, ghee phulke, jeera rice, dal fry - everything to last bite was fabulous. The staff is courteous and though there is always waiting over here at this place this is effective managed. Considering Bengaluru the place is inexpensive too. Real gold for people craving for good northern food at affordable prices. Special ambience of gramin decor with 90s song in background one is sure to have good time at this place."
4.0,This place gets so crowded you have to wait in a queue for seating. Lovely cozy ambience and love the copperware in use.  The food is just gharwala feel and sooo yum.  We tried the dahiwali bhindi and the khatta meetha baingan. Very good quantity.We had to bag the leftovers after consuming for 2 ppl. The gheewale phulka you can just keep having more of. The nimbu shikanji was yum.  This place is on my list for homely north indian food
4.0,"Nice interiors as it goes well with and compliments the name given to the eatery. Had veg thaali there and the quantity of the thali was just apt for a person. Service is ok, ambience is a plus, taste is awesome.  Good job Gramin!! Just a suggestion if you can keep the contents of the thali on rotation basis...it would become interesting."
4.5,Gramin is a really nice place in Bangalore for vegetarians.. I love the ambiance and food is incredible. Been here multiple times with family and friends and always had a great time. Recommended.
3.5,"Gramin is known for its ambience and the economical food. Me and my friends wanted to visit this place from a long time. We were welcomed really well. The service was little slow, and the food wasnt great too. Need lots of improvemens interms of taste.  Ambience: 4/5 Service : 4/5 Food :3/5"
4.5,"I went to this place after starving throughout the day thanks to some work.When I reached people were already waiting outside the restuarant. We were told a ten minutes wait time. We decided to wait and the wait time was used duly to decide the menu and place the order. Unlike other places, the wait ended well within ten minutes and we found ourselves seated in this dimlit awesome looking place.  The food was served on copper/copper plated vessels. Here was one interesting experience that we felt good about - Thanks to the mad hunger we probably were too generous with our orders. The staff who was taking our orders advised that we should first order a few items and if we were still hungry after having them, then we could place the other orders. And he said it in the nicest way that we agreed willingly and ordered less. And guess what, we were full and didn't need the extra food. Now that I think is value added service.. Coming to the food, the Garlic Panneer on the starters and the Punjabi veg curry was good, the butter chilli roti can be skipped, the peas pulao was more briyanish nevertheless tasty, but the phulkari with ghee was delicious. What I loved about this place was that everything was clean and fresh including the onions and lemons. Overall it was a satiating dinner and a very warm experience."
3.0,"Sometimes back visited this place, the ambience of the place is not so great and it's mostly over crowded on weekends, so one can expect to wait a while to get a table, while u wait, u can check out the menu and even place the order before getting a table, so once u get the seat you can start within no time.  We order- Tomato Soup, Masala Papad and Kurkuri Bhindi in starters, coming to the taste, soup tastes average, Kurkuri Bhindi could be better if they add some more spices not a great choice starter in my opinion, Masala papad didn't have coriander leaves, no garam masala sprinkled, just chopped tomatoes and onions.  Coming to the main course- We ordered Kaju Masala, Dal Tadka Handi, and Basket of Roties, and Jeera Rice. Kaju Masala- Gravy of the dish tasted good but kaju's were over cooked so it Spoilt the taste. Dal Tadka Handi was really nice, tasted great with proper masale and tadka on top. Basket of Roties contain 4 types on Roties I forgot the name, it was crowded so were not cooked properly and they won't be having any butter on top, so butter lovers should order the roti choices separately, Jeera Rice was nice.  Service is Good, Taste can be improved by not serving fastly prepared dishes, a customer won't mind a extra 5-10 mins if food taste better than presentation on the dish."
5.0,"Im not a person who eats veg as I find it very boring but this place changed the way I think about veg food. Its a wonderful place which serves yummy veg food and offers an amazing ambiance. If Ur planning to go on a weekend be prepared to Wait in a Q before you get a table, but it's worth the wait."
2.5,"Service: During waiting time only they take your food order so when you get your table, your food arrives immediately.   Food: We have visited this place last in 2012 and we did not liked the food which they served to us. We have ordered 1 paneer gravy, 1 dal fry, hara Bhara kebab and rice. Out of which only Harabhara kebab were ok rest all ----."
4.5,"An excellent option for all you vegetarians! Absolutely loved everything about this place  the ambiance, the food, the pricing, everything.  On a crowded Saturday afternoon, we reached here hoping some good lunch. We weren't let down. The owner of the place was walking around taking orders, that's the kind of involvement from the management that you see in great places.  Let me break down the experience. (i) the ambiance was nice, nothing out and out fancy, but with its own charm (ii) the food was simply superb  shout outs to the owner recommended tawa karela (with an option to not pay for it if we didn't like it, and boy, we loved it) and the khatta-meetha baingan; the rotis were amazing (nice, generous stuffing within the paranthas) and of course my personal favorite of the day, lahsuni paneer (an absolute must try, for the great flavors alone!) and (iii) the pricing being extremely in the affordable range. It was about 1300 for the four of us, two starters, two sabzis, four rotis, side drinks and desserts  and we ate enough to ensure that we skipped dinner 8 hours later.  :)  All in all, this is a place that you shouldn't miss. Totally worth a detour.  P.S.: I am vegetarian too!"
3.5,"Whether or not you love to gorge on vegetarian delicacies, make sure you drop in here at least once while you are in Koramangala. Try the thali, and opt for the phulkas. Total ""paisa-vasool"" ! :)"
5.0,OMG coming here on weekends is a task because it really is crowded.. Ambiance is really good and hatke from rest of the restaurants.. The food is yummy yummy and great variety.. I love eating here..
4.0,"This is a nice typical North Indian restaurant. I would rate ambience to be 3.5 on 5. Decent service. Must try Bhindi Rajasthani. Starters were delicious. Aam panna was good. But, Masala soda tasted sweet :( Main course was neatly prepared and served."
1.5,Ambience is Gud in hotel.  Food was not tasty.  Main course's sides were salty and also in starters.  Service  was poor.  They literally expected us to eat/order quickly..  So u can't enjoy ur food. And also there is no parking facility for the hotel. Only thing which we all enjoyed was butter milk and gulab jamun sweet. Food was not tasty.
3.5,"Tasty food, sufficient quantity, pretty good service. Sunday evening has a wait time of 30 minutes to an hour. But seriously the food was not that long a wait."
5.0,Place made my hardcore non-vegetarian friends to treat vegetarian food with equality.  Social Reformers(the food):  Rajasthani Bhindi Jaljeera  Garlic Naan and many more.
4.0,"Located in Raheja Complex, Koramangala. You can easily spot this from outside with people crowded around it. WELCOME -You have to wait outside, and the waiting area is quite clean, they provide you menu card to decide what to eat and order before you sit to dine in. AMBIENCE - They have kept ambience quite traditional and it's really different. Overall good. VARIETY - so many dishes on menu, you must try different dishes. You also find many Satvik food options, so that's really cool. FOOD- Paneer Kurmura was new we tried, it was spicy overall good. Malai Kofta - it's on sweeter side, good. Bhindi Masala- it was fried crispy Bhindi, had first time, served before meal. Dal Fry - the yellow dal, was quite spicy, too much garam masala was in it. Shikanji- Best drink to order Jeera Rice were also good. Breads- Garlic Parantha is a must try, tava rotis are also good and larger in size than others. QUANTITY- One dish and 4 pieces of bread are adequate for 2 people. PRICE- It's worth it, take family and friends and treat them. Overall The place is must for those who like Spicy food, and a families where different people have different food choices like w/o onion Garlic etc."
3.0,"I happened to got to this place for an office team lunch.   Place has an authentic look and feel. We had the thali, it had a good selection of vegetables and dal. Paneer was average. Jeera rice had no flavor.  Not a place to expect good service."
4.0,"I must say that this place serves really tasty North Indian food ... Not sure what to take ? try just Thaali :) Totally rural feeling when you go inside.... Only problem i faced was long wait time ,   Ohh Yes... This is pure Vegetarian Restaurant so i liked it even more :)                                                                 verdictbyme.in"
3.5,Bhindi Rajasthani - 3.5 Babycorn Masaledar - 3 Veg Thali - 3.5  Masala Buttermilk/ Lassi / Jaljeera/ Fresh Lime Soda - 5  Rating is purely based on my experience
4.5,"This is a must go to place if you've been missing North Indian food for a while.   Had simple meals - daal handi, fulka, steamed rice. I'm a green chilli lover and was elated to feast on their fried chillies - these add a unique flavour to my taste buds.   Very interesting beverages - we had shikanji and Pudina jaljeera both of which were very tasty."
3.0,A lot of hype surrounding this place..... Have been to a lot of vegetarian restaurants before didn't live up the hype in my case atleast..... Very impressive interiors..... Good ambience and courteous staff..... The tastes are quite appreciable.
3.5,"They had a waiting for the lunch time.But they also ask you to place the order while waiting for  table. They managed the waiting very fast and efficiently. The ambiance has a sort of rustic touch. They have proper tables and some large for the large groups or families.Those for families are not high and are accompanied by small chairs for the children.  The plates are Thali style and the tumblers are heavy. Now the food.We had bhindi anardana and karahi paneer.The bhindi/okra was Cooked with pomegranate seeds.In North it usually the dried pomegranate seeds to lend a tang to bhindi.Also in North the chunks of bhindi are smaller but here they were large. But never the less it was spicy and not sticky. Karahi paneer also tasted good.The paneer though was a little chewey and not very soft.It was Cooked with large chunks of capsicum and tomatoes slightely sauteed or  seemed to be a later addition.The tomatoes probably served as garnish.However the veg Pulao was delicious, spicy and with  good amount of peas.It was served with fresh raita.Buttermilk was cool & refreshing.Seems value for money."
4.0,"Had been there today for dinner. I was planning to have makki ki roti sarson da saag for a long while and finally found those on Gramin's menu...I had ordered the same as mentioned before, and along with that lachha paratha and gobi masala.. makki ki roti was good , only it had a little too much butter on it I think, and I got confused after seeing it, whether they have given butter roti by mistake :P sarson da saag and gobi masala tasted good...quantity and quality of the food was good, service was a bit slow when we ordered for the first time, but later it was fine...ambience and the background music was really nice and made me feel cosy..overall a good experience and a recommended one when you want to explore the vegetarian world.."
4.5,"Good vegetarian restaurant in Koramangala. Food is really good, very hospitable .. good ambience. Had been with family. Weekdays are best to visit as the place is less crowded."
4.5,This place is simply awesome for the food! Ambience is good. I mean that you will be comfortably seated. Starters are okay types. Main course is yum! And provides Jain food! That's really nice for ppl who prefer. Cost is really good. Meaning not a rock on your pocket so don't worry and order. Full fledge for two would be 5~650.
4.5,Though its serves only fr vegetarians...It's JST finger licking!D paneer kurmura was awsm..It's always d frst optn fr a veg day!AL other dishes r also a mst try.though d price is little high BT I feel dats worth!
3.5,"Food - 3.5/5 Service -4.5/5 Ambience - 5/5 Price - 4/5(Reasonable Price) Would I visit again - May be This is a veggie friendly place with variety of options in their sabzi category The place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon and we had to wait for 10mins before getting a table. The waiter takes your order during your wait which is good cause you don't have to wait much once you get the table. Although service is good but the food was not extraordinary. Starters were good, the main course was slightly disappointing. We ordered for a gramin briyani which was mentioned spicy on the menu but turned out to b bland and tasted exactly like pudina rice.  Ambience is good with old Hindi songs playing in low volume which I appreciate..! Food still can get better!"
4.5,"Home Food and ambience away from home with Good Hospitality.... Been to here number of time with Family, friends and colleagues... Must visit place for Veggies for Quality Food....   What more .... Have a look on few items I tried.... Harbarah Kabab, Banjara Paneer Tikka (Must Try), Paneer Butter Masala, Butter Kulcha, Gramin Biriyani, Corn Pulao, Paneer Keema Pulao, Ghee Rice, BabyCorn Masala, Lasoni Paneer (Must Try)"
4.5,Had been here with family and was truly surprised by the awesome vegetarian food that was served.  One of the rare places where you are spoilt for choice in vegetarian menu.  Bhindi and karela sabzi are must try from the menu.
3.5,"I visited this place last week with my friends. It is a nice place with decent ambiance with food tasting like home. It's pure veg so it is a delight for all vegiess... It is quite pocket friendly. There was khata meetha pudhina paani which was just amazing. One should definitely try it, especially in summers. We went on Saturday evening, so it was very crowded. People were waiting outside for their turn because of which service people were trying finish our food nd billing as quickly as possible.  So that is one negative I should point out about service, but since they were trying to do their best to accommodate others, it could be ignored.  Overall food was great. Must visit for all the veggies...!!"
5.0,Really good Ambiance!! Combine that with great food and lovely service. Gramin is one of the best vegetarian restaurants in Bangalore. Love coming here with my family..
1.0,"I would Rate it negative.. Food tasted worst, service was horrible.. They want you be in the restaurant order food, pay money and leave - doesnt matter whether you eat it or not. Within 10 mins of getting food, hotel staff started asking us whether we are done. Ordered tanduri roti, phulka, sarson ka saag, methi mutter and pulao. Out of these only phulka was good.. Rest all tasted horrible. Starter was ok ish.. Dont remember the name of Starter."
5.0,"Really enjoyed this place. The service was quick, food was delicious. It would fit right into your budget. I would definitely come back here again."
4.0,I have been to Gramin quite a few times now. It is like a family pure vegetarian restaurant. It was good to see that they had started serving evening snacks too.  We called for an aloo paratha and chola bhatura. Both paratha and bhatura were huge. I loved the taste.  We also ordered for a masala tea which they served in a transparent chai glass.  A must try specially for vegetarians.
4.5,Typical pure vegetarian North Indian food. As the name suggests designed like a village. Food was served in thali and was very tasty. Place was full when reached but it was worth waiting.
4.5,Put a finger on any of the curry in the menu and order it. You won't regret anytime. Best place to have food if you are vegetarian. Best location. The only concerned thing here is waiting time. Need to wait hell lot of time.
3.5,I know this place can serve much better food than what I ordered. Maybe I was really unlucky enough to order Paneer Kadhai masala and phulka. Trust me one must never order them. I was also not satisfied by their service. Ordered phulka and they served it after 20-25 minutes that too in the room temperature.
5.0,One of the best north Indian vegetarian restaurant in Bangalore! Ambiance - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Food - 5/5 ( good variety and great taste) Pocket friendly as well..
4.0,"This place is situated right at the centre heart of Kormangala, anybody looking for organic and typical Veg restaurant, this is the place to Go.   Ambience: Simple and yet elegant but I felt little cramp between the tables which allocated. A little squeeze here and there   Service: quite good and decent, but at the time of rush hours, bit waiting for long hrz needed. Best part is while you waiting u can order the food and will be served hot when u get the table.   Food : quality of the food is good, as the restaurant says they only use Organic vegetables. Good quality vegetarian restaurants in Bangalore is little hard to find now. I believe this restaurant stands out for the quality and taste of the food. U should try basket roti recommended  Summary: over all nice place to enjoy your meal if your looking for typical good tasty food with your family, must visit for all vegetarians foodies."
3.5,Had a Sunday dinner.  They were trying to manage the waiting well but I find ordering before seating odd.   Ambiance and music is really nice.  I would say good service as well.  Food is decent but I did not find it extraordinary.  Most of the food was served hot.  Quantity is good and it is pocket friendly.
4.0,"A good vegetarian choice in Raheja Arcade.It's usually crowded with people waiting outside, but since we went there by 7pm, we didnt have to wait at all. They have small chairs and tables for large groups which maybe a problem for people with long legs  It was my second time here and yet again I enjoyed the food there. Felt that they were understaffed at the time we visited but it didn't affect the service at all. We were 9 guys, for starters we had Masala Papad, Aam ka panna, masala buttermilk, chatpata babycorn paneer, veg seekh kabab,stuff tandoori aloo For main course we had gramin veg, Malai Kofta, Meethi Malai Mattar, aachari paneer with Kulcha. I didnt like meethi Malai Mattar as they didn't taste as I thought they would and veg seekh kabab seemed more dry. Really loved their Aam ka panna, Malai Kofta, aachari paneer and gramin veg. I would love to visit again :-)"
1.0,"This place was on my wishlist for a longtime, sadly it was an underwhelming experience. The ambience was tasteful. But food was average. We order paneer tikka dhuendar- the smoke makes fr good presentation but taste was average but it was the best of the items we ordered. Then we took mirch do pyaza with garlic naan and chilli butter roti. The mirch do pyaza was not good at all. Some spice was extra couldn't put finger on which one it was. We also ordered Thali which was ordinary. The Dal tadka was not at all good in the thali and the potato dish was sweet. The flavours were unbalanced in almost all the dishes. I was disheartened as I had a lot of expectations after reading all the rave reviews of this place."
4.5,"This happens to be my second home. Been here a dozen times. Love the aloo parathas with curd, which they were kind enough to serve a huge unruly group of ours even after they were almost shut down. Absolutely great service. The gramin biriyani is a different dish and might surprise your taste; their rose lassi is something my Punjabi friend swears by, so might be something to try; the roti basket gives a good option of breads, liked the garlic kulcha. The music here on most days are spell binding, sending u promptly back to the golden days. Great decor"
4.0,When missing home food . Go to Gramin. Good food. Good service. Only one draw back you have to wait for the seat as it is crowded in the night.
1.0,"Worst guys ever,i ordered phirni stuffed kulcha and the waiter got stuffed kulcha on complaining the same ,he went back and got the same stuff"
4.5,Copper copper and copper it is!  Well themed restaurant. Pure veg. Flavourful thali. Vegans out there this is a must try restaurant for u indeed. Overflows ur tummy with its quantity...! Reasonable price for thali.
4.5,"For all those who are missing home food.. this is the best place you must try!! Gramin as the name tells has a typical village ambience. Very soothing and comfortable decorated very nicely and decently. Coming to the food, gramin serves one of the best vegetarian home-like food and the customers always leave the place satiated. Had been for lunch with my friends and ordered a Thali.. a banjara paneer tikka starter and sweet corn soup. I felt the paneer tikka needed more spice. But the Thali was too good. It had an aloo fry and paneer curry, dal makhani, gulab jamun, raitha, phulkas, papad and jeera rice.. it was delicious. And at the last we ordered a lassi and jaljeera.. both were equally amazing till the last sip!!  You would definitely come out with a ""tummy-kush"". And prices are very reasonable."
4.5,"Best vegetarian food in Bangalore! My parents love eating here, good ambiance and good variety of dishes.. Service is quick and go here with a reservation on weekends..."
5.0,"This place is the BOMB!! Best vegetarian food in town... Love the dishes here and good variety as well.. Overall, always a great dining experience here...."
4.5,"Pure Veg as I like . Among one of the best Vegetarian north indian restaurant in bangalore . Located near Forum Mall.Yummy food, lovely ambience with old melodies songs. Hot gulab jamun is a must try :)"
5.0,"Awesome place. Very Dhaba like feeling in there. Food was tasty and delicious. Loved the way they serve the food. Fast service, classy look, delicious food. A must go place for all Vegetarians out there."
4.0,My all tym favorite place as I M a vegetarian. Aloo chutki is one of my fav dish. Also Hara bhara kabab.. All dishes are really good. But always have to wait for long tym
4.0,This place pure veg. We went here on Saturday for dinner. We waited for 30 minutes. Food was awesome. Ambience is quite good. Fast service. Just you need to order it before. Don't go for Naan or Roti. Go for tawa phulka.
4.0,"Amazing interiors, calm, village like ambiance, loved this place on a first sight! They have all kinds of handicraft art handing on their walls, which is worth adoring.  Located in a prime location ( Koramangala) this is fairly easy to locate.  The staff here are courteous and this restaurant does serve food quicker than most of the North Indian restaurant. Kudos for that.  I had their ""Thali @ Lunch"" and masala buttermilk. The Thali is quite affordable 136 and fills you up! This is a very good package. Hope they serve it on Sundays also.  The Thali had Baby Potato Sabzi, Butter Paneer, Dal, raita, Gulab Jamun, jeera rice, papad and 4 chapatis.  The potato Sabzi was good and homely,  the butter paneer was sweet to my liking nevertheless it tasted good,  the raita was bland ordinary at best,  Papad was good, Chapatis were homely Laden with ghee. Jeera rice was ordinary with jeera burnt. Gulab jamun was really good.  The star was masala buttermilk, it was spicy and had a lot of coriander leaves it. Loved that flavour. A must have here.  Overall this place is a great visit if you want to have your fill without burning a hole in your pocket, the ambiance is great, will surely remind you of the rural atmosphere in India.  Taste 3.5  Ambiance 5.0 Value for money 4.0 ( a slight improvement in taste and they are surely 5.0)"
4.0,Had been here with cousins few days ago..Its alwys good to be here its one of the good restaurants in kormangala..good service good food..place lil conjusted but taste n other things cover it up well...
1.5,The food is very good... soups are ok.. cutlery n crockery needs to be improve... needs to reduce rates .. chairs r not comfortable for family members the chair height needs to long
5.0,"Awesome food, authentic taste, nice environment, supporting staff, North Indian people must try, masala chaaz is awesome, we tried thali every thing is tasty."
5.0,"Must try place for all the North Indian food lovers!!  I went to this restaurant for dinner weeks ago and I still can't get it off my mind! The food was amazing. I have never ordered Baigan ka bharta at a restaurant but on a suggestion from a friend, I ordered it and I am short of words to write how good it was!! We had Bharta, Paneer curry, Phulke, Gulab Jamun, Boondi Raita. Every thing was so yummy and fresh. If I get a choice between Om Pure Veg n Gramin, I will definitely choose this one. What a great place to serve your taste buds with some awesome food.    Thank You Gramin for the quick service and great food!!"
4.5,"Best place for vegetarians  Food - 4.5/5  Ambience - 4/5  Service is excellent - 4.8/5  They will serve pretty quickly, it doesnt matter how much crowd is present  Coming to the food, please try thandai drink, its one of the best in Bangalore  I visited this place with my friends for the first time, i fell in love with this place and then i visited again with my family and everyone in my family loved it too."
4.5,"One of my favourite place to have north india food. Place is very close to Forum. Ambience is ethnic style. Food is simply great. I am big fan of Chana Masala, Missi Roti and Aam Ka Panna / Lassi. Papad Curry is worth trying as well. Place is very pocket friendly and service is swift too. Overall- Its a definitely worth trying place if you are super hungry and want to try authentic north indian food."
1.0,"This is hopelessly pathetic in terms of customer service. Go there only if you have time and patience to wait. It has unique way of taking order first and then wait, doesn't matter if you have booked the table before or not. Food is also below average and I don't know what's the fuss is about!!"
4.5,"It is a surprise, that I am rating, Gramin- a vegetarian restaurant, as 4.5/5, being a non-vegetarian to the core and that I am not really fond of the opposite. However, due to an insistence from Jain friend and my wife, I was compelled to visit the wonder at, Raheja Arcade, Koramangala, Bangalore. We availed the combo meal. The items tasted great, especially the crispy corn. The theme of the restaurant was so very 'Gramin' (from village or rural) and was truly interesting. I loved the food and the ambience. After the Iskon restaurant, Govinda's in Kolkata, West Bengal, I won't mind to go for a meal at Gramin, once more, if an opportunity strikes."
4.5,One word awesome!   This place is the best for people who like Indian food.  Great food Value for money A one stop destination for all those who are planning to give a treat to a huge group of friends.  The only con to this place is you cannot book a table on call and usually the waiting time is about 15-20 mins.  It's always busy and that's for a reason.                                                                  areadbetweenthelines.blogspot.com
3.5,"Food is great. Starters are tasty & flavoursome. Dal was super awesome & Spicy as I prefer to have, finger licking good..!! Jeera Rice was Ok. Phulkas & other breads on menu are Ok too. Main Course Gramin Special Kofta was disappointing after a good start(er). Masala Chaas/Buttermilk was good but could have been a little more sour, personal Opinion.  To Conclude, a good restaurant for Pure Vegetarians and for Non-Vegitarains, do try if you want to save a chicken."
4.0,"Went with my friend for Sunday lunch. The ambience here gives very rustic feel. We luckily got seats immediately.  We ordered the baby corn manchurian starter. It was properly made and wasn't too oily. Yum to have. The main course was daal fry, aloo jeera, butter naan and tandoori roti. Everything was good and felt very homely tbh. And the quantity was also well proportioned. Also love their use of copper utensils."
4.5,"It's very difficult to find pure veg North Indian restaurant which is not heavy in the pocket. Gramin is one such restaurant situated in Raheja Archade Koramangala. I have there more than 4-5 times. The food is delicious. I like the ambiance also, very suburbs village themed. Great service. But the usp of Gramin is the food. Must visit for people who love North Indian food."
3.5,"Went today for Lunch. Ordered Gramin Subz, Dal Makhani, Boondi Raita and breads. Food was great, good location and courteous staff. Only thing I didn't like were the breads. Missi Roti in particular was harder when compared to the ones I've had earlier at other places. Also ordered Jal Jeera, Aam Panna and Shikanji. And they didn't disappoint us."
2.0,"The place successfully  creates an old world ambience. But,  one sincere grudge which tells a lot about the crude mentality of business owners.  We ended up ordering a little more food than we could eat and as usual did not like food getting wasted like this. So,  we decided to get it packed to give to some kid outside or take back home to eat at night maybe.  The food was not very tasty,  we just didn't want wastage and hence decided to pack.  To our surprise,  the waiter told us that we would be charged extra money to get it packed.  We were a little shocked as this was a first so we asked him what he was going to do if we just left the food there and he bluntly answered that he would throw it in the dustbin.  It was a shame to realize that where in other countries there are places where you would be charged to waste,  here we were being charged for our attempt to curb wastage.  We anyways paid the charge and got it packed.  (let me clarify the charge was very nominal,  20-30 rs I guess,  but it wasn't about the money,  it was about the mentality of the owner who did name the restaurant 'gramin'  but failed to imbibe the homliness) this brings me to the other point where we were rudely stopped at the gate because 2 of our friends hadnt arrived yet. We understand that the place had a waiting queue and so we were asked to wait till everyone came,  we did oblige the first time and peacefully waited. But even after 10 minutes when both of our friends told us that they were just 2 minutes away around the corner : even then when we asked to be seated we were denied rudely.  I think this place has become famous because of its food and unique ness but I don't think it can retain much  longer if they fail to incorporate a better well behaved staff and ethics.  As for the food : I did not find it good,  very oily rather. The drinks were spicy and good  , 2 stars just for the drinks"
4.5,"Good service with good food and the Hindi songs they play are like cherry on the icing. Being a veggie lover I would definitely recommend this place. Great North Indian served with home-like 'rotis'. Also , do try the lassi, it's awesome!!! It is better to reserve the table before hand as the place is always full."
5.0,"One of the best restaurants for North Indian cuisine. You will have to book your table in prior else will wait for about 40- 50 minutes. But worth waiting. We went for Sunday dinner. Interiors are simple wooden chairs and tables with bamboo mat spread on every table. Copper Plates and tumblers give that authentic village feel for the one in resturant. We ordered tomato soup, which was tangy enough with bread crumbs. Starters was masala papad, which was average and baby corn masaldar  was good with crispiness and spiciness. Main course was roti and paneer vindalo, which was super spicy as mentioned in the menu. Totally worth money and would like to visit again to try out their other lists in the menu."
4.0,"Good taste, ambiance is ok. Crowded on weekends. They will take your order at entrance only and then make you wait outside. A little heavy on pocket."
4.0,"Vibrant place buzzing with energy. The most courteous and efficient service I have experienced in a while. Great food is the cherry on the icing. True to it's name, the interiors are done up around the theme of a house in a village. The restaurant is packed, with long waiting queues during meal times so get there early or prepare to wait. Trust me, the wait will be worth it too, the food being so delicious! We went once more during Tea Time , to try their Nashta and though the Masala Tea scored top marks, the Samosa was bland, and disappointing. The Chana Bhatura was good though."
4.5,"Went here yesterday. Waited for 5-10 minutes for the table. Good thing they took the order while we were waiting. The ambiance is nice. Tasty food. The best part about this restaurant are the hosts. Everyone is smiling and jolly. They talk to you politely and listen carefully as well. Lovely experience. We tried the baby corn and paneer chatpata as starter. Jaljeera to drink, phulkas and kadai veg as main course. Will try thali next time as it looked tempting. Had a good experience overall."
4.0,"Wanted to have some healthy veg food after shopping at forum so used the app which suggested this place....well its exactly opposite to tea trails/burgerking/starbucks ...(.inside the shopping complex)....got seat easily didnt had to wait....ordered for butter chilli roti ,laccha paratha...paneer kohlapuri, biryani ,masala chaas ,salan ka subzi.....well the chilli roti was ok...just some chilli flakes peppered on the roti which i felt cud have been thicker considering the price charged.,laccha paratha was gud not too much oil and was done well..panner kohlapuri was awesome...spicy indeed(which was already told to us while the guy was taking the order)....we also wanted to have kofta but the person suggested is to try salan ka subzi as both of the subji wud be on the similar pattern.....he askes our preferences(spicy)and suggested us....well very gud suggesion indeed we loved it...he even said us that if we dnt like it we nned not pay for it.....must say it is the first time i had and it was just awesome......the gravy's taste still lingers in my mouth.....later on the biryani came again gud bit felt the quantity cud have been a bit more....fiNished off with the masala spicy chaas....again gud but nothing extraordinary.....bill for 2 came 880 odd....considering we ate a lot....was full as well all the time we spend over dere so i think wud be better to buk tables(if dey do)in weekends....nice place to go wen ur having cravings to eat veg healthy ones and skip junk food ..."
1.0,"One of the worst food I ever had in Bangalore.  Don't order Kaju Masala, Banjara Paneer Masala  1 star is only for Rajasthani Bhindi and Masala chaas."
4.0,"Landed in Gramin last weekend as we had planned to have some vegetarian food, for a change :D The liked the entire look and feel of the restaurant, nicely done interiors, dhaba kinda look and good arrangement and spacing. As we went over the weekend the place was jam-packed, but we managed to get a table after waiting for about 10 mins. Meanwhile we had already placed the order. We had tandoori chat, something I hadn't heard of (being a hardcore non vegetarian), parathas, roti, paneer punjabi masala something (don't recollect the name), pineapple raita and aam-panna. The food was served after 10 odd minutes. Tandoori chaat was good, something different. The sabji and paratha was also a good combination. Aam panna was fine, higher on sweet. Raita was yummy. We didn't have any dessert as they only had gulab jamun, so we chucked it. Overall the food was decent and service was fine. Best part was the cost, this place is superb on your pockets, very much cost-friendly, so heads-up for that. Definitely a good place for all veggie lovers."
4.0,Awesome authentic North Indian food a stone's throw away from Forum Mall.you may have to wait a bit if you don't have a booking. The ground floor is a bit cramped and stuffy. Ask for a table on the mezannine floor if you want to enjoy an unhurried and leisure meal. Service is prompt. Menu offers a lot of variety. Do try the jal jeera.
4.0,"Great food, great ambience but the service was a bit slow. The food is just amazing and reasonably priced too. My personal favourites are dal makhni, hara bhara kebab and the lassi."
4.0,The very first thing that attracts anyone here is the ambience. Homely food. Prices are little expensive though one surely can't miss their lip smacking food specially for one's who are away from home. Truly tastes just like the good home cooked North Indian food.
4.0,"Much has been written about Gramin, and why not! The food is absolutely delicious & pocket friendly. The aam panna and nimbu shikanji are good. Kurkuri bhindi, lacha paratha are a must try. Expect a waiting time of 15-30 mins."
4.0,I personally like the food there...very cheap and good taste food is the combination there....the thali there was good and quite filling...good food and good taste..
3.5,"Great place for vegetarian food ..North Indian cuisine.  The service is good, almost always crowded around dinner time. The food is tasty and filling with good sized portions. Great value for money."
4.0,I had been unlucky to not get a table on my previous 2 visits here but finally booked in advance and tried the food here on new years day... It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.. The gramin kofta was delicious and so was the bombay biriyani.. Pricing is reasonable and service is good..
1.5,"Gramin was one of my favorite north indian places a year back and I was really excited to visit the place again today with my family for lunch. I have never been so disappointed with a restaurant that I am writing my first review in Zomato. Firstly, the service was just terrible. Our waiter was so clueless. People who came in after us were served food before us while we kept waiting for almost half an hour. I had to send back the masala papad because it was so soggy and oily. Then fresh lime soda was more like sweet lime water (which again I sent back). The Vegetable Kolapuri was tomato puree with beans and peas. So we all had only half kulcha each and couldn't have the rest. Hence, we decided lets have gramin biryani and that will fill us up. Guess what, the rice was uncooked and tasteless. What has happened to this restaurant? Never going back again!"
5.0,Homly north indian food If that is what you are searching then this is the best place  Everything is super tasty and since it is same from so many years it is one of the fav places of my family  Lachcha paratha and lemonade and veg kofta are my fav  Looking forward to going there again
3.5,"This is a place long standing in Raheja Arcade. The taste here has not changed since years. That is why I guess a lot of people have become regular customers of this place.  You cannot eat here everyday unless you like spicy food. Once in while this place is a good change to the regular monotony.  I have been here couple of times and usually order for the meal. The meal here is Rs.135/- with the guarantee that you will not go out of the place feeling heavy.  You can choose either phulkas (4) or Rotis (2) and a small bowl of rice and with this you will get a mix veg subzi, a paneer ki subzi, a dal, a raitha and a sweet. Lime, onion pieces and pickles are accompaniments.  The food is good, tasty and spicy."
5.0,"Heaven for vegetarians that too for north indian food lovers. Must try Mirchi ka salan,  kulche, butter milk. Owner gave suggestions for what to order and how much to order...Quantity is more than expected"
4.0,"Nice non-spicy food, found dal afgani and sweet lassi very tasty. I would recommend Baby corn lababdar as veg starters. Nice service. Had a really good dining experience."
3.0,"This is the best place for vegetarian food around Forum. Ambience s good, service needs improvement. Sometimes you have to struggle to get their attention. We visited on Friday afternoon for lunch, waiting for food at our table which we ordered before getting a table. We had to tell them 2-3 times jus to serve us water which they did after the food arrived. Food is good. No matter if it's a weekday or weekend, it's always crowded! Make sure you visit when you have enough time!"
5.0,"If you're a north Indian food lover, this is the place for you. I have never had such amazing north Indian food in Bangalore. The quality of Roti is so good, it will just melt in your mouth. Makki ki Roti, Sarson ka Saag, plain roti, Dal Makhni, Shahi Paneer and lassi, everything is so amazing that its hard to pick the best one."
3.5,"Okay, so this place is good in terms of ambience and it lives up to the name.The surroundings do make you feel as if you are in a mini village house.When talking about food, I liked the babycorn as starters.However the roti basket did not satisfy me.The rotis were not that good.However, I liked the way they served."
1.0,"Been there for dinner. Ordered harabara kaba which was fairly good but costly. Paneer kurkure was quiet bad and expensive . Ordered corn soup. Yuck it was. Roti tasted bad and julcha was cold. We had ordered methi malia Matt at and it was extremely bad sweet and had to finish only because we did not want to waste. Lastly dal...it was oily, full of mustard and garlic.. finally in the bill they had put service charge.. I was mad . Plz avoid this restaurant.  Not good for the pocket and value for money"
4.0,"Went here for lunch on the recommendation of a friend. Was not disappointed at all. The service was crisp and courteous despite the extreme crowd. We had corn pulao (served with delectable raita) and kebabs. We also had buttermilk and sweet lassi. Everything tasted great.  Next time I would like to try their thaali. Somehow I doubt anything of theirs would let me down. Really good ambience and lighting as well. Definitely recommend it. Of course, it's pure vegetarian."
2.0,I had visited this place a couple of years back when the food used to be tasty. But things have changed for the worse. They add too much masala to everything. We ordered a baby corn dish and it was hard to even chew. Gramin's Veg kofta has been the worst one i have eaten far. Kofta was so hard that we could not even break it to eat with the gravy! Overall a bad experience which left a bad taste. There are far better restaurants in Kormangala.
3.5,"Gramin opened around 2002 and I have been visiting them since then , albeit less often in recent years. They have  expanded seating capacity which was a major limitation. Also redone interiors with the same village theme. Raheja Arcade does not allow guests parking, so good luck with finding car parking space nearby. Forum parking may be the safest bet. Review of yesterday's evening dining experience.  Karela Fry - Senior staff Chandrahaas suggested this dish as a must try. I have avoided Karela at all costs in my life. He took the risk of replacing the starter if I didn't like it. Deep fried thin Karela strips with loads of sesame (til) and cashew. It was all sesame and hardly any karela. Liked the novelty , though it wasn't mind blowing.  Sabzi ka salan - Very close to the Salan that accompanies Hyderabadi dum biryanis. Liked the gravy, but for the fact that there were less cashew and more onion in the base. A welcome change from the typical gravies I have been eating.  Laccha paratha & phulka - Average fare. At 50+ for laccha paratha given its size, I would call it overpriced.  Jeera Rice - This one was a complete let down. Basmati or Jeera Samba are the only 2 varieties of rice that taste good in Ghee rice or Jeera rice preparations.But they had used some very ordinary rice that killed the dish.  Got a cash discount of 10% for paying in cash (100s) :) A must try for pure vegetarians among the 600 + food joints in Koramangala."
4.0,"Great place for veg lovers. I had been there twice and I liked both times. Last time ordered veg chori chori (it's mix veg of raw banana, pumpkin and brinjal) with methi and phirini paratha. Paneer banjara kebab was also good. Everything is good and service is perfect."
3.5,"Heard lot of things about this place from many people and I think this is one of common place for veggie around the area.  Food: Good food with full Desi taste. But I cant say it best food. Ask them they will suggest you what you should order.  Price: Value for money. Also you will get moderate quantity.  Service: Average, for me it took long time to get food on table. Definitely waiting over weekends you will get.  Ambiance: Best part of this place is ambiance. From the name, this place is designed like a village. They will serve food in cooper/brass plates, glasses and bowl.  PS: Should try at-least once. Food will not disappoint you and their ambiance is all their USP."
3.5,"A proper dining place, one can go with friends and family. It gives the proper dhaba feel with the interiors. The service is really quick, and the staff is also very friendly."
2.5,"It is okay place. Taste wise it was very average. Sitting area was crowded, a little better sitting arrangement would be at least some relief. Hospitality was dull. Not to forget very loud guests."
4.5,"My All time favorite dine in place.. Hailing from core vegetarian family I always prefer to take my parents and in-laws to this well authentic Indian Hotel - Gramin I have always loved the ambience, the seating arrangements and of course a typical North-Indian Food. My all time bucket list includes Harabara Kabab, masala buttermilk/lassi."
3.5,"6 friend after a party at social, decided to have some veg food one of the friend suggested to have from Garmin which was very near,we ordered NAN dal makhani, jeers rice ,planner and raita and lassi,liked the dal and nan paneer was ok,the place was full when we reached ,good place for veggies"
5.0,"Well, if you haven't had food here you haven't tasted anything in Bangalore then. Wonderful place , always full (long waiting queues) , courteous staff , quick serve and yummy food. Their must haves are on the drinks menu though. The mirchi soda is my personal fav. Never miss a chance to enjoy a meal at this place."
4.0,"I visited Gramin on a Saturday night and they were kind enough to take our order though it was closing time. While we were waiting to be seated they provided us with food menu card to decide our food so that they could serve us by the time we were seated and i really like this concept .. using time wisely :) The ambiance from outside is neutral and the moment you are inside, its completely different. Without any exaggeration, it throws you back in time. The whole set up in so carefully chosen, little details of milk can, things used for cooking in old times, 70s music playing in the background, ethnic wall art etc.  Food is really good. We ordered Aloo Paratha ( was good but too thick ), Tandoori Chaat (tangy and spicy masala coated pineapple and aloo was yumm ) Sweet Lassi, Masala butter milk and Gramin Biryani ( was decent, nothing extraordinary) Service was good but very slow. Can't wait to experience their much spoken Thali!"
1.0,We found a dead cockroach in the napkin after we were done eating. Soup was bad. Starters were bad. Roti and sabji were good though. Food is made to taste good. Doesn't seem very healthy though. Would have given them a 6 if not for the cockroach. The manager was absent and we couldn't meet him even after waiting for 15 minutes.
4.5,Great place to have vegetarian food. In fact they have a lot of options for vegetarians. Budget friendly. Not highly priced. Location is good too. Ambience resembles of a village. Waiting hours are long during weekends
4.0,"Went for dinner. Even though they have only indoor seating, the ambiance is very good. You will definitely get a feel of a village upon seeing the decor. A small place, though. We took the graminpaneer and daal fry for curries. Took the phulka for roti and ordered jeera rice to go with it. Took lassi and buttermilk for drinks. The gramin paneer and daal fry are a must try. Real good taste. The lassi also is filling and tasty. Decent prices for the food and the service is generally quick. Worth a visit when near Forum."
5.0,"Such a great place. The ambience resembles that of a village. The staff and seating arrangement is nice. I still remember the lassi I had there, one of best lassis I've ever had. Food in general is great too."
3.5,"For spice lovers looking for some quality vegetarian North-Indian fare, gramin is worth a visit. We really don't mind that their curries comprise of a 60-40 proportion of spice to flavour because somehow it makes for an extremely satisfying meal. Most of their curries infact taste a little similar but are nonetheless, adequately appetizing. Pair one of their cooling drinks like jaljeera or lassi with any red/ green gravy curry, some bhindi fry, dal fry and stuffed garlic naan and you're set for the afternoon.   With it's decent portions and reasonable prices it's a good option for a quick lunch; although, you can easily give the below-par thali here, a miss."
3.5,"Calm place inside Raheja Arcade, known for its veg food. Been there a couple of times, the food is delicious, any vegetarian who likes Indian food should go there at least once. The place is not at all expensive and the theme is decent, not too shabby. Definitely worth trying again!"
2.0,"I had lots of expectations from this restaurant, as it's quite famous and rare vegetarian restaurant in koramangala But disappointed with the food Ambience - 4 (village theme ) Food - 2 Service - 3.5"
5.0,"Very good food. All items up to the mark. Great hospitality, great service timing and amazing support. Also, they live up to the expectations in terms of food quality and taste. A must go for regular family dinners, if you're fond of authentic north indian food"
4.5,"Super affordable prices,quick and good service and tasty food..what more can a foodie ask for? Gramin is surely a yummy in tummy kind of restaurant and has a great variety for being serving only veg food. It has jain options as well. Small place (you might end up waiting for sometime) but really good food. :)"
4.5,"Very wholesome food, taste just like homemade food with the staff treating you like guest in their home. Amazing bhindi fry dish a must try and finger licking good dhal tadka. Can't wait to go back"

4.5,"A perfect restaurant for vegetarians, Situated opposite to fenny's in kormangala. On weekends you have to wait for approx 20-25 minutes, but in that time you can order the food. Rates are reasonable according to the taste, ambience is according to its name Garmin. One dish I didn't like is dahi bhindi, rest all were tasty."
4.5,"And one of my fav restaurant from last 10 years. Yes... This is the first restaurant I visited with my frns when I came to Blr. And that experience was awesome. And now .. no counts of how much time I visited this place. And still loving it.   Let's talk about food. Yes this is the best place in town to get a very good taste of north Indian food. Whatever curry you order, will be  good only. And if you are ordering spicy food, then they will make sure it will spicy. And on top of that it is pocket friendly, pure veg restaurants. So go and try it. Also make sure oser thandi there. It is a good drink with food.  Keep eating !!!"
1.0,Horrible experience .  Be careful while taking change I have just lost around 600 . I agree it is my fault also but who ever is serving food even they must be loyal. Will never be going back to it again .
2.0,"The place is too crammed up to actually host a bunch people. The ambience inside was ok. We ordered crispy chilli babycorn, paneer tikka for starters and missi roti, kulcha, dal and gramin kofta for the main course. The starters were disappointing as they were cold, not at all fresh and seemed to be made earlier than we had ordered. The missi roti was too oily and the kulchas were again cold. The koftas tasted well but the dal was not prepared well. Gave a tough time to the bowels on the next day morning. The waiters are hospitable and nice. Overall food experience wasn't that good."
1.5,"After reading a lot of reviews about Gramin, I visited Gramin today with my family. It's a village theme-based vegetarian restaurant. I ordered masala papad, Paneer Kolhapuri, mix raita, and ghee fulka. Masala Papad was OK but Paneer Kolhapuri was way spicy than what it should be. I like spicy food and fond if it that's why I ordered it but it was far below my expectation. It was damn spicy and they added so much chillis that I could not even eat and my tongue was burning like hell. On a next visit, I ordered Malai Kofta and Garlic Kulcha. It was totally an underwhelming experience as the Malai Kofta was far below the standards of quality and taste. It was just sweet and tasteless with many vital ingredients missing. I felt like instead of making the gravy with cachew nuts as in the original recipe, they made a gravy of peanuts to save cost, which was a total disaster of taste.  Basically, what I understood from the past two visits is that they make the spicy gravy way beyond spicy and the sweet gravy way beyond sweet with missing good quality ingredients. That is they touch both the extremes and not something that is enjoyable to the taste. Garlic Kulcha was good in taste and had a flavourful aroma. Staff behavior was nice and we didn't have to wait on both visits because they had plenty of seats available. They served the food very well. Plates and cutlery was also heavy and top-of-the-line. The ambience is pretty decent with medium lighting and village theme. They don't charge VAT and other taxes separately just the service charge is the extra that you'll have to pay, rest is all included.The 1.5 points is only for the service and ambience. Food is a disaster."
3.5,"Once upon a time this was our regular place for lunch. Taste has come down over the years. The thali used to be a great value for money. Nowadays, there are better options nearby. If you plan to visit, better to try the a la carte. The gulab jamoon was extremely sweet and the sabji was on the spicier side. Service and ambiance is very good, even the shikanji and fresh lime soda was excellent.  Ambiance - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Food - 3.5/5"
4.0,Went to this place with friends for Lunch as they told its one of the best place for North Indian food in Bangalore. Ordered Garmin Paneer & Daal Makhani which was Tasty but Laccha Parantha & Chapati were not really great at taste. Sweet Lassi is worth trying :)  Ambiance is nice with old songs being played in background. Overall nice place to try north Indian dishes .
4.0,Lunch was good................thali was commendable...liked the gobi tandoor chat...any day you visit you should wait 20 mins to get tables......
4.5,"Good food, good ambience and good service. This restaurant emphasises on all 3 and thus was a good experience to be there. Looking at the waiting at the gates, it was understood that this is a popular hub for food, with foodies ranging from college age kids to families waiting. The pre-ordering of food, while in waiting kept the wait times lower than in a normal setting. Coming to food, I loved the Gramin Paneer, Dal Tadka. That would be my recommendation, though would visit again and try newer thing later."
3.0,"Been to this place today for lunch. We have visited this place earlier also. But compare to older days, I would say their quality is gone down now. Yes, for vegetarian people ,it's indeed good option since lots of varieties are there. But taste is definately gone down.  It is a place located in complex in Kormangala. Ambience of the place is decorated in North Indian style.It got 2 floors. Service was alright. We ordered today for Masala Papad, rajasthani bhindi fry, buttermilk, gramin kofta and ghee fulka. Masala Papad was good and not at all oily. Bhindi fry was also tasty and different with crunchiness. Till starters, we were happy But then the main course made us upset. Kofta were not at all soft though the waiter told us that it will be blend of paneer and kofta with red gravy. Secondly, gravy was not at all tasty and not cooked properly. Water was getting separated from gravy. They might not have blended and cooked properly. Taste was ok ok with all garsm masala. As far as we know, when you order kofta ,you expect the gravy to be rich in texture and koftas to be soft. It's all disappointed us.  Next time, may be we will have to try for dishes excluding kofta and paneer."
4.0,Food was very good. Both starters and main course was upto the mark. Must try- Garlic kulcha and Sweet lassi.. They should increase the space as there is always waiting for 20 minutes.
4.0,"This place is awesome for veg lovers... The ambiance was good, service was perfect, food was delicious as expected and the staffs were very nice. Paneer kadhai was superb, bhindi masala was average, kulcha n naan were proper, paneer kurkure was best...  Satisfied.."
4.0,"My friend took me here last Saturday. We ordered Banjara paneer, gamin paneer, rose lassi, methi or pudina paratha and Daal makhani. Food is delicious , ambiance is cool. Nice place for vegetarians."
3.0,"Visited Gramin after a long, long time. While the ambiance is same old, clean place, nice old Hindi songs, rustic decor, the food was a tad disappointing, compared to what it used to be. I felt the presentation has gone down, bringing change in the portion and the flavors. Even the service could be better, we were served the mains, soup and starters all within a gap of 5 mins. The Paneer Tikka Masala didn't really have the punch, and had an element of ketchup. Same with the Tomato Soup, a tad too much vinegar had made it bitter. The Nimbu Shikanji was no where near to the one they used to server earlier, this one was more like sweetened water with a tinge of Lime. The Stuffed Aloo starter was quite bland, just paneer stuffing with no special touches which is associated with this place. Disappointed."
4.0,"...an occasional weekend where we decided to try some vegetarian food. Ended up visiting Gramin ~2.30pm in the afternoon. There was a queue but they were accepting orders which is good since waiting time to receive food reduces once you get the table. Ordered phulkas, kulcha and paneer subzi. Good taste and prompt service. Pleasant experience. Recommend others to visit."
4.5,"Went to this place on my friends suggestion. One of the best place for North Indian food in Bangalore. A well set up restaurant, old Bollywood songs, light on ur pockets and homely food. A perfect place to visit for a good sumptuous meal. I had ordered jaljeera, masala papad, methi malai paneer, butter chilly roti, lacha paratha and phirki paratha. Everything was amazing on the pallet. The paneer was really soft, like homemade and the sabzi was perfectly spiced. Good hospitality with fast service. I liked their idea of serving food in copper utensils. Very traditional !!   Will I visit again ?? For sure ! There are other dishes I am yet to try.   Taste - 5/5  Ambience - 4/5  Service and food presentation - 4/5  Value for money - 5/5   PS : I visited this place around 7pm so got a place immediately. When I was leaving he restaurant there was a huge queue waiting for their chance to gorge in the food"
4.0,It's a nice place. I love the thali and sweet corn. Nice ambience. I don't like the sweet and salt Lime soda. Serving time is a lot. We have to wait for quite a some time.
4.5,"We enjoyed the food.. It was tasty, we have ordered Paratha, palak mughlai kofta and tomato soup, panner tikka and jamoon. We liked everything other than tomato soup, which we dint like much. Services is really good here."
4.5,"I.have been eating here almost from my college days... In my list perhaps the best veg resturant in bangalore as fare as I know .... The food here justify s north indian touch and flavour compare to other north indian resturant ,, rajasthani bhindi fry is mind blowing and awsome sabjis ... Food here is absolute bliss"
2.0,Food is not up to the standard. It was a family get together with 30 members and no one liked the food. The gravy in every sabzi is different and not at all like normal restaurants
1.0,Food  and roti served with hair  They don't apologise  They justify this happens  They justify this can happen at your house also Not a good family restaurant
4.5,"Located in Raheja Arcade,Koramangla, Gramin was recmnded by one of my friends. I got an oppurtunity to visit this place on a diwali afternoon for lunch. The place was crowded as expected and we had to wait for 5 mins before we could get in. As the name suggests the ambience is like a typical village which gives you a very nice feeling. So we took aur seat and ordered some masala papads initially. With full of masala onion and tomatoes on top the papads were filling and delicious. For main course we ordered veg kadhai and paneer kadhai with some ghee fulkas. Paneer was quite peppery and spicy. Veg kadhai was good too. Fulkas were the thinnest I ever had. Overall a highly satisfied lunch and would love to be here again."
5.0,"One of my favorite vegetarian food restaurants. Very easy to locate and not very heavy on your pockets for the quality and quantity of food they provide. Their naan, paratha, curries- everything is simply fantastic. They are also a major crowd puller, so make sure you go grab a seat fast !"
3.5,"I have visited this place twice now. It has that old, rustic feel to it. It is an extremely good option for vegetarians.  Food is quite decent. I personally loved the Kesar Lassi. Paneer items were not upto the mark. Seekh kabab was good.  The place can become very crowded during peak hours. Ambiance is really nice. They were playing amazing, old hindi songs. Waiters were really courteous.  The price is quite less. No tax, only service charge is added in the final bill."
4.0,"Been here for lunch. Food was tasty. Both quality and quantity were good. We had malai kofta, paneer do plaza, butter kulcha and thandai. Liked all. Staff was courteous. Nice, compact and pocket friendly restaurant. If you're vegetarian and like North Indian food, this is the place for you."
3.5,Been here and the ambience was cool. We got a ice cozy corner table. The service was quiet fast and for a non vegetarian like me I found the veg spread quiet  exhaustive and the food was really nice. Overall had a  wonderful dinner. They don't have car parking and had trouble in it.
4.5,"Loacated in a complex in Koramangala, which took us a little time to find. It is very neatly decorated the north indian way. It isnt air conditioned. A decently crowded place with 2 floors.   We ordered a soup, breads and a paneer dish. The soups were heavy and creamy.  The garlic kulcha was the best ever i have tasted. It was quite filling with the spicy paneer gravy.   A very authentic place for North Indian items :)"
4.0,Been to this place fr sunday dinner... nice ambience ... nice atmosphere ... Food is gud but too spicy... we ordered it to less but they served it too spicy... kulcha n naan were lil hard... but pulka is so soft n luved it so much... Plz try to hav pulka... Pocket friendly veg restaurant .....
5.0,A 5 start vegetarian restaurant which serves awesome food and is very pocket friendly. An ideal place for a large group reunions or gettogether. Everything is nice about it. Do go early because they always have a long queue
3.5,"The food is very tasty here. I have been here couple of times but writing for the first time. Their chilli roti is something to try for sure. Also, this time we ordered paneer dhuaadhar starter it literally is dhuaadhar. All in all good food.  But.... So twice i went here and both the times they didn't return the balance amount after the bill. First time i went the bill was 800rs and we had given 1000rs. I came out as my father was in the washroom till then he didn't give me the money back. so my father thought i took the change and i thought he took. I know it was our mistake but even he didn't say anything. This time me and my friends went and our bill was 720 rs and we gave 1000rs but he just returned 80rs instead of 280rs. As i have had the experience i asked him for the remaining amount so he said sorry i forgot.  Long story short please check the amount they're giving back."
4.0,One of the best places for Veg.  Taste has been very consistent over the yrs & the quality is taken care of.  Have been visiting over several yrs & never disappointed.  The price too is very nominal
4.5,As the name explains the place has the ambience of a village. The taste of food is awesome. They have some awesome panzer dishes and starters.  The staff is very focussed and active. Only thing is you have to wait a lot for your number. All in all its worth of every penny.
4.5,Very delicious food at very chap rates. Ordered hara bhara kabab and paneer dhuadaar as starters. The main course was also very delicious. The owners have made a good use of the place and created a nice ambiance. The gulab jamuns were the highlight of the meal. A must visit family restaurant.
4.0,"Its a vegetarian delight - It is very near to forum mall. On weekends this place is full. One may have to wait for at least 45 minutes to get a table. But everybody waits because the food is that sort. You will enjoy the veg food to a good extent. The aesthetics and seating are good, spacious. Good place to go with family and friends."
4.0,2 meals ...10 years apart....yet alike. Gramin retains its signature decor and awesome taste. Service is delightful. While we waited our order was taken and delivered soon after we got a table.  For starters Baby corn paneer Allahabadi was mildly spicy and a must have. The gentleness of Gramin veg and the spicy punch of phirki kulcha does a tango in the mouth. Our kiddo loved the creamy curd rice.
4.5,"Went there for a team lunch. Fantastic ambience and decor. Full marks for the professional waiters too. Our team ordered veg food, starters and main course that was surprisingly very tasty and quickly served. Do try veg starters and their sweet lassi. Authentic north Indian 'fulkaa' a must try too!  I recommend a couple of friends too, who confirmed that nonveg food was equally delicious.  Looking forward to more visits soon :)"
4.5,"The place is an excellent choice for veg food. The food is awesome and so is the interior and ambience. Although there is a little wait period, but the experience makes it worth it. Price is also economical. Definitely visiting again."
3.0,"Average food, good ambience and perfect location in a busy area. Food definitely has scope for improvement. Rice varieties are spicy and better than the rotis of the world. One lassi is too much for one. Definitely can b shared. Same with butter milk. Reserve some spare time for delays in getting food ordered to your table. Cheers!!"
4.5,Been here multiple times... great food.. Never dissapoints... Awesome paneer dishes... their Dal afghani is all time favourite.. rice dishes are notable.... Ambience: good. based on village theme Staff and service: very prompt staff and fast service Food: great... everything they have in their menu is worth trying  overall a great experience with an authentic north indian taste... Hope they start home delivery also..
4.5,"Gramin as the name tells, its kind of a Village Theme Restraunt. Ambience and service was good and coming to food, we ordered Basket rotis, sabzi ka salan, gulkand milk shake, lemon juice. Chatka gobi was awesome, though it was very much spicy  and Gulab Jamoon was yummy.  Overall it was a good experience in Gramin. Recommend others to try in this restraunt."
4.5,This place is so coonectdd to Pubjab  In  true sense it's Gramin  The ambience is lovely and the food was yummy Especially the Sweet lassi and I highly recommend Babycorn masala  Pocket friendly too  Nd the food is non oily too .
4.5,"Bored of the everyday cafeteria lunch in our office, 7 of us were desperately searching for a resto serving good North Indian cuisine on zomato. Our eyes popped when we browsed across Gramin. So cheap and such a good rating ! We gasped, as we unanimously agreed upon this place !  The place is near forum mall, in Raheja arcade. When I entered it made me feel like those huts in the villages :) The place was jam packed and people were busy booking their reservations ! We too had to wait for about 20 mins before getting a good place to sit, right on top ! The food we ordered were just awesome. Right from the appetisers to the starters, the main course everything tasted really well. The service was a bit slow, understandable though, as the place was too crowded ! Overall a great experience and a must visit place !"
3.0,Ambience is really good but food is not good.  We ate paneer kolhapuri and dal makhni....  Both were OK. Paneer was not cooked in gravy. Stuff kulcha is nothing but paneer naan.
4.5,It has authentic veg food. The place is always crowded and there is quite a bit waiting but they have a person noting your order so that by the time you get a table your order is ready. I loved the malai kofta here
4.0,Had been there once. Would love to be there many more times. Ambience and food quality was really great. The only problem is that you may have to wait a lot to get a table and food service is also a bit slower.
4.0,"When it comes to having Veg in BTM , Gramin is the first name which comes in mind. Good food with good ambience but the waiting time is something we think about before visiting the place."
4.5,"First talk about the ambience, it is awesome. From the moment I entered the place, I was looking all over the place. The sitting, posters, and all the little things they hanged on wall gives a feeling of tradition. Second about service, it is super fast and good. We didn't have to wait much. And talking about food, they have mostly north Indian food and it is pure vegetarian. My friend is a hard core non-vegetarian but she loved the veg food here and even agreed to come again. We ordered aalu dum masala, paneer handi in main course. They are good. I liked their garlic kulcha. For starters we ordered paneer kurkure, I didn't like it much."
3.5,"A family of 6 for Lunch on 25th September2016.  Pros: Service - 5/5. Quick and efficient even on a Sunday. Rose lassi and Aam Panna was good. Gulab Jamoon was good.  Cons: Spicy Buttermilk: The mint chutney that they gave with starters was mixed into this to make it spicy. Soda Hari Mirch: It was just soda with Mirch floating, no hint of mirchi in the taste. AfganiKaju Paneer was very bland."
5.0,"Food,ambience and customer service.These all things comes with minimum expense incurred,and that too in Koramangala area.It indeed made my day."
4.5,"I must say after a long time i had authentic veg food here. The food is awesome and so the people. We ordered Tandoori Chat for starters and this is the spiceist starter i have ever eaten but awesome. The main course served well on time and it was  delicious. The ambience gives a feel if village side and soothing. The best of all was background old hindi song. Only suggestion, just add some more lights around the walls. A must visit place."
4.0,One cute little place tucked inside raheja arcade koramangala  Veg friendly what ever I ordered was so yummy I ordered kaju masala which was spicy along with rotis /fulkas Never forget to have rose or mango lassi here  Ambience is not so big but they have made it look like rustic and village like food here is mostly north Indian food  Usually crowded during lunch hours so you have to wait for your table
4.5,"Awesome north Indian food! The ambience is very realistic and close to a village. The walls look as if they are made of mud, although they are not. They serve pure vegetarian food. We ordered Palak paneer, Veg Seekh kabab, Bhindi masala, Dal fry and Roti. All of it were tasty and wasn't insanely oily too. We ordered drinks also, Aam panna, Jaljeera, Masala Soda. They prepared it really well.  Service was really fast. Staff is good."
5.0,"Just one word ""WORTH"". This place gives you value for money and food is great. What else would you wish for ?  Hospitality is really good and ambience is decent. Guess this place will be no 1 in my list as I am a vegetarian and I never had so tasty  veg food in  Bangalore."
4.5,My husband is a hard core non veg eater but if I agree to dine here he readily agrees to eat veg..so imagine how good the food is...panner bhuna..chilli roti...shikanji...gramin biryani...handi panner some of r fav dishes..must visit place
5.0,"One of the most amazing veg restaurant I ever been in my life, I would rate 5 for the food quality and taste, their malaai kofta, amazaing amazing food, I'll definitely be visiting this place whenever I visit Bangalore again. I would strongly recommend this place to all the veg foodies."
4.0,"Vegetarian restaurant in kormangla. As name suggest it takes you to village homly feeling. Nice ambiance, seating arrangement. Foods taste good and not much of Oli and spice, 100% value for money."
4.0,"Its a popular food joint serving north Indian veg food in Kormangala. They have an interesting village house theme with everything in accordance: the interiors, the get up of the waiters, utensils etc.  Almost every time there will be waiting, especially during dinner time. The service is fast and food is mostly good, just that I find their curries a bit more on the spicier side. The menu has a good amount of options to choose from. I have tried tomato soup, gramin veg, paneer baby corn jalfrezi, veg kofta, dal makhni; all of them were prepared and served well!"
4.0,Surprisingly economic tat too near Forum an places like Punjab Grill!. Make sure you reach well before their closing time. Food is authentic and ambience justifies the name also. Must visit place!
4.5,It was all of a sudden plan. Landed at gramins. Heard about the vegetarian food and the ambience. A good place to have a good meal for the vegans and the non-vegans too. Tried Rajasthani bhindi for starters. Then comes in the variant main course which was good. Overall the place is good.. Food is good.. Service is little slow and the crowd is huge. Luckily we got a table for 4. Service tax is too high. But still reasonable price for the food. A must try for who haven't yet.
4.5,"One of the finest and economic veg restaurant in this area, the food quality is extremely impressive.The menu have range of varieties for every section., every meal is blissfull. p.s. do try bhindi rajasthani :)"
4.0,"We bunch of friends were strolling and shopping in Koramangala, after a tiresome stroll we realized we should grab some good food(brunch).On a friend's suggestion we ended up in GRAMIN which is located in 7th block and is walkable distance to Forum mall.OMG! Such an awesome first experience wrt food, ambiance and service. Literally I have had the best veg food so far. It was finger - Licking good. I suggest a must visit to all veggiterians ."
4.0,"Restaurant seemed to be widely popular as it was crowded even on the weekday. Foods were served in special thalis, ambience was reflecting more of a village look. We ordered man-chow soup which was extremely tasty, rest of the main course items were also very nicely prepared. A must to visit restaurant once in a few days in my list."
4.0,"Before writing any details I will say this is a must go place and don't miss there awesome Lassi.  I have been to Gramin multiple times and I like there Dhabha, village decoration. The staff is quite friendly here. The prices are also good and if you are a North Indian missing the north Indian gravies in bangalore I will say this is they place you are looking for."
3.0,Desi north Indian food which was good but nothing special to die for. Ambience is average and place was very small. Service is average. Long waiting queue outside. 15 to 30 min waiting on weekends. Worth visiting but nothing more than a one time watch movie.
4.0,"In a city of over priced restaurants... Gramin is a welcome change. It doesn't pinch your pocket (at all). And the food is good...an all vegetarian north Indian fare with a fairly large menu to choose from.  The dcor is as the name suggests...though it doesn't quite go all the way. The .5 goes there.  For the food, service and the cost...this place is a 4.5/5."
3.5,Pretty decent place for a veg meal. The captain was courteous. Didn't have to wait. Got a table easily. Can get a bit congested though as its a small place.
3.5,"Pocket friendly restaurant. Good if you are a vegetarian fellow because this is a pure vegetarian place. We ordered stuffed tandoori aloo, veg vindaloo,kaju masala,veg soup and ghee phulka.  Stuffed tandoori aloo- roasted potatoes stuffed with paneer. Taste is awesome rating 4/5  Veg vindaloo- vindaloo is a gift from Portuguese to Goan. This dish is contain Indian spices, Kashmir chilli and toddy vinegar. But here I think they don't use authentic masala for vindaloo. I am damn sure they don't use Kashmir chilli and toddy vinegar( vinegar extracted from coconut) . For this dish I wish to give 2/5  Kaju masala - kaju masala is really good. Not that much spice and taste is smooth. Rating 3.5/5  For raita, soup and phulka rating is 4/5   Ambiance : 3.5/5  Advice to management: as you are a rural dish themed restaurant must use less oil in all dishes. Vikash Periwal"
5.0,"Been there after a long time. And its as lovely as it was 5 years back. The ambience perfect fit friends and family. Food is DELICIOUS. The songs played were perfect, good collection. A FEAST for VEGGIES..!"
4.0,De oly plc wr I don mind eating a veg thali..  .. Good food n ambiance... Even de service is fine... My favorite is bhindi masala.. It's yummmm
4.5,"Gramin is located in Raheja Arcade in Koramangala 7th Block right in front of Burger King. First of all, table reservation is highly recommended if possible because the rush is way too much. Next, the moment you enter it feels as if you have been teleported to a whole new world altogether. With bright yellow lights at every corner possible and with a theme that screams of a village and olden days, Gramin for sure is going to bring a smile to your face accompanied with amazement. The banjara paneer korna was spicy and nice, combining the flavours of pudina and paneer in a lovely way. Gramin kofta was decent enough. The rose lassi was just the perfect way to end the dinner. The only wrinkle was the service took a little bit of time."
5.0,"We visited the restaurant for the first time. It is economical, and service was very fast and good. Food is very tasty. Ambience is good, and all plates, glasses are made of copper, We ordered Tomato soup, Chatka Gobi, Masala Papad, Pulka with Ghee, Phirki paratha."
4.0,"Hi Gramin,  You have stopped delivering through Swiggy, please share if you have any plans to start it again?  Thanks"

4.0,"A very authentic place for north Indian cuisine lovers! Loved the ambience, and the service( Very friendly people). We ordered chatpata baby corn and paneer as starter, kulchas, phulkas, dal fry (Jain) and dhaba veg. All of them were prepared excellently with perfect amount of spice. The quantity and quality is lot more compared to most places I've been to. And the best part was the service was fast though it was a busy Sunday afternoon. Would love to go back! :)"
4.0,"We were the ones to leave th restaurant last. Literally.  Being soo late, I didn't expect th restaurant to be still open, good thing it was. The food, as said being without artificial flavors, was yummy. Chach was obviously a cherry on the top for the village look they have gone for.   Might visit soon again."
3.5,"A good place for vegetarian families looking for North Indian food. Well priced and well cooked food. The only wrinkle was the service took a little bit of time, Nice place and yummy food ..."
3.0,This was my 5th visit to Gramin.. and I have a mixed review for this place.. ordered the most talked about dish here- Bhindi Rajasthani in every visit. The taste is never consistent. It was either too salty or bitter.  Tasted best only during my first visit. The baby corn starter which was suggested by the staff tasted just like having baby corn dipped in ginger garlic paste. The paneer dishes aren't that great to find a mention here. The Malai Kofta is the best of the lot. The kulchas are stuffed with paneer and taste yumm. The soda hari mirch and shikanji are quite good. Mumbai tava pulav is flavourful. But all in all its quite a hyped restaurant when it comes to the taste of the food. Parking is an issue too.   the staff is cordial and very polite..
1.0,Heard a lot about this place.. Visited it on a weekday.. First ones to enter around 7ish.. Disappointed!! Right from the soup everything was really bad.. Extremely spicy.. Soup was like tomato pure.. Masala papad literally had big green chillies.. Sabjis were bland.. Bombay pulao was more like home made suateed rice.. Service was lethargic.. Inspire of arriving early.. Thoroughly disappointed!!
4.0,"Amazing place for north Indian food. Went here on a weekday and got a table easily, but then realised that there's waiting on weekdays also. We ordered the paneer handi sabzi, stuffed kulcha and veg pulao with a few nimbu paanis. The stuffed kulcha is the best I've had. Reasonably priced as well. One drawback of the place is they have no AC, which causes too much suffocation with all the hot food."
4.5,Awesome north Indian food!  Nawabii paneer is a must try with basket of Roti's.  Ambience is good on first floor with an environment of village and like sitting in a dhaabha.
3.0,"As the name suggests, it is a restaurant with village like ambience. I visited this place for a family dinner. Ambience and service, considering the peak hours as well, both were up to the mark. As far as main course is concerned, the food was a total disaster. We ordered dal makhni, dum aloo, paneer butter masala, methi malai mutter, and breads. Except dal makhni, methi malai mutter, and breads, the rest of the two main course dishes were a total disaster. So, if you are visiting this restaurant, then try only the dishes recommended by people."
4.0,love love love the food here! . afgani kaju panneer is superlative . nawabi panneer is another well made item. baingan bharta and the parathas. omg heaven. solid comeback soon
4.5,"As the name suggests, this is a village theme restaurant, situated in the heart of Kormangala. I was in a mood to eat 'Shuddh Desi Khana', and hence ganged up with few friends and went to this place.  We immediately got a place but if you go late, you might have to wait for a seat.  The ambience is very realistic and close to a village. The walls look as if they are made of mud, although they are not.   As said above, they serve pure vegetarian food. We ordered Palak paneer, Veg Seekh kabab, Bhindi masala, Dal fry and Roti. All of it were tasty and wasn't insanely oily too. We ordered drinks also, Aam panna, Jaljeera, Masala Soda. They prepared it really well.  Service was really fast. Staff is good.  Food is very reasonably priced, not costly at all.  Happy Eating :)"
5.0,"After amazing movie, awesome dinner with friends, no doubt authentic north Indian food. No words. Food or drinks anything is really good. Worth a try"
3.5,My visit with Tashi Bhutia to this venue. Different experience loved Dabba veg. Medium spicy and good service. 500 for 2 is higher on the price they have added value to the location.
4.0,"If you are a vegetarian, this is your spot. Great north Indian food in those big thaali(plates), feels great. Quite reasonable prices. Fried bhindi(okra)( I don't remember the dish name, but it's a starter) is a must try. You'll enjoy the time over there... Enjoy"
4.0,A very good North Indian restaurant in Bangalore. Their setup is really great and food is very spicy. I loved the decoration. The seats are really uncomfortable but otherwise its a good place to have vegetarian dishes.
3.5,"First of all, table reservation is highly recommended. This place is heaven for vegetarians. The interior feel is like village. I feel a little cramped from inside because of the low height.  Talking about the food, as soon as we were accommodated, there came our first order Aampanna"" served in a copper glass. In the main course we had Gramin Veg with Tawa Phulka and Missi roti. The portions are large enough for two people. Spice level varies as per the dish.  The service is really good, the waiters are friendly."
3.5,Good place if you are a veggie. We had come here for team lunch as 10/11 people were vegetarians in my team. The vessels in which they serve are pretty cool with that copper lining other than that I didn't find anything great to review about.
4.0,"Whenever we are on shopping spree near Forum, this is THE destination for a quick yet cheap bite. This place is always crowded but very well managed. Food is really good, and very much within budget. Ambience is also very good. They serve real quick :)"
4.0,"This place is in the Raheja Arcade on the ground floor. One of the best vegetarian restaurants in Bangalore. My brother and I were famished , wanted to eat that filled our tummies and tried their thali. The thali contained 4 phulkas, dal, dry subji, gravy subji, raita and a dessert. I must say all the items in the thali were mouth-watering. The dry aloo-bhindi ki subji is my favourite. A thali that satiates one's hunger for lip smacking food.  Budget for two - 600 Rs"
4.5,"We wanted to visit California Pizza Kitchen last Sunday and gorge on the super fattening Pizzas but unfortunately CPK Koramangla branch was closed.We strolled back and forth in search of a new restaurant but couldn't finalize anything in particular.Finally,our old favorite 'Gramin' came to the rescue and salvaged our sinking hopes.Though we couldn't have Pizzas,we relished what we ordered.  We stuck to the basics by ordering Dal Makhani,Kadhai Panneer with plain chapattis.To be noted:we have grown immensely fond of the Ghee Fulkas they have.They were the softest I have had in Bangalore so far.We have been to this place twice and love it more each time.They even have refreshing beverages.You should try the Pudina shake here for you would most likely find it rejuvenating after a long day.Also loved the Thandai and Anjeer shake.  4.5 stars to Gramin for the hospitality and great taste !                                                                 letshavesupper.wordpress.com"
5.0,"Desi ambience. Desi Music. Desi food, served in copper plates n copper glasses. Wow.. Desi price too.  Do not forget to try Nimbu Ki Shikanji."
4.5,Thr food here is really very good at a very less cost. It is typical traditional north Indian style food and the ambience also reflects the same.
4.0,"As usual, you have to wait to get into the restaurant, but you can order while you wait and the food will be served in no time while you settle down on the table.  Atmosphere is great, specially if you like old Hindi songs during dinner. Food is good as always and value for money too. Never miss to order Pudina Khatta Meetha.  Bon appetit..!!"
4.5,"A perfect restaurant for full course North Indian meal. Good ambiance , enough space even if you go in groups. Loved their Aam Panna"
4.0,I am a vegetarian and this is the place for me to go with my family. Cheap good vegetarian food. I loved this place. I loved the dcor very village like. The food turned out a tad bit spicy otherwise a great place.
3.5,This is a good option for veggies who are looking for easy on the pocket north Indian food in koramangala ...this place has a rustic look to it and some seats can be really uncomfortable but the food that they serve is really simple and fresh ..for some people who can't handle spicy some of the items on the menu can be a challenge ...cheers
4.0,Nice fulfilling vegetarian food...good rotis which is not so common in Bangalore...bit cramped up...but food compensate for the space...long waiting time
4.0,"A nice place for an occasional visit. The whole setup and the ambience is very good. They have a decent variety of dishes and the taste was pretty good, a little spicy though. Might not be a good place for summers as it lacks air conditioning. Table reservation is highly recommended and finding a parking spot was exhausting. Starters stand out in taste compared to the main course. Overall is worth the money paid....!"
4.5,Restaurant has very good ambiance and tasty dishes. Getting the seat on weekends ll b a tuff job since it is crowded heavily. Prices are affordable.
4.5,"Quick service ,  delicious food and courteous staff. The Hara Bara Kabab is excellent ! The gravy was not too oily. Aloo Paratha was to die for"
4.0,"Gramin is located in Raheja Arcade in Koramangala 7th Block right in front of Burger King. First of all, table reservation is highly recommended if possible because the rush is way too much. Next, the moment you enter it feels as if you have been teleported to a whole new world altogether. With bright yellow lights at every corner possible and with a theme that screams of a village and olden days, Gramin for sure is going to bring a smile to your face accompanied with amazement. You notice one thing when you enter is that the height is a little low, so tall people might have to watch out. It has two floors and is abuzz with people everywhere. It did feel a little cramped from inside because of the low height but I guess the fans in every direction possible compensate for that. So, we ordered Babycorn Masaledaar and Lahsooni Paneer Dhuadaar for starters and Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta, Achari Paneer, Methi Paratha, Butter Naan, Butter Chilli Roti, Tawa Roti and Butter Kulcha for main course. Babycorn Masaledaar was cold by the time it came and had lost its crunch. But nevertheless the flavour of corn was there, not so much though. Lahsooni Paneer Dhuadaar was spot on ! The taste of Lahsoon was there, paneer was soft and was truly dhuadaar. Left a spicy sensation in your taste buds after you finished eating it which I loved. Dal Makhani had the makhani texture and taste like it should have and the Achari Paneer was an explosion of flavours. Spicy but, so careful about that. Malai Kofta was the sweet element but a little too sweet, nevertheless good. Methi Paratha was good full of the Methi flavour. Butter Kulcha is a big no. Butter Naan was as usual great. Everybody makes that properly most of the time. Chilli Butter Roti was exactly as the name sounds and Tawa Roti like homemade Rotis. Music was great, just great. Absolutely perfect for the surrounding. The biggest negative apart from all this is that about 98% of the interiors seems to be made of, what looked like wood. That really concerned me a lot. But in the end the food was mostly great, not too pricy and with perfect music and vegetarian friends this place is definitely a go go."
4.0,A good place to have vegetarian North Indian food in Bangalore. Pocket Friendly. The waiters are responsive and quick. Food is more than average.
3.5,"They have deteriorated the taste. The jeera rice had pepper in it, which I felt was a bad touch. The jeera wasn't crunchy as usual. Otherwise, the curries were good. Nice ambience."
4.0,Superb place for veg lovers. Food is yum varieties are there. Service is quite fast. Ambiance is nyc. You will feel like sitting in a modern village. They serve in pure copper utensils dat is quite different. By far I had an awesome experience every time i stepped in. Only thing which is troublesome there is that they don't have the proper parking space. So if you are taking car you might end up spending 10 15 minutes to park the car.
3.5,"For vegetarians lovers this place is a must go! Although they serve north Indian food, but it's different from in taste, presentation and the way they serve in a very good way. Serving in brass coated vessels will definitely take you to rural side of North India which is their theme and they abide by it. Overall food quality and quantity is decent. Must gulkand milkshake and aam panna"
3.5,"Highly populated and hyped vegetarian restaurant in Kormangala. At times it is a never ending wait, but I appreciate the tactics of placing the order while in the waiting queue. The look and feel of this place is purely desi. Talking about the food, as soon as we were accommodated,there came our first order ""Nimbu ki shikanji"" served in a copper glass. It tasted Copper .This was a big No No for me.My taste buds somehow retaliated. Then came the Panner starter that could never go wrong ""Panner kurkure"". It was palatable. Paneer vindaalo was peppery and highly seasoned(I like it that way),it was teamed up with roti. Overall the food was fairly good and reasonably priced, nothing exceptional. For me it is a one time eat :)"
2.5,Would not recommend it yo anyone. Food is not at all special. You can have anywhere this type of food. That too when you have to wait for atleast half an hour to get a table. Seating is also average. Go at your own risk. Only jaljeera was good.
4.5,Gud place fr veg - lovers. Food is really gd. I hav alsoo enjyd d ambience of dis place. Vry nycc nd bful village kinda surroundings dey hav made. Bt if ur visiting dis place on weekends make sure u do d bookings previously bcz dis place is always crowded nd u vl hav to wait a long queue.
3.5,Super crowded on weekends. They either hit or miss on the food. Starters were decent but super spicy. Sabzi was just meh. Dal was delicious though. Overall it was a miss.
1.0,"I've going to this restaurant from2004/ 2005, I believe this was run by a family and they were in news for good. Food is good, but off late they have a very bad attitude when you have to book a table, even if you book in advance they make us sit for a long time for a table. the Fair tall guy who takes the orders is very rude when talking and thinks that this is the only place. I wish we get one more competitor in the same vicinity."
3.5,Good veg restaurant.till know twice had food at this place.loved it.mostly bhindi rajashtani. Curd rice and there thanda selection.best in veg selection.loved the food..must try
3.0,Heard a lot about this places so been there.. Starters were good had makki seekh kabab and paneer kabab. Main course was average dint like the Veg Kolapuri. A drink made with kacha mango was awesome. Should improve the ambience
5.0,"We visited here for a Saturday lunch. As the name suggests, the ambience makes you feel as if you are inside a cottage in the country side. Red brick interiors and rural decorations give it a villagey look. We started with lasooni paneer dhuandar. Paneer served with smoking charcoal. It gives a distinctive taste and smell as if cooked in an earthen stove. To wash it down we had ordered kesar lassi and thandai. Both are quite rich and heavy. Tandoori chat was something to eat again, the pineapple tandoori was so juicy and soft. Main course was Phulkas with Daal and Achaari Paneer followed by Jeera rice!. yummy North Indian food they serve  Being only a vegetarian restaurant with authentic North Indian thali with so many varieties of dishes, you don't miss the non-veg at all. Service and ambience is good."
3.5,"A good place for vegetarian families looking for North Indian food. Well priced and well cooked food. The place is cozy and quite crowded, which may feel a little cramped, but if you arrive early it's quiet and peaceful. The service is really good, the waiters are friendly, and the food arrives quite fast. A special mention to the amazing tomato soup!"
4.5,Good place for vegetarian food at a cheap price. Prompt service as our starter(chatpatta babycorn paneer) which was not upto the mark was replaced quickly with a better and tastier starter. Dal fry and lassi were the best in the meal.Lovely ambience having village like decor.
4.0,"It has a lovely village decor with tasty food to serve with it. The banjara paneer korna was spicy and nice, combining the flavours of pudina and paneer in a lovely way. Gramin kofta was decent enough. The rose lassi was just the perfect way to end the dinner. The only wrinkle was the service took a little bit of time. This place is recommended for tasty North Indian vegetarian cuisine."
2.5,One of the pure vegetarian North Indian style restaurant. The ambience gives you the feeling of village ...one of the average restaurant . We ordered north indian thali ..with the price being charged quantity of food was good ...but the food was too spicy ...it wsnt evn moderate ..so barely cud njy anythn   So people who dnt eat much spicy ..shudnt try thali out there ...
3.5,When my stomach is a bit off that is when I decide to order out for vegetarian food.  Ordered a corn pulav and a curd rice. The pulav is good and the curd rice is made well with cashews and fried curry leaves garnishing on top.  A good place to try out some vegetarian dishes.                                                                  rjheartnsoul.com
2.5,Had gone there for a treat once. There was a lot of crowd for the food. The food wasn't half bad but for me it didn't live up to the expectations I had in mind after the rave reviews people gave it to me. The ambience was as one would expect for the theme. The food was a bit on the expensive side as per me and I would probably not visit it if I was paying for it! There are better options in Koramangla
3.5,"We ordered lassi, masala buttermilk, paneer baby corn jalfrezi sabji, achari paneer sabji, butter naans. The food was really good. The ambience is also in sync with the name of the of the place. The service is also very quick. :)"
3.5,"I like most veg main course items here. Homely atmosphere, ideal for couples and families.  Definitely observe the utensils used that gives you a typical rural ambiance"
2.0,"Visited here on a Sunday afternoon with family. Looking at the waiting status outside and zomato rating, I went  inside with huge expectations. We ordered tomato soup, Afghani Paneer, methi matar malai, different types to rotis and dal takda and the only sweet option they had - gulab jamun. And of course, masala papad with zestless and parched toppings of tomato n onion. I couldn't finish the soup, as I felt it was slate and a great effort was put to curb the staleness by putting lot of black pepper. Rotis were okay, not bad. Methi matar malai and Dal tadka were just below average. Methi matar malai was extremely sweet with sour milk particles in it, but nothing can beat the dal tadka that had just no taste in it, only boiled dal without any tinch of tadka."
2.0,"Gramin is one upscaled pure vegetation place at Raheja Arcade, just next to Punjab grill. So how is it ? Well I couldn't understand why there were sooooooooooo many people who wanted to get in here because food was..... under average. Quantity was way less and prices were ok. Overall it's just over hyped.  Price  7/10 Taste  4/10 Service  7/10 Ambience  6/10 Value for money  5/10 Will I go back  I dont think so"
4.0,"The one thing separates this place from the rest of the restaurants in the surroundings, The Final Bill !  When said that, one can expect a place with lesser quality of food or some mismanagement. But Gramin puts it all behind with nice food and a unique way of being served by the staff. Usually you will find a single person or two serving your table which adds up to the time taken. But, here you can get served by 3-4-5 people at a time which makes a quicker arrival of food at your plate.  One should not miss that crispy Bhindi Rajasthani they server, just awesome ! Try the thanda thanda menu, it has many varieties available all year round. The other food is well prepared and comes hot enough to savor the taste. You will not get disappointed most of the times.  Coming to points of pain, one has to wait long on the busy days. You should well have a look at the Menu outside and order for the food to make sure it comes soon when you are given the table. The waiters are really quick and sometimes it feels irritating as they are trying to finish your food as fast as possible and get the next guests in.  Verdict : 4 stars for the food, as it is nice. And yeah 0.5 star for that small bill. But reducing 0.5 stars for the service and ambiance which has not changed over the years.  It deserves 4 STARS !"
4.0,I had been to this place after a friend of mine recommended it to me.....by looks and ambience it looks very plain....nothing fancy about this restaurant....but what caught my attention was that on a Saturday noon there was queue for ppl waiting to have food here....and man it was one of the best north Indian food I had eaten after I shifted to Bangalore ( north Indian food here is expensive and not worth it)... it is also inexpensive and u get good quantity... just wish they spent some money for the interiors...
4.5,"If you are a pure veggie, this is the place for you as there are plenty of options in the menu which is a rare sight for veg. Also they have Jain foods which doesn't include onions, garlic and cauliflower. Price is bit high but I really love the top class ambience."
4.0,Restaurant is village themed and serves food in copper plates. One of the best places in Koramangala for authentic North Indian veg food. Even the prices are quite reasonable.
3.5,"Definitely a thumbs up for my veggie friends. I'd taken the north Indian thali - simple, clean and yum! Service is up to the mark. The place has a village tint, but is a little bit congested."
5.0,"I've never had better food in Bangalore! This place serves unreasonably tasty food and is light on pocket. I've not been to a restaurant that serves a whole wheat Roti, everyone serves Maida, that also makes it my personal favorite."
4.5,"Nice village - themed ambiance.Visited here for a team lunch recently. Mostly crowded , serves veg only . Typical North Indian items on the menu. Decent food ,ordered for some thalis and some a-la-carte dishes.Advantage - its location, walking distance from forum mall."
3.0,"I throw my b'day party here. We are 13 people booked the table earlier but had to wait for 30 minutes. Food and ambience was good, Service was little bit slow and place was small and congested. Don't try Lassi that one is horrible."
4.5,"We went here for lunch on my cousins birthday. I have been here 4-5 times in past 1 year and I love the food here.  We started with 'thanda' Wer we ordered pudhina katta meeta, lime soda, Masala soda, nimbu ki shikanji and chatka Gobi, afgan kaju paneer, tawa corn peas. Out of which chatka Gobi was tasty, and spicy as suggested in menu and tawa corn was little sour and crispy, only afgan kaju was just satisfactory for Gramin standard. All 'thands' were the BEST. Later we ordered plain roti, babycorn capsicum, gramin kofta. Both gravy were bit spicy but delicious. Later we had gramin biriyani which was just an average nothing special.  My rating according to category Food - 4.8/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 4/5 Price - 4.5/5"
4.5,"Visited Garmin for a friend's farewell. Extremely satisfied with the service provided. The food is really good at a reasonable cost. Spices are in apt proportion. All of us loved the food and the place. The ambience truly gives us the Garmin feel with the types of plates, glasses and seating used along with good Indian music. It is a must-visit for all veggies out there !"
3.0,I was travelling Bangalore for a official purpose and went to this place with some colleagues. We ordered 3 sabjis (curries) and few butter rotis with buttermilk. The curries tasted very average. We ordered two spicy flavours and one mid-spicy. But none of them tasted spicy at all.   The ambience is decent with low height sitting arrangement.  Overall it was a avg experience.
1.0,Pathetic quality food and third class service...use to be really good once upon a time...paneer was hard. Dal makhani was insult on the menu.handi biryani was pulao with biryani masala....raita was even more bakwaas...wasted my money 700 rs...
4.0,Waited for almost 40 min but worth it. Food was like home cooked & tasty; we  thoroughly enjoyed the meal with paneer butter masala with roti;lassi was great
3.0,"Having heard a lot about this place, decided to check it out. It has a rustic feel to it as the name suggests. Old hindi songs in the background with wooden interiors; the ambience is a winner. The food tastes just fine. It was not as good as I had heard or expected it to be. The Rajasthani bhindi for starters is a major rip off. The main course was okay."
4.5,"All time favorite restaurant, just love their food, I used to go here so often that everyone whoever were part of this restaurant used recognize me. Love their starters, main course, desserts and thanda. If you are in a mood to try something different try ""Soda Hari Mirch"". ""Tawa Corn Peas"" is my all time favorite and can finish the entire plate. Their use of spice is simple yet tasty. Have tried most of the items in the menu. All Veggies do not miss this restaurant."
3.0,"After visiting this place twice and having a great experience, went to the place again for lunch with a group of 8 people and it turned out to be 'not so great'. The soup was downright disastrous. Both sweet corn and tomato soup tasted bad. The flavor was too strong with excess pepper. In the starters, the baby corn masaledar served was completely burnt and dry. It had literally no taste. The paneer and aloo starters were pretty good though. For the main course we ordered 4 sabjis, they all tasted pretty good and the breads were all well done. This and the Gramin biriyani were the saving grace for the day. Could have been just a bad day for them. Keeping in mind the past experiences, will surely give them another chance!"
4.0,"Proper desi food, vegetarian food! Looking for something similar, this is your destination. This has to be one of the most delicious veg food I have had in a, really, long time. The most exciting part is the queue that this hotel possess at any given point of time (keeping weekends in mind). The second most exciting part is the plate or thaali they have to serve. It's one freaking huge thaali. You won't call out for a second serve. An average Indian citizen has to have an overburdened gut at the end of the meal. If not, one has to be the Great Khali (pun intended). Try the butter naan people with malai paneer, killer combo.  la carte is available too, choose wisely. A group lunch or dinner is quite a fun. Also don't miss the lassi."
4.0,"Really like this place. Excellent option for north Indian food. Have tried the saag, makai ki roti tomato soup, lehsuni paneer dhuadar, gramin kofta and the lassi. All good.  No complaints except for dirty napkins. Would definitely recommended a visit."
4.0,"We visited here for a Saturday lunch. As the name suggests, the ambience makes you feel as if you are inside a cottage in the country side.

It gives a distinctive taste and smell as if cooked in an earthen stove. To wash it down we had ordered kesar lassi and thandai. Both are quite rich and heavy. One would have been enough for two of us. A distinctive Punjabi touch to the lassi too.  In the main course we had kaju masala with garlic kulchas and naan. The portions are large enough for two people. Spice level varies as per the dish and you can get mild to extreme spicy variety of dishes here.  The service is quick and food is served in copper/bronze plates. Overall loved the experience.  The place gets absolutely crowded on weekends and hence the management is skeptical about reserving a table. But if you are looking for good north Indian vegetarian food without the extravagant prices, congratulations, you are at the right place."
4.0,"Being only a vegetarian restaurant with authentic North Indian thali with so many varieties of dishes, you don't miss the non-veg at all. Service and ambience is good."
4.5,"Delicious food with lightning quick service and a great village ambience. Located at koramangla , next to forum this restaurant is a paradise for veg friendly people. Veg sheekh kabab is one of the good starters. Boondi raita is a must try. Dining there gives you a village-like feel away from the busy streets of bengaluru. Garlic Kulcha is the best bread they have.  My personal favorite in the city. Must visit."
4.0,"Ambience: 4/5 Fully a village type atmosphere..liked it.. Service: 4/5 We remnd in a queue fr  arnd 30mins n tht ws rly pathetic.. but once we entered, appreciable service..

Missi roti ws yukk, not at al good :( Overall a nice exprnce.. Eat & Enjoy :)"
2.0,"After reading all the great reviews and listening to all the appreciation from a few acquaintances, we ended up here, expecting an amazing North Indian dinner at a decent budget, only to be disappointed with something that could be called edible :(  Probably we didn't know what exactly to order, but when a restaurant has such an awesome rating, you would expect everything to be yummy.  No doubt, Gramin exceeds your expectations when it comes to creating the ""Gramin"" feel in terms of the ambience, hitting it spot on and also putting in their best efforts when it comes to providing service, but the food was just a disappointment for us.  We ordered the Chatpata Babycorn Paneer for appetiser. Nothing chatpata about it. It just seemed to have an overdose of pepper, making it spicy, not tangy. There were curry leaves in it, which seemed to shift the flavours to the worse side rather than enhancing it.  Oh and before i forget, the ketchup served with the appetiser, seemed to have light notes of beer in it. Don't know if it was meant to be that way or if the ketchup had fermented, but it was something different. Moving on, we had the Gramin Kofta and Butter Naan for Main Course. The Gramin Kofta was decent enough, not anything great but nothing bad either. The flavours were simple, normal kofta like, nothing special to call it ""Gramin Kofta"""
4.0,"Been to this Pure veg restaurant recently though it was not a first time, each time I visited with different set of people. It is one of the well known only veg restaurant which is serving real gramina food since years!! Village Ambiance was very complementing the food.  As usual we never missed to gulp their Tanda Tanda signature drinks which are Shikanji, Thandai and Aam panha. Tandoori chat was something to eat again, the pineapple tandoori was so juicy and soft. Main course was Phulkas with Daal and Achaari Paneer followed by Jeera rice!. yummy North Indian food they serve  Service was good not like earlier but!  Verdict: Good place for Veggies with Authentic North Indian food complemented by nice village theme and easily locatable location in Koramangala.                                                                 eattravelcapture.wordpress.com"

5.0,"Amazing food, awesome service..... worth the money...really a heaven for vegetarians. Specialities:- 1. Lasooni Paneer Dhuadaar (Smoky Paneer) 2. Paneer da salan. 3. Methi Paratha. 4 Jaljeera/sweet lassi...  I would ask you guys to try this place atleast once and you will agree to my review."
4.0,One of the most known and best ... Worth money .. Old and very reputable ... Nice place and yummy food ... It gives you the feel of North India .. And taste is just like North Indian family kitchen ... Good and beautiful decor ...
3.5,"Nice veg restaurant, I have been there so many times. Decent priced and food is good. Koyla paneer is a must have. Another advantage is its location, a since it's located at raheja arcade- it has a walking distance from forum mall."
4.5,"It has been 4 years since I moved to Bangalore and Gramin has been a staple for me since then. The food is spicy and will cater to your hunger of authentic North Indian food.  Rajasthani bhindi and Dum aloo masaledar are a must try.  Kurkuri/ Rajasthani bhindi is a great starter, it's spicy with a bit of tang and try it with green chutney.  One of the must visit places for all the people who love North Indian food"
4.0,"A place known for its village themed ambiance. The place is really good with seating arrangements so village-ish. The decors on the walls and the paintings is great too. Service is polite and courteous. Now coming to the food, the quality of food is great and its flavours quite delicious. Have lassi too, it is great. Nice experience indeed :)                                                                 eatsandexplores.wordpress.com"
1.5,"Good ambience and efficient staff! Food is below average. Basic paneer, aalu gobhi and bhindi dishes didn't make the markKesar lassi is a decent bet!"
3.0,The food was okey okey but only one thing i felt was missing was ac that place was too hot. And i was sweating badly. Any yes food was costly compared to quantity and quality.
4.0,"* Lovely village - themed ambiance! Mostly crowded and serves only Vegetarian. Ah, it's a delight for us vegetarians! Typical North Indian items on the menu. So you can expect a lot of ghee/butter on your kulchas! It's much on the heavier side so do request beforehand if you're not into ghee and butter, like me. Their Jaljeera was amazing. Food was good as well. Drop in if you're craving for some yummy Parathas and Paneer masalas!"
3.5,Quite crowded during weekends. We had to wait like for 20 minutes for the table. The service is quick and good. Good place to go  for vegetarian food lovers. Good quantity of food.
3.0,"Its a pure veg restaurant Rajasthani style,They created a village like ambiance,   Good food at Good price. Crowd was good, You have to wait on weekends"
3.5,"Do you work in kormangala and need to grab a quick lunch? Well then, this place has to be on your list. Traditionally scrumptious north Indian food in minutes. Simply put good food and good service, check! But quantity is rather less for the cost. If your a poor eater, you have nothing to worry about. Gluttons may have a heart attack when the bill arrives"
5.0,If you are low on budget and vegetarian food is your thing and this place is a must visit. Easy to locate in Raheja Archade Koramangala this place gives you proper North Indian meals. Love the ambiance.
3.0,"Having heard about this place a lot from my cousins, I decided to try it out this Sunday. The ambience was good. Authentic ""gramin"" feel. There was a huge crowd and we had to wait 45 min to get a seat. The best part though was they were taking orders too parallely so you don't have to wait upon your turn. The food was not something extra ordinary. The Gobi masala was too spicy, dal makhani too garlicy and the aam panna was too sweet. The service is good but the food disappointed me having heard about it a lot."
3.5,"Gramin a perfect place for a college students. Very pocket friendly, good taste, hygienic food & fast service. Only the space is very small, but still they manage that good. Good thing is their Thali which has adequate amount of items always full your stomach.  VERY GOOD RESTAURANT !!!!!!!"
3.0,"We visited here for a team lunch recently. We hadnt made a reservation, and the servers at reception didnt seem very interested in getting us a table. Anyway we proceeded to first floor and occupied one of their big tables. They should do something about their noisy fans. We ordered for some thalis and some a-la-carte dishes, some lassis, chaas, chilli soda, salted lime soda, rajasthani bhindi and some babycorn paneer starter. Sodas were just average. Babycorn paneer was not that great. Rajasthani bhindi was excellent though, spiced and fried to perfection. I found my salted lassi too thick, but some of us liked their thick sweet lassi.                                                                 ...Read full post on hungrypandadiaries.wordpress.com"
4.0,"Had plans for another restuarant in JP nagar for dinner but ""Luckily"" it was too crowded :D. And so we landed here (my friend's choice). This one was however no less. They had chairs set outside. The Menu too was available outside.   One has to go register and give their order to the waiter.... again outside.. :D I was actually impressed by their time management and keeping foodie's engaged ... outside. Again lucky for the restaurant .. that there are some make-shift shops selling clothes and accessories which ppl would not bother to have a look. The focus from that long waiting would obviously shift for some of them.  We waited for some 20 min .. all our group finally gathered and went in. It was first time for me and yes again impressed by their space management. We got a table first floor corner. We ordered earlier some Plain Rotis, Stuffed Kulchas and Garlic Kulchas and 3 curries. Kandhari Aloo was decent, Paneer tikka masala much better than most of the other places. A special mention for Bhaingan Bhartha ....! Yummylicious. The Best one probably I have ever tasted till date.   Lassi or Aam Panna obviously should not be missed and of course Dal Tadka plus Jeera rice.  Caution: Anyone planning to visit this place must have an idea of how much they are going to eat and what they are going to eat. You get food served faster if they are ordered well before .... ""Outside"". :D. Any thing else ordered during dinner... U'll suffer for sure... they make you wait a lot... really lot. The next round of Kulchas and rotis took solid 20 min to arrive...   Recommended only for people who like dried Plates and end up licking curries...  Food we had was awesomely spicy and of course they indicate in the menu and they mean it. If you are not one of those spicy food lovers... you might want to talk to the waiter while ordering.   Deserts... The lone guy called Gulab Jamun... yes but do not underestimate this one. They are served hot and really delicious. Only after having them I realized... one guy should do the job in deserts :D."
5.0,A small tidy place with awesome ambience... The food is really really tasty...! Worth the price...!  Its a veg restaurant... But even theose eho crave for non veg will fall in love with this place omce they have the food...!!
5.0,"As the name suggests, this place gives the same ambience and a similar taste as opposed to other who claim d same. Should try tandoori stuffed aloo n green peas pulao.. Hari mirch soda is my favorite..."
2.5,"Gramin has been successful in creating a village like ambiance in the middle of a buzzing metro, however, the flavor and the fragrance of a gramin food is missing. I'd visited this place for a casual dinner and was expecting a typical north Indian flavour, but I was utterly disappointed. Few dishes were just bland and others were too spicy to enjoy. The biggest blunder was the soup which in my opinion was plain veg stock and it lacked the mere essence of a soup. The staff were courteous but the service was slow."
3.5,"A place to choose if you want to have affordable but tasty North Indian veg food..have been there many times....all their gravies of paneer, Chana masala, daal everything is good..portion size is also good and order wisely if only 2 people are going.. Only problem is waiting time...the place is always crowded...however they try their best to manage by taking orders while you are waiting and quickly serve it when you get a table.."
4.0,Garmin one of the best pure veg restaurant to which I have been to. People who complain about veg food being non-spicy should visit here and can have great spicy food here. The Menu has got lot of varieties. The Panner dishes cooked here tastes quite different from the ordinary ones. The 'kesar lassi' served here was my most favorite because of it's taste and consistency.   Ambience: very good Service: Very good (it's really fast) Taste: Very Good.
4.0,Had been to this place with family..starters and really yum ..especially the ladies finger Kurkure..crispy and yummm..parathas were great ..crowd was good ..helping staff..ambience was good..overall a nice place to hangout with family..
3.0,"Usually I get it, it's very busy place on weekends but I went their on Monday the crowd was less and even the service was less  SPEED UP guys on weekdays too...  My hands became dry waiting for the food..."
3.5,A perfect place to relish Vegetarian food with a wide variety of choices... 1 would definitely like the sitting which makes you feel the 'Rural' experience... Don't miss Nibu ki Shikanji after your meal
1.0,"Worst restaurant I have visited in the recent past. We went during weekend and all the food was kept ready. Only when we were ordering they hear in microwave and serve us. No taste and gravy tastes like same in all the curries. We ordered Biryani and they brought us some corn rice. When asked about it, went back and added some vegetables to the dish and served the same again. Horrible experience we had and nothing tastes good. Even the starters were pre-heated and served."
4.0,"A Good vegetarian Hotel with Nice ambiance. very traditional ,the seating part personally loved it with the low floor types. Food was sooo yummyyy.. had great varieties"
3.5,A pure veg restaurant will simple and well thought of decor. Located in raheja arcade right next to Punjab grill. The food is quite delightful and pricing is on point. The issue I had is with the seating which would be a little uncomfortable for heavy personalities.
4.0,We went here for a weekend lunch with family of 4. Deewan  handi paneer sabji was v good while malai kofta was ok-ish. Garlic kulcha and Nan were both v crisp. The village feel is nice but really needs an AC In this weather..  Food quality 4 on 5 Ambience 4 on 5 Service time/quality 5 on 5 Price range/value 5 on 5  Will recommend this place
2.5,Been there two times.. Both the time the experience was not good. Veg curries are too much spicy and that not tasty. One expects better taste at this price. Servicing was okay. Ambience was also okay. I find it over hyped.
4.0,"Had been to gramin a couple of days back. A very nice place if you are looking for veg food. The location is decent enough but it has parking problems. We tried the tandoor paneer platter for the starter. It was good, soft paneer , and medium spicy. For main course we ordered gramin kofta, which was slightly sweet with raisins(which I personally don't like) and phulkas. And ended our meal with jeera rice. It was good. We also ordered shikanji and masala soda for drinks. Which was good too. All in all a nice place for veg food."
3.5,"I am a pure vegetarian and I love those restaurants offering only veg food. I was recommended this restaurant by my friends in Bangalore and decided to try this place.  Pros: 1. Taste 4/5 2. Quality 4/5 3. Ambiance 4/5 4. Value for money 4/5  Cons: 1. Seating Arrangement 2.5/5 2. Service 2/5 (I don't know what happened but the service was very slow) 3. Very much congested and crowded  They took our order while we were waiting, but later when we added some items to the order, our order got very much delayed. Overall a good experience, it is just that there was too much rush! Would visit this place again on a weekday during lunch and try their thali."
5.0,"Wonderful experience at Gramin Ambience: 4/5 Well though little crowdy , the village ambience has been well maintained  Food: 5/5 After a very long time I finally ate something in Indian food that was a wow. New taste.  Service: 5/5 It's quick. And while we are waiting, they would take orders outside as well so that they can serve when we get the table. Saves everybody's time  Cost: 5/5 Very value for money  Parking: * Well they are part of raheja arcade so can't provide a separate parking for the restaurant."
4.0,"Lovely ambience with great food at great prices. We ordered Aam panna which tasted heavenly in summers and nimbu shikanji which was not that great.  Had phulka , dal and aloo Gobi. Good blend of masala though they could have cooked aloo Gobi a little less than what they did.   They have a huge waiting crowd so one should pre-plan."
1.0,Unnecessarily Over hyped! Doesn't even know the basics of North Indian food! It is a restaurant which doesn't serve water unless asked for. Pathetic taste for even the simplest and most common dishes.
4.0,"Beautiful set-up inside with a lovely village like ambiance and decor. The seating is pretty colorful and is in two floors. Unlike the other similar outlets with a thali concept alone, this place does ala-carte. They do serve Thali but only during the Lunch and that too for a way reasonable price as compared to others. The menu is interestingly done as well. Taste- hands down, really good. The North-Indian varieties are really good and delights each time I have had here. The staff and service both really good and quick too. The place is quite popular and mostly crowded, often seen is a long queue outside, but all worth the wait indeed. Highly recommend for a nice village theme dining."
4.0,"What took me so long to write a review about this wonderful, wonderful place. Garmin is one of my very first restaurants in Bangalore and I absolutely love the North Indian food they serve. Have been here more than a couple of times and so my list of favorites is long. Lassi, karari bhindi, kadai Paneer, Kulchas, Kofta, Paneer Tikka and jaljeera are some of my staples here. Recently they renovated the entire place and made it more spacious. So no more long queues, yeah but short queues are still there. :) :p Pocket pinch: not much, but worth it. 500-800 for two."
4.0,"Have been to this place more than once before.  I really  like how they have created their ambience  in such a small place. Recently  we ordered  veg soup and their north indian thali.  The soup was really  thick and good.  Even the thali was really  yum.  It would  fill you up perfectly and is worth it.  If you plan  to visit this place,  must try their thali."
4.0,Been there on a Sunday afternoon. Have to wait for 15 mins but everything I have got once I stepped in was worth the wait. Ambience is nice giving a feel but important thing was food and it was at par. Wonderful set of varieties. Food was delicious service was also good. Only downside was waiting time for main course but taste of the food covered that. All in all a wonderful place to dine and socialise.
3.5,Nice lil place.. Its bit a clumpsy but food vl make it up fo it.. Good food good service..Sweet Lassi was great..  Food - 3.5/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 3/5
4.0,Yummy vegetarian food! The starters are really good and spicy..tried the thali and had other stuff a couple of times and loved every bit
4.5,"Best place for north indian veg food. Always crowded in weekends. But the food the ambience everything is nice. Specially there pineapple riata is very nice. Everything i ordered was nice. Whenever i am in kormangla and want to have north indian then this is the place. When i went this time i tried aam panna which is amazing and kerela kawab u wont feel you are having kerela when you have it, really nice.Ankush Miglani foodtravelpedia.wordpress.com"
3.0,"Had thali here for lunch, Roti was gud but the quantity of rice is very less.. Just a cup of rice wont help for a lunch !! well designed outlet though."
5.0,"Best north Indian veg food in the area. Cheap and good ambience, courteous servers, amazing taste. Pick anything from the menu and it'll definitely taste good."
3.5,"Gramin.. it means style of  old, village orinented.. gramina bharata... This restaurant is located near to forum mall kormangala.. I have visited this place many times.. and experienced different food prepared by them.. Most tried is dry pepper bhandi fry.. which is hmmmmm... They basically serve north indian food in traditional way.. and present in copper vessels.. Ambience is different is like village oriented.. Rates are normal..  Enjoy your foood sandeepkasal.wordpress.com"
4.0,"Perfect place if you're looking for good veg food, they also have a menu for the main community. Their price is very reasonable and quantity is perfect as well. I'd suggest the veg sheekh kabab for appetisers, the jaljeera for beverages, the gramin biryani or the paneer kheema lilac for rice. The gravies are really good. Try something with the paneer and kaju. The ambience is of an old school dhaba somewhere in Punjab, and they serve the food in steel plates gives you the feel of grandmas rotis. Great place for a family meal."
3.5,"I visited Gramin with my cousins. It is a pure vegetarian place. As it was Saturday evening, the place as expected was crowded and had to wait for half an hour to get a table. We had kadai paneer and dal fry with tawa rotis. The rotis were not hot and crisp as you would expect them to be. Maybe the crowd decreased the quality of the service. The sabji was good and we also had lassis that was nice. Overall, a good place to try if you are in mood for North Indian vegetarian food..."
4.5,"This place will never disappoint you! Visited many a times..   Cheap and best rule works here.. Yummy food   Very humble staff... Drinks are ""wowsome"" Be its buttermilk, lassi,   A thumbs up"
3.0,"I stumbled across Gramin in zomato and decided to pay it a visit because of the great reviews.  We ordered fried bhindis for starters; gramin koftas, dal makhani and fulkas constituted the main course. The food was too spicy for our palate. Even after we requested a tone down of spice level in dal makhani, we couldn't manage to finish the dish. I will the rate the food to be average at the best.  In terms of service and hospitality, the restaurant would score full marks. However, the food was a bit of a let down."
3.5,A pure veg restaurant located in koramangla. This place gives you the feel of a royal Indian dinning room. Along with this it also serves great food through service that is also wonderful. Great ambiance and friendly staff.
4.0,A good place for non vegetarians on diet. The thali meals have good variety and quantity. It is also a nice place for lunch on fridays. will surely recommend to friends and family.
4.0,"Almost every dish was well done and tasted great. Especially a bitter gourd starter which we ordered multiple times. Makai roti, saag etc was pretty good too. Overall, awesome place. Vfm Highly recommended"
3.5,"Been visiting this restaurant since 5 years, from decor to taste all are minimal and consistent. I have generally visited during lunch time. Thali is ok, al carta is better. Getting seats in noon time is quite difficult, better to book before."
5.0,Good ambience. Went in for an early dinner post a tiring day to release the days frustration. . Perfect dining with great food. . pretty good rates too. . Amazing phulke with dum aloo.. jus a perfect end for the day..
4.0,"When you want to eat good authentic North Indian food, Gramin is the go to place. Love the ambiance. The staff is cordial and give good service. Coming to the food, the main course and starters are great. All of them are worth a try. In beverages the shikanji and lassi are tasty. Have been here with family or friends and it's always been a good experience."
2.5,"Just came back from a dinner at this place and must say this is purely an over hyped place. Being from north side of India we entered this place with great expectation just to regret our choice later. What all we ate: Jaljeera, Shikanji, Masala Papas, Rajasthani Bhindi Fry, PaneerTikka, Kadhi Kofta, Grameen Paneer, Roti Basket and Phirki Parantha. We were heartily disapponited with the food, seemed as if it was to much of a spice riot especially the bhindi; though crispy it was showered with extra layers of chaat masala making it to khatta to eat (we left the bowl as it was), in kadhi kofta though kofta's were dipped in gravy yet they were too hard to bite. Also, both curries seemed to taste the same. Only plus point of this place was its service and staff they are really prompt with service and knew how to handle the crowd.  Readers you may want to give this place a miss."
4.5,Good traditional ambience and food is served in copper plates and tumblers. Many times you end up waiting in the queue unless reserved in advance. One of the rare things that happens here compared to other indian restaurants is they take order from you when waiting in the queue to save time. You get only vegetarian food here. My usual selection here is thaali which is quite sumptious. This is located inside raheja arcade.
4.0,"If you want to taste authentic North Indian dishes which tastes closest to home cooked food, Gramin is the place to go. Went for the 5th time yesterday with my friend and the food was delicious. We Ordered a mix veg soup, paneer starter, masala papad. Had paneer bhurji and dal fry for main course. And ended with an as usual amazing masala chaas.. Will keep visiting. The price is very reasonable for the quality.. Ambience is good too, but if you're looking for some privacy or fine dining  this is not the place to go. It is most of the time crowded.. Btw it's a pure veg restaurant, they don't serve even egg."
3.5,"Best place to have pure-veg food in Koramangala, Bangalore. Very Good quality & taste but high on ""butter"". It is no way a compromise for those who can't eat non-veg."
3.0,"Used to be good once upon a time, not so anymore.  We visited here for a team lunch recently. We hadn't made a reservation, and the servers at reception didn't seem very interested in getting us a table. Anyway we proceeded to first floor and occupied one of their big tables. They should do something about their noisy fans.  We ordered for some thalis and some a-la-carte dishes, some lassis, chaas, chilli soda, salted lime soda, rajasthani bhindi and some babycorn paneer starter. Sodas were just average. Babycorn paneer was not that great. Rajasthani bhindi was excellent though, spiced and fried to perfection. I found my salted lassi too thick, but some of us liked their thick sweet lassi. Main course was average at best. I didn't like the dal makhni much, it has probably too much tomato in it. Paneer was too spicy, unfortunately I can't recall the name now. Malai kofta was not done well. Koftas were a little hard and gravy had too many lumps.  Apart from their rajasthani bhindi, I didn't really like anything here.                                             hungrypandadiaries.wordpress.com"
3.0,"First off, loved the seating arrangement and the ambience they have created there. It really felt like Gramin. There were 90's songs playing in the background reminding me of my childhood. The Pudena khatta meetha was a great starting drink. But they do need to improve on the rest of them.  The basket of Roti's offered us with different varieties, each with its own unique taste. They were crisp and fresh. The subzi's on the other hand were below expectations. We ordered Kandhari Aloo which which wasn't cooked well and still felt raw. Also the Handi Paneer Masala seemed tasteless."
4.0,"Been here with my friends for lunch. The ambience is pretty good, like a contemporary village house.. Coming to food.. Karari bhindi was awesome, paneer sabzi was good as the paneer was fresh n the drinks ( gulkand milkshake and a minty drink) were really refreshing.. Service was good.. The manager suggested us the drinks which turned out to be nice !!! Would visit again for sure and would suggest everyone to give it a try!!"
5.0,"They serve one of the best vegetarian thaali in Bangalore. Loved every piece of the meal and the taste still remains in the tongue, yearning to have it once again. The ambiance is very good, well decorated and clean interiors. Service is one important factor that lacks in most restaurants in Bangalore,most of my visiting Mumbai friends complain and even I agree to some extent, but Gramin has a good cordial staff. The overall experience was excellent. Thanks Gramin!"
3.5,"This is an awesome place to eat vegetarian food. We went with a group of food and ordered a great deal of food and paid only 200rs each, which was a shock for us as the quality and quantity of the food was super. Later on I took my mom there as I loved the food, and she absolutely diged into the food.                                                                 keepitstylishdayita.com"
3.5,"I'll keep it short and simple good food, great ambience and amazing service. This is a pure veg restaurant completely Indian restaurant and has an authentic taste to it."
4.5,"one of my favorite place for north indian food. The ambiance, the plates and glasses (copper made), the decors and the music, will take you to a north indian village. Almost have tried all their food and all are awesome. The place gets crowded on weekends and has some waiting period to get your table. The service is real good and quality of the food is top class. By the time when you read the names of their recipe, it makes you salivate. Lassi and Gulkhand milk shakes are super good."
3.5,"You may have to wait for a table on weekends but they take your order outside itself, so you won't have to wait inside a lot. Within minutes of being seated, the starters arrive. Had the Rajasthani bhindi, but it was over-fried. In main course we had the gramin kofta and gramin paneer. Kofta was spicy while the paneer was a bit sweet. Pineapple raita was a bit disappointing, which felt like pineapples chopped into the sweet lassi. Decent place for north indian dinner."
3.5,"The long queues outside Gramin on the weekends is not an unfamiliar sight. We had to wait a good 20mins before we could be seated inside. Though a hardcore non vegetarian, I decided to try out the hyped vegetarian food the place had to offer. The ambience was rustic and charming.The pre ordering of food helps in early arrival. The navrantana korma ordered was good along with roti and jeera rice. The nimbu ki shikanji was refreshing on a hot summer day. The taste of the food is actually not bad. One upside is their claim of using zero food preservatives in their meals. The seating adjustments could do with some changes to make it more comfortable. A fine choice for a vegetarian meal if you are willing to wait for your turn at the tables."
4.0,It's rare to find good quality taste and ambience !! Guess what we found one that is gramin !!  Oh ya reasonable too ! We are looking for more outlets in Bangalore :)
3.5,"The place has a very cozy ambience, almost homely.  Food wise, they've got a section in their menu called diet subzi, so you can actually go there and eat healthy. Oh, and almost everything they make with bhindi is fantastic! The other food is also fairly decent, not excellent.  The service is EXCELLENT. We had waiters by our table to ask us about the food as well as serve our food almost the entire time. It's definitely good to have a peaceful family time there Oh, and if you like old Hindi songs, the classics, you will love the soft music playing in the background!"
4.0,A really nice place situated near Forum Mall.  No parking place around  at peak times (cons).  Really enjoyed the food here and pretty spicy too if you like it like that!  And the bill comes up to a smaller amount that expected !  Would love to visit this once in a while!
4.0,We have visited this restaurant twice both time there was a long queue so we waited for sumtime but the food was tasty so it compensates for the waiting time. Must visit for vegetarians. Absolutely pocket friendly. In the starters we tried chatpata baby corn pane er and lassoni paneer dhudhadar both were nice. Main course was also good. Overall loved it.
4.5,"Located in the most coveted area of Koramangala ""Gramin"" is an enticing place for vegetarians. The ambiance is themed on a rural surrounding suiting the name. The hospitality managers of the restaurant keep a track of the empty tables and the orders in an amazingly efficient manner. The starters specially ""Tawa Paneer"" sets the stage for the delicious journey of food served in this restaurant. Main course has plethora of varieties consisting of succulent paneer curries as well as various other mouth watering curries. The ""Pineapple Raita"" and ""Masala papad"" are the most sought after dishes here. I would recommend ""Gramin"" to anyone who wishes to dig his taste buds in multiple vegetarian delicacies."
3.5,Good food but no air conditioning...try stuffed aloo for starters....thali is decent but if ur really  hungry u would need some extras...kesari lassi gives the soothing finish
4.5,"The minute you enter this place, you are surrounded by a calm and soothing environment. The ambiance of the restaurant makes you feel at home and the service is quite remarkable as well. During my visit to this place I tried their Kadai paneer and Veg sheikh kabab. I had never tried veg kababs before and after having a taste of it at this place, I am pretty sure I won't hesitate even for a minute to order it again on my next visit. Anyone who is looking to have a peaceful time and a hearty meal, well, your search should end here."
3.5,"Its one of those lesser places in Bangalore which serve vegetarian food only. The name justifies its ambiance and has a pleasant feel to it.   I was quite disappointed with the food. Being a pure vegetarian, I expect that if a restaurant is 'Vegetarian Only', it should specialize in it. The menu has variety but lacks good taste. We had bhindi Rajasthani, malai seekh kebab and tomato soup in starters, first of which you should definitely try because its a rare delight in Bangalore. The remaining two were nothing special. The curries we ordered lacked spices in them but the Dal fry was tasteful. Butter milk was good. Their service is really slow. We waited for the starters for a long time, then we waited for the main course in spite of ordering it before having our starters. Waiting for the main course after you've warmed up your appetite with the starters is a mood breaker. Overall, a pocket friendly restaurant with a pleasant ambiance, poor service quality and average tasting food."
4.0,"Good authentic food. Must try is Rajasthani bhindi there, with its Crispy chatpata flavour. Nice ambience and ok service. So overall 4 points."
4.5,It is a very nice place for authentic North Indian dishes ...I really loved the thali and price ranging is also quite reasonable.....So you can enjoy your food
3.0,Average food Decent ambience Service is good and so is its location  For a change Gramin is a fine dine. Please do not order something u r not sure about.
4.0,Really good vegetarian food at reasonable prices. We had the regular rotis and sabzis and it did not disappoint. The only bummer is that you might need to wait for a while to get a table. The silver lining is that you can place your order while you wait. My wife is a big fan of the Jal Jeera they serve here.  Quick Review: Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Hygiene: 4/5 Ease of Parking: 2.5/5 Ease of Getting a Table Allotted: 2/5
3.0,Gramin is located in Raheja Arcade just behind Punjab Grill. they serve North Indian veg Cuisines which will remember You of Ghar ka khana. I love their Sarson ka saag and Ghee Phulka. It is a pocket friendly Restaurant. They doesn't have parking space so that is a big disadvantage and that is the reason i will not recommend it. Overall nice place to dine in.
3.5,"Dinner with friends , about 20+ of us, on New Year day. When we called for reservations, they asked us to arrive early like 645 pm. And boy we're happy we listened, the lines were long by 730.  Well lit interiors, but felt cramped with too many tables. They were about to put the children at the same table with us and give away that table to another patron, but we didn't let it happen.   Appetizers were excellent - we had bhini Rajasthani, tawa karela and banana sheekh kabab.  Loved the lightly sweet but thick lassi. Jaljeera was huge quantity, so sins friends shared. Baingan bhartha, kofta  were good and so was  paneer sabji for kids. All breads well done. Gramin biriyani was s good surprise, green but pleasing.  Overall great food."
5.0,"I am a hardcore NON-VEGETARIAN yet I will KILL for their VEGETARIAN food.  Says it all doesn't it? Who knew ghas phus could taste heaven too.   Also if you take your parents, you'll get brownie points as it has this rustic ambience."
4.0,It happens to be one of the popular restaurants in Kormangla located on the main road in Raheja Arcade. Generally crowded on weekends this pure veg restaurant has a theme as the name suggest (village/gramin). The food is very tasty and the staff are friendly too! You must try their Masala buttermilk which is my personal favourite. I have been there numerous times and the experience only gets better each time. You can't sit and eat for too long considering the amount of people waiting to get a table. They don't really reserve so it's first come first served basis. It's not too expensive compared to other similar places in the locality. Overall great food good ambiance and polite staff! :)
3.0,"Gramin is a good place when you order al-a-cart and not a very good place when u opt for thaali.  I am not saying it's bad but isn't consistently good. the reason is simple...when cooking portions are more, the taste factor tends to take a beating.  the starters are good as well as their curries.  they have a very good aam panna. Parking here is always a problem. Service however is very good and comes with a smile."
3.5,"Food is good. But place is small so there is lot of waiting. Also it's not very conspicuous, bit hidden. Absolutely pocket friendly. Nice place for Desi food."
5.0,"Gramin is a place to be to try best Vegetarian North Indian food... We have been going there since a decade now.. :D return home with the contended tummy and a Ear to Ear Smile every time.. Each dish that is served has a fabulous taste and story of its own.. Tawa Karela, Tawa Bhindi and Tawa Corn Peas... lip smackingly tasty..."
4.0,"In Bangalore I am always in search of a good Veggie friendly restaurants which are expert in north indian cuisines , my search comes to an end 1 month back when i tried this place and now this is 1 of my favorite place in Koramangala. The reason is quiet obvious , it is veg only restaurant,large variety of north Indian cuisines, and the ambiance in very nice. Ambiance gives a feeling of a small Indian hut. The food quality is very good and tasty also. I tried lot of dishes and liked all of it. As per service they are little slow in delivery once you order you have to wait for at least 20-30 minutes . But if you are a real foody then its worthy. I strongly recommend to try it at least one time."
4.0,"Visited this place number of times in past 8 years pure veg ,  yummy north indian food ,  best part is they don't use any artificial colours in the food ,  nimbu shikanji is outstanding"
4.0,"A nice pure veg restaurant in koramangala.  Good Ambience, good food and good service. Good experience. Worth a visit. Special mention for the paneer dishes."
3.5,I like the THALI which u get here. Pocket friendly and stomach filling. As it pure veg we visit here rarely. But taste of the food is good. Ambience and service is also very nice
4.0,"Such food much wow. My long lasting craving for baigan ka Bharta had finally come to an end.Thanks to Gramin! . So much love to the people there , great North Indian food and to top it up , fully vegetarian. Went with a bunch of friends to this place located in Raheja Arcade and after so long found a restaurant that could cater to something very close to ghar ka khana . The flavors were great and so was the service. The decor is simple and created to give an authentic village look. Will surely visit it again !"
2.5,"A good Theme coupled with Service with recommendations. Unfortunately the food dint tickle the taste buds, so you can try other places in the vicinity over this.  I personally feel very bad to give a bad review for food as good food really motivates me and this place was a bad experience for food.  Avoid Paneer Handi (hardly any paneer seen in it and the claim its made like this only) Ended Laughing after that comment ""Its made like this only"".  Thandai was Very Good without a doubt.  But Masala Papad was again below avg.  Overall:-   Food: 2 on 5 (Bad experience, worst is when your opinion not considered)  Ambience: 4 on 5 (Village feel and Warm - It was good)   Service: 3.5. on 5 ( This was decemt )   Price: 3.0 on 5 (Moderately High, Bad Experience)   Location: 4 on 5 (Easily Spotable at Kormangala)"
4.5,"Gramin is a wonderful place serving homely, authentic, affordable north Indian cuisine..my first choice to order take out or even go to the restaurant.. I absolutely love their methi parathas and paneer butter masala.. Their north Indian thali is really worth it and delicious. Rose lassi is also one of my favorite. The normal sweet lassi is to die for. The ambiance is lovely with old Hindi music . It just gives you an amazing feel . Quick service and delicious food. Definitely this is the place for anyone to grab a quick lunch which is of great taste and fast service.."
4.5,The restaurant is village-themed and their prices are reasonable. 'Lassi' is a must try! It can definitely fulfill your craving for 'veg food'.
3.0,"A decent village themed reataurant in one of the crowded place in koramangala. Been here just once and tried Soup and complete meal including Dal, paneer curry, naan.  The corn soup was too bland and i had to return it as you dont make corn soup the way they prepared it. Everything else was fine and no complaints on food.  Recommended for vegetarians looking out for north indian food in koramangala. Cheers!!"
4.5,"Gramin is a pure vegetarian restaurant that emulates a peculiar village style-like interior with copper cutlery and classic 70's and 80's Hindi music. Its been here for quite some time now, bagging the times food award, and awards from Zomato and Cleartrip too. Clearly, Gramin is a peoples choice restaurant and their prices are amazing too. All their dishes are amazing but I recommend the 'Punjabi paneer', 'Gramin Veg', and the Lassi. Table booking is recommended though. Its almost impossible to get a free table on immediate arrival."
3.5,"Gramin means 'of the rural people' and as the name suggest this is a village themed restaurant, located in the quite known landmark building, the Raheja arcade in Koramangla. It is one the better vegetarian restaurants in this part of the city and quite popular. I must say I was quite impressed with the flavours of the food and the style of cooking at this place. Those who have experienced rural dining, will be able comprehend the cutlery and the utensils in which the food is served.  The ambience is a little congested (more authentic) but slightly inconvenient.  Food is pretty good. For those who like spicy food, do try the nawabi paneer. And don't miss out on finishing your meal with a towering quantity of Jal jeera! :D  Ambience 3.5/5 Food 4/5 Service 3/5"
4.5,"As a South Indian, I have always been the first person to go to any restaurant with even the slightest hint of kulcha, paneer or gobi in it. And when you finally find your true food love, you just don't want to leave it. One such place happened to be Gramin. I have already been there twice and still can't just get enough of it. With the right blend of rustic interiors and traditional touch, this place truly imitates the authentic decor. The staff is very friendly and the place, although slightly cramped, does seem spacious due to the other plus points. Coming to food, baby corn masaledar and Gramin kofta were my favourites. The quantity given is good and quite a delicacy. Their phirki kulcha a definite must-try, with its right amount of softness and tangy taste. If your budget is low and you want to treat yourself and your friends or family with some authentic veg north indian, then this place is the most suitable. Love the food! Love the ambience more!"
4.0,"Gramin. Based on village theme, pure veg restaurant..  theme wise can be improved a lot but food taste hi too awsm.. and very reasonable..  The best thing is cold water in their bronze glass. Very soothing.."
3.0,"Gramin's used to be quite a popular place once upon a time, one of my fav's too. But with time, I think their food has deteriorated. The customer service is still good but the food aint that great anymore. It is just another North Indian restaurant. Nothing wow about this. The price is quite reasonable though. And this place has quite a few jain options as well."
3.5,"So this was my 2nd visit to this place. We ordered Dal Makhni, Paneer Handi, Shikanji and Gulkand Lassi. The preparations were decent and reasonably priced. Although they have increased their prices. But one of the few good places to get North Indian vegetarian food in Bangalore. Mohamed Zeeshan"
4.0,"Nice place to have nice homely food at low cost but sometimes long wait..I visited more than 10 times but luckily never strucked with long queue for what my others frds are so habituated...nice food ,quick service.bhindi fry , hand briyani,dum aloo all are nice ...thalis are also nice..."
3.5,"Okay, I like the decor, even though it's slightly cramped. The food is good! Really liked a pander dish we ordered, however the Dal was not good AT ALL. Overall, it was average. I've been here before, and the food isn't what it used to be."
4.0,"Wanna experience local village way of Fooding? Gramin will take you to your childhood memories. Loved the ambience.  I loved the antique way they have their plates and glasses. Food and service needs to be improved. You can relax from the heavy traffic outside, make yourself ready for the food as they may take a while to serve."
4.0,"When we(2 of us) entered this place, we were greeted by a person there with a smile who then escorted us to the table(this forms a very important part of hospitality for me - the way you welcome your guests, it makes you feel more connected to the place - full marks here for this) As the name-Gramin(Gram means village in Hindi, thus Gramin is a village person) suggests, the ambiance is themed to be of a village. From the vessels they serve to the wall hangings and paintings, everything is trying to give you a feel of some village. All the utensils(spoons, plate, glass everything) in use are made of copper - again matching to the theme.  Coming to the food part - food is definitely good here but I think there is scope for improving it more in terms of taste. We ordered one Paneer dish and chapatis(point to note - this is pure veg restaurent) We also ordered Pudina khatta meetha which was really a good drink to have with food.  ratings would be:  Ambiance - 8/10 Food - 7.5/10 Hospitality - 8/10 Location of the place - 9/10 (Kormangala is a posh area - very well connected)  overall 8/10. We had a good time.  Suggestion; If you are a vegetarian or want to get vegetarian served someday - try this place."
5.0,The house serve purely veg foods..  A very good ambiance and the food was very delicious...worth a visit Taste 4.5/5 Ambiance 5/5  Value for money 4/5 Overall 4.5/5
4.0,Gramin is the best Indian veg restaurant that I have come across in Bng.. The food here is delicious. Ambience is good for a weekend get together. Waiters are polite. Price too is right.
4.5,"So, after a weekend of heavy meat feasts, my poor tummy wanted a lil rest, so the greedy me found out a way to full fill my cravings :D Gramin had always been in my bookmarks, but never had got the time to be there. Went there yesterday for dinner, and yes, got bowled over..like Totally!!!!  Ambience: lanterns, statues, cute tublers, copper glasses, bamboo decorations, wall paints in traditional style..all scream out the village thing which is not at all over the top, something which feels very justified with the theme and makes you comfortable, more homely kind of...the golden era songs add up to the ambience.. (4/5)  Location: Located in Raheja Arcade, Koramangala, This kind of spot on locations earns it the brownie points. (4/5)  Food: I was genuinely surprised to see the huge array of options for veg food.. We ordered the Lasooni Paneer Dhuadar, and boy, that did come with the Dhua :P (decorated in a plate with a steaming charcoal in the middle) , it just gave the perfeeeect start to the evening..Good in portions, better in taste, the secret paste marinated paneer just melts in your mouth. For the main course, we ordered Malai Kofta, Papad curry and kulchas. That was the best malai kofta I have had till date, totally at a loss of words.. The papad curry took me back to memories of childhood when momma used to make this unusual curry to be served with hot parathas.. <3 Ordered the buttermilk(they have a choice spicy/non spicy in this too) after this, as we had no place for desserts. It also passed with flying colors! (4.5/5)  Service: Food served in 20 minutes, decent waiters with good knowledge about the menu and fast service. (4.5/5) VFM: 4/5 (ours was RS 720 after hogging that much :D)  Highly recommended!"
4.5,"Reasonable... It's best place to hang out because of its price.  Thali is the best it's fills your stomach at less cost. They charge proportionately for what you have, that's the best of gramin."
3.5,"I had heard about this place for few times and that prompted me to try it out.I finally walked in there with my friend. I found the food was great with good options to select from.  I think they should restructure the arrangement for seating, but overall it was a good place to eat."
4.5,"Good food. Good ambience. 90s music. Takes you to the dhabas of North! They should increase the seating space. No matter what time you go, the waiting time is almost 30-40 minutes. But again for the love of food people wait."
4.0,"Visited this place for lunch after hearing lot of good things about it. It was recommended to us for Jain food. All the recommendations about the food turned out to be absolutely correct along with the warning about long waiting time. We had to wait for some 15-20 min. But the good thing is that they utilize that time by making you order beforehand so by the time you get your table, your food is ready to be served. We ordered kesar lassi  & masala buttermilk, both were excellent. For main course we had veg kolhapuri n paneer nawabi (Jain) which were delicious though a little spicy (which I don't mind at all, being a fan of spicy food). Most restaurants loose the taste in Jain preparations which was totally not the case here. The only thing missing was the dessert, I think they need to add the dessert section to their menu. All in all, a place to be if you want good food which is also light on pocket."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the huge queue outside this ordinary looking restaurant on a bright Sunday afternoon. The decor resembled that of a village hut in north India with mats used as curtains and intricately wood carved doors. I must say the space is very intelligently designed for the small floor area it has! Food is definitely delicious and truly north Indian. For starters, we had hara bhara kebab that was rightly spiced and freshly crisp. Then, we had aloo jeera Ki sabji and double tadka daal which took me back to my days in Delhi. The restaurant serves over of the best north Indian food I've had down south. #must visit  P.S. do not forget to have a sip of their rose kesar lassi :)"
4.5,"M not very fond of vegetarian dishes, as i am a hardcore non veg lover. But i visited this place on my partner's request and the food just took me by surprise! I just loved the food. The ambience is simple with little feeling of dhaba but the food is awesome. I love bhindi so we had bhindi sabzi and malai kofta. Was worth the try :)"
4.0,"I have been here with my friend for the dinner, we had waited for 5mins then we have entered in hotel . The ambience was good and the food quality was good.based in thast experience again on the very next day we tried special thali at lunch."
4.5,This is an amazing place. I went here with my friends for dinner. There was a long queue waiting to get inside the restaurant. And finally after waiting for 45 mins we got our table. The moment we sat down there was a long queue of waiters this time to serve us food. Since we orders the food in advance so we didn't have to wait any longer. And then it started. The staffs were so organised that the moment we finished our starters they brought our main course and so did they do for desserts and drinks(jaljeera). The food was outstanding.  There is nothing I can write wrong about. Waiting for 45 minutes was worth it.
4.5,"Finally found a good vegetarian place in koramangala. The food is great and the quantity is pretty good as well. Really worth the money. Ambience is pretty nice. Had a tough time searching for a place serving good vegetarian options a few days back. A friend had once suggested this place and I recollected only while walking past it. It is an awesome place. I am happy that we went a bit early around 7:30 pm. So, had to wait for 10 minutes only.  Awesome food. Great service. Impressed hat yey were taking order while people were seated outside. A busy restaurant trying to reduce its service time in an intelligent manner rather than hurrying people who are eating is a rarity. Moreover they keep.people engaged while they are re waiting. Would love to take more friends there."
4.0,"Its been a quite dinner with wife on Saturday eve.  Place and location is well known as stay very close to this place.  Food ambience quantity and quality 4 star rating 1star minus as service did not meet my expectations.  The ambience is good.  Punjabi Paneer tikka - 4 star ,chutney is not good Bhindi Rajasthani-4 star,fried well but feels missing a good chutney with it.  Butter naan and Kulcha is also good and matching  with the panner Kurkure curry,red gravy.  Overall 4 star and value for money."
4.0,"The food, the ambience and the service are good. Don't leave the place without having ""lassi"". Overall a very good experience and would like to go again."
4.0,"Good Veg restaurant, This was my first visit. I had North Indian Thali - Buttermilk and Got parcel of VegPulav (review was good by my friend) Over all a nice place and good food. Had good hospitality, place was almost full on a weekday by 2.30PM too. Will definitely visit again to try some more dishes. Outside looks of place may not make you feel good, But inside looks are really cool. Felt dishes are bit overpriced."
4.0,"Really good food. A bit expensive for veg food. The food is spicy, so if you don't like your food spicy inform the waiter. Dal and kolhapuri panner were simply amazing."
4.0,"Nice place to have a north Indian food without making hole in your pocket..nice ambience with old village kind of setup ....nice food especially bindhi fry.,dal and subjis are also nice.."
4.5,Really great place for north Indian food. Pocket friendly. Food was very good. Ambience is pretty good. Just a little crowded. But I loved the food!
1.0,"Gramin has very good food , But I had ordered and paid online for it and the order was never delivered..... Tinyowl and Opinio helped him in this Fraud  Especially the delivery boy Venkatarayappa(+919108519792)"
4.5,"I have loved eating here since my school days and I went in this time after a gap of 6 years! And its like its frozen in time! Exceptional service, tables getting filled withing 2 minutes, food as delicious as ever and the decor reminng you of a small but intricately decorated cottage! My favourite drink here has been the Jaljeera, till today, when i tried the Soda Hari Mirch. Its a fabulous balance between between sweet, spice and sour!  For starters we ordered just the masala papad and it was crisp with a generous amount of topping.  The mains included Methi Malai Matar, Channa Masala, and Fry all teamed up with a roti basket. The Methi Malai Matar was as delicious as ever(its flavor being accentuated by the yummy butter naans). The channa masala was spicy and well made. The dal just reminded me of yummy home cooked dal! A special mention to the absolutely delicious aam ka achar that they serve on the side!  To top this meal off, we ordered some delectable Gulab Jamuns and their texture and perfect sweetness just ended the meal on a great note.  Its easy on the pocket and serves good quantities. the servers are polite and effiient. I have always loved this place and the trip today just transported me back to my school days!                                             thegastronomyguide.wordpress.com"
4.5,I went here with a non vegetarian friend who was very apprehensive of going to vegetarian restaurant... Well she loved the food here... They serve typical marvadi food...the food tastes amazing and the restaurant is very welcoming... For some really good birth Indian food...I would definitely recommend this place! Food-9/10 Service -8/10 Ambience -9/10
3.0,"This place is inside the Raheja arcade, opposite Vodafone showroom.  WARNING : this is a vegetarian only restaurant. If you're a meat buff, please stay away from my review, as well as this place!!  Come here on a weekend for lunch, be prepared to wait for at least an hour to get a table here. You would be surprised to see how many vegetarians there are :)  You do get a chance to place your order even before you get a seat though!  As soon as you get to your table, you most certainly get your order,which is not such a bad thing!  Coming to the food, this place does serve you some amazing north Indian dishes. Try some of the paneer tikka and you're going to love it. The dal tadka here is good too.  I'm not quite sure why the prices are weird.  For eg: alu gobi is 96 rupees, dal tadka is 138 rupees, among other weird numbers. Why would you just not keep it simple!!  They seem understaffed and don't really provide a good service. The hospitality isn't there too. They're eagerly waiting you to get out of their restaurant. They actually got us our bill even before we finished our food. That's not excusable :( Haven't come back to this place after that. Plus, I'm not really a veg person :)  buttertheory.com"
5.0,A place where family and friends can enjoy a lot. I had the best north Indian food. The quantity provided is neither less nor more. Rates are reasonable too. Had my best time with friends.
4.0,"Visited Gramin last Sunday. Located in the Raheja complex., Gramin offers great food! Good atmosphere, good taste ! Good Sunday it was !!!"
4.5,"Rushing up and down Koramangala to get my documents printed proved to be tiring so we decided to lunch in at Gramin while things were getting done. After all that meat in the past few days, we decided we needed vegetables in our lives to continue being healthy. Located inside Raheja arcade, it looked small from the outside but was quite big once we entered. The crowd was just filling up, we went upstairs and got a table easily.  We were waited upon almost immediately. Our initial plan was to order three dishes apart from rice and chapati but our waiter informed us that it was too much for two people. We'd asked for bhindi ka anardhana, bhaingan bhartha, kesar lassi, butter naan and steamed rice. In spite of certain items being listed as spicy, he assured us that they wouldn't be, if we asked for it. Looking around, the place had typical Indian knick knacks around placed for decor. The bronze tumblers and mirrored objects around gave me the impression I was in Rajasthan or Jaipur. Service was excellent with waiters being attentive and informative. Top marks for visual appeal as each dish was uniquely presented. Bindi ka anardhana was a dry item with golden fried shallots crowned with pomegranate seeds. Bhaingan ka bhartha was garnished with tomato and a sprinkle of grated cheese. Kesar lassi was delicious. Portion size is quite generous. It was difficult for the two of us to finish. The place  was very economical, great value for money in terms of portion to price ratio."
2.0,Went back to lunch here after a couple of years - used to love their food before so much that we didn't mind long waiting times. But this time it was disappointing. The thali tasted very very ordinary - so much so that I dont even remember what was served in it except for the phulkas. Nothing to write about the jaljeera as well.
4.5,"Finally a good North Indian cuisine in Bangalore. Preparation and the quantity of the meal is satiating. Do try the Afghani Daal here!! Since the place is always crowded, the service is a bit slow."
2.0,"It's just that, I couldn't relate myself to this place. Everything about it is pretty ordinary starting from ambience ,services until food. Located right at the heart of the Raheja complex in Kormangala.   You could easily figure it out due to the huge amount of people waiting outside. Heared this place is on for almost 10 years, seems living up to the hype created by its lover becoz I have found restaurants serving equal or better quality of north indian foods with better hygiene as well.  Have been to this place twice and found nothing amazing or wow kind of stuff which would be remembered for long. The last time I went over and asked for signature dish. They suggested me for sarso da saag and makke de roti. Alongwith I tried Handi biryani as well. Accept roti, I found rest of the stuffs terribly wrong. Saag was undercooked and biryani was overspiced with no flavour whatsoever. Beware they use huge amount of oil, for food to look and tastes good. Best one to say is bhindi masala, gobhi masala and Kaju masala which I had earlier.   Sorry guys the experience was not at all good for me and a honest opinion is served here that impacted the rating. But still I would like to give one more time just to strike the right chord. YOU NEVER KNOW !!!!"
4.0,This place is value for money. Food is good. Vagetarians get many variates. Place is now renowned.  It's bit crowed always. Vehicle parking is problematic.
4.5,"Nice place to have food.. Tried peas and corn snacks, it was mouth watering.. Loved spicy jal jeera.. Food is awesome.. The real problem is space and waiting time.. Waiting time is really very high over here, but worth as the quality of food is very good"
4.0,"Located close to Forum Mall, the place has good ambience and space is well managed even though place is small. Had Mughlai Palak Kofta(decent) which had Palak gravy and Kofta made of mashed Potato and Paneer. Paneer Do Pyaza was pretty good which should be tried at this place. Tandoori Roti and Lachcha Paratha stood to their name.    If you are looking for a North Indian Restaurant which serves good and less oily/butter/spice food then this is the place you should try."
3.5,"Located in Raheja Arcade, you know that you are in for a long wait as you see the long queue. This was my first visit (theoretically 3rd as previous two have been complete failure due to extremely long queue) and was determined to have my way into it.  Thankfully waiting time was for half an hour so we gave the order and waited patiently for our turn and finally got the table in allocated time.  The place is small though clean and cozy. Brick wall adorned painting and craft works. Seating chairs were a bit uncomfortable. Soothing bollywood music was being played in background.   We were served with masala papad as complementary and munched on it while waiting for our orders to arrive. Brass coated plates and glasses were there which enhanced the ethnicity of this place.  First came the rose lassi which was pretty much average. An average start I would say.  We ordered for bread basket which had assortment of tandoori roti, naan and paratha. Along with it, we ordered for paneer babycorn jhalfrezi and sarson ka saag. It took around 20 minutes to be served.  Paneer babycorn jhalfrezi was very nicely done. It was rightly spiced and the quantity was enough for 3.  Sarson ka saag was also very much generous in quantity. Taste wise it was ok. Along with it, some jaggery was given.  We also ordered for a missi roti though have to say that it was not baked property as taste and smell of raw dough was prominent.  A nice place for vegetarian's and would recommend this place to everyone as food here is quite good in taste as well as economical."
4.5,It is a small place but the food is very tasty. All the food items which we had tried over here were having good quantity as well as very good taste. I had been here thrice and none of the times I had been disappointed. It was very good.  I particularly liked jaljeera. Must visit place for a vegetarian. Service was also very good as waiters were very prompt.
3.5,Good food but too spicy for my taste. Very congested seating area and extremely noisy. Not a good place if you want to relax and chat. Slightly overpriced too.
3.5,Ambience is very good. A little overpriced menu. Not satisfied with the taste of curries in their Thali. There are many other restraunts which provide better thali.
4.0,"Gramin is a bit difficult to spot in the hustle and bustle of Koramangala. This place is in Raheja Arcade, diagonally opp. to Forum, Koramangala. Food is pure veg, north Indian and lip smacking. I have always seen this place full and have waited atleast 15-20 mins for a table. One must try the #Pineapple Raita, #Masala Papad along with the food. I can easily say that their flavored and classic lassi is also amongst the best in the city that I have had. I will definitely recommend this place for pure vegetarians."
4.5,This is one of the v good places to have vegetarian north indian cuisine. I went here with my friends. Among starters v ordered masala papad which was good and I jus so love their nimbu ki shikanji.. V ordered methi malai mutter and paneer handi that could go well with rotis.  Taste is jus amazing..everything is good at this place except it gets crowded a lot many times which makes us wait.
3.5,"Food - 4/5 Hygiene - 4/5 Pricing - 3/5 Menu - 3.5/5 Service - 3/5 Ambiance - 3/5  Weighted average Final Score - 3.56 Rating -  3.5(nearest to 3.56)  Vegetarians dine in Food is good but little bit spicy. Service is bit slow. Hygiene and cleanliness is fine. Food is served in copper utensils. Feel good ambiance, but seats are not comfortable. Rs 500 for 2 seems OK on pricing side. Indian retro music in background gives good feeling. Usually on holidays waiting time after 8 PM is around 30-40 mins.

2.0,Dishes had no flavours...soup had very much less salt n plain favour... Nice ambience n service.. Bt am very much disappointed with food..did nt reach my expectation..
3.5,"Whenever I feeling like eating out and its a complete vegetarian affair, my only escapade is Gramin.  For me its one of the finest veg restaurants inBangalore. Theambiancegives you the feel of a Rajasthani village.Our regular favorites are the Harabhara Kebab,Babycorn masaledar and the Masala Papad. We then cool off the spices with a refreshing Nimbu Sikhanji or a Lassi. If you love your bread basket you can opt for the stuffed Kulcha or the Butter Naan. The Rice items are edible nothing special about them.You can team up your Rice/ Roti with Veg Kadai , Dhaba Veg, Banjara Paneer,Paneer Kolhapuri or Veg handi.The service is good.On weekends the place iscrammedup with people, so its better to go a bit early andgrab a place :) Food - 4/5  Service - 3/5  Ambiance - 3/5"
4.0,"Oh what a joy it is to have your belly filled with food that puts a smile on your face and doesn't drastically lessen the weight of your wallet. I've been visiting gramin since I was a young boy and after all these years I'm still delighted to visit this place for a nice, wholesome meal. I don't often consider going to a vegetarian restaurant when I dine outside but this is the one exception and that just goes to show how great the food here is. Their rotis, naans and kulchas are done perfectly and their curries are incredible. I'm salivating at the mere thought of them as I  type out this review. I don't recall having a bad plate of food here, the dishes have bags of flavour and are terribly filling. So do order judiciously so you can leave some room for the handi biriyani which is absolutely lovely, and try the lassi as well. I love how homely the food tastes and how genuine, simple and unpretentious the ambience is. The staff is swift, courteous and prompt. Gramin is surely one of my favourites for reasons that go beyond just their food."
5.0,"Speciality of this place is their veg thali they give you good customisation of the ambience looks very good, try there Lemon sickanji and you will fall in love with it"
4.5,"Loved the ambience, theme, food, service; in short everything about the place. A place which can be tried multiple times for veg north Indian food."
4.0,"The last weekend was dedicated to do food hopping with friends and we happened to roam in and around Koramangala, trying roadside chats, steamed momo's, bhuttas, chai and what not. The end to the exciting and first ever food hopping could not have been better than eating at Gramin - the authentic North Indian veggie delight.  The ambiance of the place is very pristine and takes you back to the good old countryside, reminding you of the 'Kacha Houses', 'Roshandaans', 'Lanterns' and what not. The place already looks awesome, but just a suggestion if the management could replace the waiting area chairs (which by the way, are always full) with traditions 'Manjhis' :) :)  The food menu is very exhaustive. You would find delicacies on the menu, which are not otherwise so common anywhere else in Bangalore. This is for all those who think that the food choice for all vegetarians starts at dal-subzi and ends at paneer, please visit Gramin and you will realize how wrong and judgmental you are :) :)  To start with, we ordered 'Sweet Corn' soup was was a great appetizer, very different from conventional 'Sweet Corn' soups served at different places - much thicker and creamy and would suggest as a must try (but would suggest to add a tinge of salt and black pepper). We also tried 'Masala Papad' which was nice but could have been better. In main course, we tried the 'Panner Kadhai' & 'Papad Curry' with 'Jeera Rice' and 'Kulchas'. Liked the curries and kulchas, but 'Jeera Rice' could have been better, especially the quality of rice which seemed a little inferior viz. a viz. other food delicacies served at the place. And yes, not to forget the food in Gramin is served in traditional copper and steel utensils, which adds to the overall experience of being in a countryside :) :)  The service was spot on and we experienced no lag..Not only this, the staff was very courteous and kept on asking us if we liked the food and hospitality.  So, overall would rate Gramin as below -  Food Quality - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Ambiance - 4/5  Overall - 4/5  A must visit pocket friendly place in Bangalore !!"
4.0,"Good restaurant for Vegetarians. Food tastes good, their Veg Gravies sometimes have lot of oil otherwise a good place to have food.  I liked the tawa gobi starter."
4.5,One must try place for both vegetarian and non-veg people.  Food was really delicious.  Must try. ...sarsondi sag with makai Di roti and allu  chutki   Overall a good experience
3.5,The place is good and the prices are also reasonable. The place is apt for vegetarians that like simple food. The only issue I had was that dal was extremely spicy.
4.0,A complete vegetarian restaurant in kormangla. We  went there on Friday night ..the ambience was very good ...a little dhabha style and a little village style...starters were good in taste ... The main course was just ok...can't say that it was bad but was not very good.....last was the Lassi we ordered ..that was AWESOME.... Nice place to visit with family and friends #GRAMIN
3.5,"I have been to gramin for 3 times... All the times accompanying my colleagues. Majority of them being north Indians they love this place. Always remembered we waiting for at least 15 mins before we get a seat. Thali here is good for just 125 ... Fits the pocket and satisfies our stmach too. Plus points of the thali: 1. Pocket friendly 2. 3 curries .. With ample quantity 3. Always the sweet was gulab jamun which tasted good 4. Perfect ambience.. Dhaba style  Minus for the thali: 1. It doesn't have a starter.. Not really a negative point as its price is anyway less.. 2. Hard tandoori rotis. Though they serve hot rotis , somehow they turn hard after sometime 3. Not so flavourful curries. I find some of their curries bland.. Though my north Indian colleagues don't agree to this point"
3.5,The place n seating arrangement utensils make u feel that you are in Gramin Ultimate peas fry is followed by okay okay rotis n not so good veg masala  Ambience was only way to attract with unreasonable prices
3.5,"One of the most surprising thing for me would be to be here to write review. All, veg restaurant and a carnivorous like me - here ? Well, Sabarimala is all to blame ;-). We had a gathering of old colleagues and the whole gang was vegeterian so automatically we went to Gramin. It sure looked popular when we arrived here. There was a wait time of 20 minutes before we could get a table of 5.  The service staff was smart to have worked out the delay in seating and asked us to take place our order while we wait that way there was no time wasting once we land at the table.  We ordered a lot of stuff. The quantity of the curries and the rice were a bit less but most of them tasted great. Specially the starters. Only issue (and it could be my issue) that I saw was our orders consisted heavily of Paneer.  ..... Details on each order soon  Service staff was very attentive and smart.  The setup was, well, Gramin style. Mud colored walls and village type interiors.  The price - 1700 for 5 people, sounds like a decently priced place by Bangalore counts. But personally its slightly on the higher side."
4.0,Excellent desi khanna...glad we found this place..nice simple feel to it..excellent service..the rajasthani bindhi is a must try..and you finally get shikanji in Bangalore...
4.0,"A pure veg place..!! Taste of the food in nice. Some dishes are really very spicy. So if ordering something make sure its in medium spicy level. You can get different variety of dishes at this place,which I guess will not be found in other restaurants. A try out place for foodies."
4.0,"This place is quite close to my office. I have been there for lunch couple of times, mostly on Friday. You might have to wait 20-25 mins before you get a table on Friday afternoon.  The food is really nice and nothing so far has disappointed us. Tawa corn peas and Kesar Lassi is must try. Tried most of their gravies and everything is nice.  Ambience is good, place is hygienic. If you are in a mood to have North Indian and you are close to Forum Mall then its worth a visit."
4.0,"Pocket friendly, Calm, small and nice place to have a sumptuous lunch or dinner.  Enjoyed the unique way of serving dishes in Bronze utensils."
4.5,"TL;DR : Let's just say this place was so great, it motivated me to write my first review on Zomato.  Starting with the basics, this place has a nice ambience with rustic interiors and menu cards on the cane, copper vessels and the ever pleasing 60s Bollywood soundtrack.  Tava Karela : One word - ingenious. They took an item I completely hate, Karela, and turned it into a delicious bitter sweet crunchy snack with coated jaggery and cashews and raisins thrown in.  Babycorn Masala Pander : Again, innovative and different. Whoever tried serving babycorn with paneer before? They did. And it was fabulous.  Methi malai paneer : A sumptuous main course dish full with soft paneer, sweet cream and flavourful methi.  Dhaba Veg : A mixed veg dish like you've never had before, complete with Indian spices and flavour.  Bonus: The bread they served was as delicious as the dishes. One was the Phirki Paratha, made with chili, onions and garlic.  Everything said, you'll never look at vegetarian food the same way again once you've been here. Looking forward to go there again and try out their other unique dishes."
3.5,"Food is average and the way it is served is pretty good. They serve you in thalis which makes it easier to eat ;-)  The restaurant is small so sometimes you will have to wait for your turn especially during the weekends. They recently extended and renovated the place, which may have solved the issue. It is a good place to have dinner after hectic shopping at Raheja arcade !"
5.0,"One amongst the restaurants which I would prefer to visit frequently. Being a pure vegetarian, I find this place as the perfect place for Lunch/Dinner. Gramin serves good North Indian Food. Interiors are good as well with light music making the whole Ambience perfect."
5.0,Interior of restaurant is amazing ... Food is delicious...lassi a must try...would love to go often ...service is good...not so expensive ..
3.5,"Very good Northindian place. They have indian versions of Gobi Manchurian, fries and all. It tastes really good. Bhindi kurkure is just brilliant. Went here a couple of times and always loved it. Try going early on the weekends. the place get filled up very fast and there is waiting time. Drinks and desserts are aslo good. Ordered Lassi and jamun."
4.5,"This place gives you a homely feeling.. I loved the ambience thoroughly..  Tried : Paneer Kurkure, Makai seekh kabab, masala papad, Roti, Gramin Kofta, Punjabi Paneer, Butter milk. Loved the starters. The subjis had a tangy flavour, different from the usual extremely spicy subjis.  Must try : Butter milk."
3.5,"The place is legendary for veg lovers and has a huge crowd lined up to get in for a meal. The place has a nice staff who is good with serving you continuously while not making it feel like they are hushing you out faster, the place interiors makes you feel like a low paid hotel on a village side but still clean and well maintained. The food ordered was starters, main course and some gravy with roti's, the starters were crispy baby corn and had a good taste, the rotis were hot ghee phulka's. The veg pulav and bhindi gravy was also tasty, very few times that I would enter a vegetarian restaurant and commend the food, but yes this restaurant was good with taste and service. The bill was quite low compared to what I expected and very reasonable for such a stomach filled dinner."
4.0,"Gramin is centrally located and gets good points for it's village/dhaba themed ambience, menu cards, tables, cutlery. The food can range from really spicy to sweet. Make sure to indicate your spice level so you don't end up gulping down water. Allahabadi & Kolhapuri type dishes are more spicy and a chilli is indicated on the menu card. They also cater to Jain with their Jain friendly dishes. Also note the less calorie foods which we didn't try. The roti basket is good for three people and can get really heavy for two. Some rotis were hard and difficult to chew. We also ordered Mint lemon cooler and masala chaas which were good for quenching the fire from the spicy food. Overall, a good place to visit with family and friends. Dinner for two costs anywhere between 400 and 600 depending on appetites."
4.0,"Never been too fond of North Indian food until I had a big fat lunch here! And by far, the best I can remember. From copper plates and tumblers to the Rajasthani decors, every other detail had a spectacular touch of tradition. You shouldn't be expecting too much if you're a non vegetarian, though! And  The big glass of cold sweet lassi is a must!"
3.0,"There is nothing exceptional about this place. You might have a very high expectation if you are visiting it for first time. The food is okay okay.. normal and fresh but not extra ordinary. . staff is friendly , ambience is good.. might visit when you want to have a simple lunch or dinner."
4.0,I am a pure non vegitarian by palate. It feels like waste of money wen i spend on veg but it was completely a different experience in gramin..... awesome delucious vegetarian food in town...... everything on the menu is finger licking...... would love to go again
2.0,it was an awesome place for north Indian food in koramangala..but off late the the taste and quality had degraded drastically..stay away from dal makhani..tastes like hospital food..
4.0,"Nice pure veg restaurant. It doesn't give much feelings like sitting in a village(gain), but ambience is ok. But you ll get a very good homely cooked food over there. I like the sarson ka saag( Mustard leaf curry), with Makai roti... That's really nice. Not only that, every preparation is good there at a very affordable cost.. Service is also nice. But It's recommend that if you are going on weekends then book a table before..."
4.0,"Veg food and tastes exactly like home made :)Something tell me that they dont add MSG to their servings :)Sufficient spread of menu and tasty as well !The only lopside is the seating, wasnt comfortable ! :(Location - 4/5Food - 4/5Service - 3.5/5Will I get back? - I do not have a veg craving but when I do this is a must visit !"
4.5,"""Gramin"", this is the word which comes in mind when you think of country food and rightly so. They deserve this. Ambience: Awesome. Very well designed interiors and even the plates and glasses are carefully chosen to match up to the name.  Food: Menu reads every food item which is generally eaten in the country side. I ordered sarso da saag with makai di roti and it was yum. We also tasted the tikha soda, butter milk, mix veg curry, phulka, etc. And it was great.  Cost: It's pocket friendly. Not too costly if you compare it with other theme based restaurants.  Overall, a pleasant experience. Will come back soon. #happycustomer"
4.0,"For good Indian veg food, Gramin is the place to be. I had dineer here a few years back when I was on a trip to Bangalore and was not actually living here. And then yesterday. I can say, there has been no compromise on the food quality.   We ordered gramin kofta, double tarka daal and mix veg raita with some naan and tawa fulka. Though the preparations were a bit spicy, but very tasty.  It is a must visit place for the vegetarians. However, be prepared for long waiting queue. But the good part is that you can give the order while you are waiting and the food is served as you take your table."
3.5,"This was my first visit to Gramin, located in Raheja Arcade, Koramangala and I loved the food there. This place is interestingly decorated with a typical village like set up.Ambiance is good but there is lack of space as it is over crowded mostly specially during weekends .But the food is worth the wait and we really had a great time .Service is prompt .Overall a good place for all the Vegans. Surely will visit again!!!"
1.5,Didn't find the restaurant good quality wise. lot of floating oil on vegetables. cold rotis. man these restaurant charge so much and cannot give fresh rotis. mutter paneer has hardly any paneer. quite ordinary.
4.0,"Had dinner today at Gramin which was a regular joint for me few years back. We ordered for masala papad, bhindi rajasthani, chaas, butter naan, panjabi paneer and gulab jamoon.  The masala papad was okay but the bhindi rajasthani as always was yummy :). Masala chaas was not that great but the panjabi paneer with whole coriander seeds seasoning on it was very good. The gulab jamoons were okay.  On the whole a nice place to have some great food."
5.0,Excellent  place for a affordable lunch. Starters   baby corn mazedar  is simply lip smacking .  Coming to main course  Gramin Biryani is not great but can have once. Waiters are very reactive and always smiling.  Good place to go if ur in for something  north indian authentic
4.0,"VISIT 1: Been here for a lunch date with Swarna Sathya :) North Indian lunch craving fully satiated! Perfect location, great ambience and decor although the seating can be better arranged to accommodate more people! We ordered the Chatpata Babycorn Panneer along with corn soup for the starters :) The former was served with pudina chutney which was tangy and tasty and yummily cooked and was heavy in quantity :) the soup was a major drawback for me! Main course had malai kofta and kadai panner along with butter rotis and kulchas. Both the gravy's were appetising and tasted delicious :) Once again, the quantity was a little too much for 2! We definitely enjoyed the whole meal and the service :) Swarna Sathya wouldn't deny as well :) Looking forward to another visit soon!  VISIT 2: This time, I tried the thali. The thali came with a dry sabzi, one with gravy and one dal. The dal was very bland and tasted weird. The 2 sides were pretty decent and were just enough in quantity.  The Thali serves 4 ghee phulkas ( or one can opt for 2 rotis) which were really soft and I personally loved them. There's also a crispy papad which is so small it gets over in 2 bites. There's also a small part of salad which is a little disappointing, it lacked proper seasoning and the veggies were cut irregularly.  There's also a small, really small serving of jeera rice as a part of the thali. It comes with a katori of raita for sides. The rice tasted really delicious and left me craving for more. Quantity of this could be definitely improved.  For desert, there was gulab jamoon which was soft and yummy and left us happy after our meal.   I would rate this visit 3.5/5. Quantity of almost everything could be improved.  Each thali costs 130INR."
3.0,Value of money: 4/5 Taste: 3.5/5 Ambience: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Order time: 2/5 Bill producing time: 1.5/5  Quiet a crowded place. Many times you have to wait outside on plastic chairs.  Food taste is good. Surprised to see they make us to wait for 15 minutes just to produce the bill.
3.5,Have had variety of experiences.....from an average one to a good one very recently (nov 2015).....overall a place suggested which is friendly to the pocket and the people.
5.0,"Excellent place for family. Nice food. Nice place,nice food,good service I went for first time and the experience was good. This place was suggest by my friend."
4.0,Awesome vegetarian food. Missi roti was superbly tasty. Lassi was okay. The ambience and the utensils used justify the name 'Gramin'. Vegetarians in Bangalore! Give it a try. You will not regret.
4.0,"A North Indian veg restaurant. Mostly crowded. You have to wait at least 20-30 min. Service is quick and organized. They take your orders while you are waiting.   Food is tasty overall. Do try the Butter Milk,  pudina Paratha, Double Tadka Dal, kadai Paneer, Dal Makhani these are my favorites. Also gulab jamun for desert."
3.0,"A typical village set up, located near Forum Mall -kormangla. The ambience is beautiful with small chairs & tables. It reminds me of Gujarat or Maharashtrian  tradition and culture. The waiters are dressed traditionally too.  The food was really good a few years back but now the quality has decreased. Can't really expect authentic North Indian food but you can try once!"
3.5,Usually go here for just the sweet lassi and the paneer ka Salaan . Best dishes I've liked so far . I Don't eat a lot of paneer ( to be precise veg ) but this dish is really tasty
4.5,Cute restaurant tucked inside Raheja complex ( near forum Kormangala ). I have been visiting this from the time am in bangalore. It's not too much on pocket either. Great choices for vegetarian especially we dishes like the bindi kurkure. The painting in the wall is also great. Tables are a bit small for my height but food compensates !!
4.5,The best place to have vegetarian food!! I have been to Gramin like a hundred times in the past 8 years..and still I can never say no to this place. It has maintained their food quality all these years..Thumbs up guys!!
3.0,"A small place in Raheja arcade, crowded on weekends and had option of ordering while I was waiting. Service quick once I got the table and Food was good. Had tried panner sabzi and dal."
4.0,Gramin is very pocket friendly restaurant. Its has a very simple decor and mostly its overcrowded. Their thali is too good to try.. Panner dishes and veg kholapuri have been decent.. Must try if you are running low on budget.
3.5,"On a friend's recommendation, we visited this place on a weekend. To our disappointment, the place was overly crowded, and we had to wait for around an hour to get seats. The ambiance was a bit villagish, for the name suggests the same. Menu had a good variety. We ordered typical paneer and daal, with tandoori roti. The order came in around half an hour, but everybody was spellbound by the taste. The dinner ended with delicious lassi and jaljeera, with gulab jamun as dessert. Amazing food, but poor service."
1.0,"Worst experience. had gone with brother & family, Soup was pathetic, could not drink more than one sip, Starter & main course also not good. only thing I liked was Nimbu pani"
3.5,"Good option for vegetarians The drinks was very nice like jaljeera, Pudina Katta meeta. Gravies was good Gobi chatpata was my favorite starter, it had different taste compared to normal manchurian types in other restaurants."
4.0,Jam pack place and huge waiting specially on Sundays says much about the place. Food is delicious and at reasonable price Great place for pure veg people. Ambience is not much. Service is good enough. 2 wheeler Parking is  not dere
4.0,"A great place to eat.. This is one of those bank for the buck restaurants.. The place is a bit crowded and thanks to the area being small makes it feel even more so. But, the food is quite tasty.. The prices are low as well which is a very rare find nowadays.. Have patience to wait for your turn for the tables.. Recommend from my side.. Must try place in Bangalore especially when u are in and around koramangala.."
1.0,"My 3 year old just finished vomiting twice. Thanks to the lunch at Gramin today. Ok so its not any coincidence. My mom, wife and I are suffering from a bloated stomach since afternoon and the lunch here is the only thing we all had in common today. This place is (or was) supposed to be one of the best veg restaurants in Koramangala area, but I think its not anymore. Maybe one of the dishes we ordered was recycled or had something stale in it. But stomach isn't the the only thing I am complaining about, the taste was really bad considering that the 6 different things we had. Anyways, one place off my list. Some of these old joints take it for granted , but its not going to last."
4.0,"Had been to this place once for a bday party. Well, the place is a bit short in space but nevertheless quiet warm & cozy in its appeal. About the food.. its tasty and affordable.. the corn pulav is a must try among everything else!"
3.5,Everything here is spicy! Even 'thandai' which is basically badam milk is spicy. Gramin biriyani is green in color ;) ofcourse spicy and the raitha was good. Paneer kolhapuri was plentiful. The ambience is really great with a village charm!
2.5,"One of the ok veg restaurants in Koramangala. First time I got to realize about inflation when I got their servings, that less which makes you order same curry in two. Less space so waiting time is long."
3.5,"Gramin is traditional is every sense of the word. The place has ambiance, furnishing and decors as well as cutlery modeled on a typical north Indian countryside eatery. It is usually crowded and invariably you have to wait to get your table, especially if you are in a group. The tables were too close to my comfort but they have managed their best to accommodate as many tables as possible within a limited space available. My favorite dishes include Bhindi Rajasthani, Harabhara kebab, malai kofta. Their Bhoondi raita is awesome. Masala butter milk is one the best i have ever tasted. Service is bit tardy while cost-wise it is definitely value for your money.                                                                 srirelishes.blogspot.com"
3.5,Been here a while ago... The ambience is pleasant and rural types... The staff are welcoming! And the food is very good too... Try the butter milk and the paneer tikka! And the biryani!
2.5,Not worth the hipe... Got food parcel after a long time but looking at so many people it surely can do better to live up to craze everyone shows
3.5,"I went to this place one evening with one of my friend. It was a weekday.  The food here was good, simple and home like. We ordered paneer curry with phulka's and nothing else as we were not much hungry. Liked the taste and the simplicity of this place.  If you are around in kormangala and want to have a quite meal and nothing jazzy. You can head over to this place."
4.0,Great place visited unexpectedly. Very small in place great in taste and good at dishes. Worst on Que. experienced the difference. Overall good one. Love to visit again
4.5,"Ultimate place for vegetarians. The best part is if you dont like an item, they will take it back without charging a single penny for it. Though you have to wait a bit as it is always heavily crowded and people will be waiting in Queue. But still its worth the wait and price too. They serve a descent quantity too. So overall a good place for vegans. Would love to visit again and again."
4.0,"Food haven for vegetarians and doesnt burn a hole in your pocket. With its veg only menu, the never ending main course section took me by surprise. And to their credit, every last one of their dishes is delicious. The Indian breads section also has a lot to offer (including amazing butter kulchas). Highly recommended."
1.0,"Went with my friend to have dinner, it was raining, so this was close option for us, well, later I felt, wish we could have waited or gone some where else...very disappointed with place, food and staff.  First place I saw, where they served aloo paratha without curd and pickle, dont know the basics, staff said, we need to ask, paratha with curd, when taking order nobody asked us, and we thought curd and pickle is common...and, channa masala was worst i ever had, I would never suggest anybody go there, rest, up to ones wish..."
3.5,It's always crowded... No wonder.. One of the best place for reasonable priced authentic veggy food..  Must try.....place.
3.5,"One of the restaurants in Koramangla which serves good North Indian food at very reasonable price. This used to be our regular apart from Om cafe to have lunch since our office was a block away. The taste of the food is quite good and the place is full during lunch time on most weekdays as well. Waiting is long as they don't have too much of seating space. North Indian Thali @ 88 with 2 sabjis, daal, tandoori roti and rice used to a attraction."
3.5,"If you have a group of friends that you don't really like, but have to treat and want to impress, without burning a hole in your pocket, then this is the place. It's a decent restaurant with a decent, slightly crammed ambience. The food is fresh and the quality is consistent. I recommend the ""arvi ke kabab, kurkuri bhindi and any paneer dish"". The "" mirch soda"" gets a special mention because it's like a coin flipping game, meaning it can either be tolerantly spicy or ' burn a hole in your mouth ,make a grown man cry' kinda spicy.  Overall ..... You won't complain"
3.5,"A very well utilisation of space and very well interior setup. Fully vegetarian eatery. It attracts the nearby IT Janta for Friday lunch. If you are wearing your Company Tag, you won't feel out of the place :P Butter Milk is good ;)"
4.5,"There are very less pure vegetarian restaurants in Bangalore, one of the best among them is this. I was happy to see so many jain items in the menu, which is very rare. Taste is amazing and the buttermilk is yumm  service is slow but in the end all that matters is food  :D"
3.5,"Gramin absolutely gives the feeling of  having food in village. The tables,  chairs, plates, glasses, food menu etc. ... in short overall ambience is made up in village style. .. Food is really fresh and tasty  . Good service  and affordable"
3.5,"A decent place for some homely North Indian vegetarian food. Parking can be a hassle for 4 wheelers, so you will have to park in the lanes behind Punjab Grill or on any of the bylanes of JNC road.  For 3 people, we ordered 6 tandoori rotis, 2 butter naans, muttar paneer, dal fry, bhindi anardana and masala papad and were pretty happy with the service and the quality of the food. The paneer dish was slightly sweet and the bhindi was slightly sour. But the dal, the masala papad and the fresh rotis were definitely delicious! Nice and hearty   Don't expect too much in terms of ambience and the seating. It is sort of clustered but in terms of food; good VFM."
4.0,Great location but you will find parking to be troublesome. A tiny restaurant with desi yet colourful interiors gives this restaurant a very homely vibe. The food is fantastic and you must try their cold refreshments like jal jeera and lime shikanji.. i did not like their babycorn starters but the paneer platter was excellent.. Roti and subji were delicious too and what's best is you don't feel the pinch because its veey well priced. All in all a great place to dine in.
1.5,"I was going through the gramin reviews and i can see most of the people has rated it 4.0 , 4.5 , 3.5 . May be the people had good time there but it was not good for me. I went to gramin restaurant on 3/8/2015 for dinner. Glasses were dirty and i had to replace it three times saying glasses are not clean. I request everyone who had rated it above 4.0 to visit this place again and observe their glass from inside. Due to this water gets dirty and people have to drink dirty water. At last I had to order mineral water bottle. Now I come to food. I ordered veg seekh kabab, dal makhni , green peas pulav, double tadka daal , paneer methi malai , roti. Panner methi malai was too too sweet. It was like desert. I knew this dish was not spicy and was at sweeter side but this much sweet I did't expected. Paneer was dry and no taste.  Double daal tadka and dal makhni - It was the worst dal makhni i had ever taster. Who puts capsicum piece in dal makhni?? I am very fond of dal makhni so wherever i visit north indian restaurant , i will definitely order it. But after eating this i felt i have to change my views now.  Veg seekh kabab was ok .  I am giving it 1.5 because i did't have good experience here. I request management to make cleanness in their restaurant. May be I had bad day from food perspective but cleanness is definitely required."
4.0,"A Classic North Indian Restaurant which serves delicious vegetarian food. Trust me, all non-vegetarians too are gonna love the food here, main reason is the authenticity and richness of the food. It's located in Raheja Arcade, that's like the entrance to Koromangla itself. Don't miss their THAALI's especially which will just load you up lots lots of yummy veg khana! Their drinks too have a nice variety of choices within the North Indian kitchen menu."
3.5,"Usually go at this place on no non-veg day or for veg people. :) Clean and nice setup/ambience. They serve different type of veg drinks (golf in taste - chaach, lassi,etc). Food and starters are good(no mushroom). Service is good. Overall a good place to go for Pure veg people."
4.5,"Visited the place on a Sunday afternoon a little early.There were a lot of vacant seats.Considering the number of people having lunch,the service was a bit slow. We had rotis with Paneer Handi and Sarason ka saag.The food was great especially the rotis. The ambiance was good with some cute miniature paintings. Not heavy on the pocket  Food-5/5 Ambiance-4.5/5 Cleanliness-5/5 Service-4/5"
3.5,"I am posting review after my 3rd visit to Gramin, I feel authenticity of taste is no more maintained. No doubt Food is good but value for money is not fulfilled."
4.0,"Me and Gramin go back a very long way.. The simplicity yet the authenticity is what I love.. Extremely busy.. I have been to this restaurant so many times that the people there know what I order as well..   Typical village style ambience. Nice old school Hindi music. Delicious food served in a steel n brass coated plates and glasses. Their juices are yummy and frothy. Crisp papads and nice range of entrees.   Will I go there again, I have been to this place twice in the last week.. So you can take a guess."
4.5,Nice place for vegetarian people... Love the ambience... Lots of variety... Great taste. Also for drinks... Cost is little high.. Lots of people are coming so have to wait...
4.0,I like the lunch meals here as the taste is nice. The chatpata babycorn paneer and the masala butter milk are my favorite. The roti's and kulcha's are nice. Overall experience is nice.
3.0,"A good place to be for pure veg north Indian food. Taste is good and like any other medium size food joint. Rustic ambience adds to the experience. Nominal on pocket also. Possible let down areas can be - long wait due to low capacity, disturbing traffic noise, non availability of parking."
4.0,"Biggest positive: Taste, price.  Negative: Parking  Recommended dish: Paneer korma with butter naan   Located in Raheja arcade. Parking for 4 wheelers will be a major problem since they do not allow to park inside Raheja arcade, so finding parking on the streets of koramangala will be time consuming. Ambience is decent. It is a bit different from the ordinary. Service is usually slow. Is often crowded.  The food is tasty. A long list of north Indian breads and sabji's to chose from. The lassi was not good. Quantity is pretty decent. Pricing is very fair.  On the whole, its a place for a nice north Indian lunch at a very reasonable price."
4.5,"Being a non-vegeterian myself, couldn't have been to a better place to have pure veg food anywhere else in Bangalore. From having a wide variety of gravies to choose from to having a total 70s looking ambience, this place has everything a Vegetarian wants when they miss home. Very economical. If going for lunch, try out the Thali, for a person like me with a huge appetite, the Thali was more than enough."
3.0,"Heaven for pure veg lovers. The concept (chauki and small tables resembles that of a village and hence named as gramin) People from my college visit there in bulks ... Also, it is reasonable for throwing birthday parties! I liked the beverages - lassi and starters - paneer pakoda..more than main course.. Would like to try kofta (curry) sometime.."
4.0,"It's a delightful place to visit for veg only food. What I love about this place is the ambience and above all food is great, however overly crowded to an extent that people wait in queue to grab a place. The crowd here speaks for its popularity. My personal favorites here are kurkuri bhindi, bharwa karela, and arbi.  The menu is decently priced and I'm sure you will love this place. Visit this place for good food which is not heavy on pockets."
3.0,"Good place to have lunch, located opposite forum mall, bangalore. Food is ok. I had thali once, subzi given to thali is OK. Bit expensive to what interior they have."
2.5,"Ordered Lachha paratha, Paneer kolhapuri and butter rotis. Lachha paratha was not at all hot as if it's prepared before taking the order. The Paneer kolhapuri gravy was too thin. The theme for interior designing is chosen quite smartly. It doesn't looks bad and doesn't seem to have costed much to owner as it's theme is typical villagers house. Still, I would like to visit the place one more time to discover what's so good about them, that they are always crowded.  Taste - 2.5/5 Ambience - 3/5 Variety - good enough Cost - Average"
4.5,Gramin is a great Veggie place. They have been quite consistent for a long time. They have Jain options as well. You will come back here for sure. I did :-)
4.5,"Gramin is an absolute delight for vegetarians, who find limited options in bangalore. The location is good, the ambience is good but the besr part about this place is their food and their serving time"
4.0,Gramin~A purely vegetarian restaurant with indeed a homely space and mesmerizing taste! The music creates a right ambiance taking to those back of aged old golden days of soulful voices.. I really liked the place and to my utter surprise while exiting from the same the bheed(waiting) is worth seeing seeking the demand of the food they serve as-well-as pocket-friendly!!! Must eat-Malai Kofta :)
4.5,"Beautiful ambience and great food. Love the way they serve the dishes. Waiting time for a group of 10 was okay, about 15-20 mins at the table on a weekend. It would be advisable to book in advance."
4.0,Desi restaurant. Good to go with family. Homely service. Hygienic environment. Crowded. Serve North Indian. Good to visit again. Yummy food. Spicy Juice.
4.0,"A good place to eat vegetarian food without putting much pressure on your pockets. The food was very tasty and not very spicy. The lassi was a best part and it was worth spending on lassi.  However, its not a go to place for non veg lovers."
3.0,"If you are a vegetarian and do not wish to spend much on the meal then you are at the right place. It is a small place, slightly crammped with village themed decors. It doesn't look very inviting from the face of it but is definitely worth a try. The food is a bit too spicy for my palate but their Gulkand Milkshake works as a saviour everytime I visit them. One interesting thing is you can place your order while standing in the queue. I am giving extra 0.5 for their really fast service!"
4.5,"Pocket Friendly indeed! For a meal without onion and garlic,I always prefer Gramin. Menu has variety and very authentic taste. My all time favorite remains veg handi ,kulcha along with masala butter milk. Infact their desserts are also nice. The only challenge is it is a little crowded at times and one might have to wait a while for the table."
3.5,"I visit Gramin frequently, love the place. Haven for vegetarians like me. But I make it a point not to go there on weekends due to the crowd! You have a lot of options to choose from, and its pocket friendly. You need to mention your preferences to the staff, as I felt that few of the gravies were a little too spicy for my palate. My favorites here are the tava gobi, masala buttermilk, and the yummiest gulkand milk shake. I have not tried their thali though. The mains are quite tasty, portion size is more than enough, that we mostly skip dessert. Ambiance is pleasant and the service is decent."
4.0,Tasty food in budget - that must be the tagline of this restaurant. Malai paneer kofta and masala papad are the must haves. Only downside is the long waiting queue. Highly recommended.
3.5,"One of the few veggie friendly restaurant in Bangalore, due to this my expectation from this place was too high. We were there for lunch and had to wait for around 15minutes for the table, from outside it does look impressive. Ambiance is like a village and they serve food in brass utensil. They do play some really good hindi songs. We ordered while we were waiting for our turn, nice technique. For starters we ordered Paneer kurkure which is like vegetarian roop of chicken tikka. The taste was average, but you will like it if u eat with chutney and pickle. For maincourse we ordered only Paneer Handi, the gravy was thick, quantity was good, but the masala was not good. Some spice dominated the entire taste. Naan were soft and served after you finish your part. Kesar kulfi and gulkand shake were too good. Do order. I hope to try there thali which most of the people there were ordering. The place is not at all expensive too."
4.0,Gramin - went unplanned on a fine Sunday night. To start off the service is pretty excellent and the ambience is  cool  with a village set up. Food brought to the table is presented and crafted really well not to forget they did not compromise on  the taste. Spices and salt all in perfect proportions giving a perfect zing to your tongue. Service is also pretty nice. Overall it was a very good experience. DO VID
4.0,A really nice veg restaurant where I fell in love with the ambiance more than the food. The seating arrangement felt more like home and the food served piping hot went very well with it- quite a comfy homely feeling!
4.5,"I have already been here couple of times. And I wish to go again and again. Its really a food paradise for veg eater's.   Its a small place and not much of posche ambience. The theme suits their restaurant name. Staff service is good. Prices are very normal.  Every dish is just awesome here, be it starters, juices, curries, biriyanis. I just love the food. The Jaljeera served here is one of the best I have tasted ever.  I recommend this place and I am sure you will be satisfied, and vegetarians - I bet you will love their food."
2.0,What is the use of pocket friendly if the food is a mess. I think the restaurant is noticeable jus coz of its location. And yeah do carry scissors if u order naans coz dey r stiff like rubber.
4.5,"Awesome is a word which also feels less to describe about this place. Such beautiful food with such ambience, hats off to the owner and the think tank who have given us such a heaven for the Veggies. Cant define more as words cant speak about the great experience you have.  Must try foods: Everything that exists in the menu :)"
1.0,"This restaurant is just survived by the place it is located in. to begin with, starters were not good, and waiting time is too long between orders. Main course curry was little sour. I would not recommend this restaurant to any friend's."
4.5,Best vegetarian restaurant in Bangalore.  I have had food here umpteen number of times and they have never gone wrong with anything anytime.
3.5,"Aha beautiful veg only restaurant with cute ambience. My friend and i had a Thali. They had 2 curries and dal with rotis, accompanied with little rice. The food tasted great. Then why 3.5? Well i felt the food was little sour even though i like food to be on the sourer side. I felt that over powered the curries. Lassi was served in copper glass which was different and nice. The taste was heavenly. Huge quantity!! My tummy almost blasted :P going back again! Sharath Saligram"
3.0,"It is a nice place to visit once in a while. A decent north Indian food. Ambiance is fine. Nothing great. Its a small place, internally made double floor. Quite some people are seen queuing up. Taste is food is fine to nice. Couple of Menu items are good. I would suggest this place. Not so costly as well. Well waiting area is quite large here, in fact whole of raheja arcade area."
3.5,"Delightful place for vegetarians and Jain, Gramin has some authentic North Indian dishes you wouldn't find in many outlets in Bangalore. Their daals, and paneer dishes are amazing. Tried and loved their Bhindi Masala and Chaas"
4.0,"The group that I usually hangout with are mostly vegetarians. So went here a couple of times for birthday parties and treats. Location is something that is good about this place as it is located bang in the middle of kormangala. In starters bhindi fry is the one most recommended though I believe the quality has came down in last couple of years. Cleanliness is one area that they really need to concentrate on.  The place is very small,  and I really mean very. Hardly enough space for 50 to 60 people. And being very famous in the vegetarian crowd, waiting for 40 mins to an hour especially on weekends is pretty much normal."
3.0,"Being a pure non-vegetarian I always make sure I have my veg at good places. After all the reviews and hype I selected Gramin to treat my taste buds with veg stuff. We had to wait for bout 40 mins which added to the excitement and hype. We ordered Methi Mutter Malai, Paneer Tikka Masala and Tadka Ghee Dal. The food was disappointing. Pretty average stuff which you may get at any north Indian food joint near your place. Certainly had much more expectations but I would refrain myself from visiting this place again. The service was good though and the food was fresh but it lacked the taste I was hoping for."
3.5,"Disclaimer : This is not my final review. Because I strongly feel that i ordered a wrong dish as per my taste.  I went there for Sunday lunch. It was quite crowded. There was a huge waiting queue but the staff was efficient so we got the table in 10-15 mins.  Food - I ordered Veg Seekh Kabab for starter. I didnt like it much. It was too dry. Texture was not good. Expected it to be spicy but it had a mixed flavour of sweet and sour. For Main Course, i ordered Paneer Kolhapuri which seemed to me like a mixed veg served with 6-8 cubes of paneer in it.  Service - Full points for the service. It was prompt and quick.  Light on pocket.  As said I have to try more dishes to judge whether its a thumbs up or thumbs down."
2.5,"We ordered paneer kurkure, bindi fry, some parathas, hari mirchi soda. Except for the soda everything else was bad. the starters kurkure and fry felt like stale food, dint taste fresh. I wouldn't recommend this place because of the waiting time, the cost and quality of food.  I rated 2.5 because the service was courteous and fast."
3.5,"Went to Gramin for dinner..The place is situated inside a shopping arcade on the ground floor.Its a really small place..The ambience resembled that of a typical village in India...We ordered Tawa Paneer,Pudhina Khatta Mittam,Stuffed kulcha,Paneer korma,kofta and gramin Biriyani..It took a lot of time for the main course to come,though the starters came fast..The dishes were all equally good,only the expection that it was very spicy..Overall a good place for veg..."
4.0,Place is must try even for die hard non veg eaters. Food is basic that you eat at your home with a twist. There will always be house full no matter at what time of day you go there.
2.5,"Unnecessary hyped place for the north Indian food in a great location of Koramangala;Here is my own review ;  I saw long queue for this place so i give it try after reading lodz of review on zomoto ,We ordered; Dal makhni - tasteless and loks like ingridents of the dal was cheap Mix veg - not even worth as name sounds some naan , roti .  This place disappointing us a lot on taste as well on pocket too (when taste is Zero than every single penny looks heavy on pocket :P )"
4.0,"I was taken to this place when I really hungry in the evening & didnt wanna have any snacks/pizza/sandwich kinda stuff. Located in the Raheja Arcade close to Forum Mall, Gramin is a pure veg place that serves North Indian Cuisine. Since we had reached really early (7 ish) for dinner, we checked if they had started serving.   The place was empty & we chose to sit on the ground floor. The dcor is ethinic with Indian artifacts adorning the walls & overall the feel is very India Dhabba kinds. The menu is quite elaborate with loads of options in curries/dals & breads. Paneer Kurkure was our selection for the starter. Main course was made of Chana Masala & Phirki Paratha.  The service is really good & the food was served quite fast.  The Paneer Kukure looked like Cigars. Soft & spiced paneer stuffing coated with some crunchy coating served with the green chutney. Really nice    The chana masala was just perfect  not too spicy, not bland, not oily. The Phirki Paratha was a laccha paratha flavored with garlic & chilli powder. Had it for the 1st time & liked it. Ended the meal with a masala chaas.  By the time we finished our meal the place was filling up. A simple & nice place for north indian food with good service.

4.0,"One of the best places for Veg food. Luckily, we never had to wait first more than 15-20mins. Ambience: low chairs and tables with Rajasthani decors.  Starters: Harabhara kabab, bhindi Rajastani are must try. Baby corn masaledar is also good  Beverage: Pidhina khatta mitha has the right amount of pudhina and lemon. One of their best. Main course: wheat base is good, followed by kulchas. They have wide range of curries, almost all of them were decent. I personally like rotis over rice, at this place. Cheers"
4.0,"We went to the place after hearing from other office colleagues. I found the place to be decent and pocket friendly. Its near forum mall. There was waiting for 15 minutes. We were given menu to choose for order meanwhile.  We ordered: Tomato & Corn soup: Tomato soup was good, corn was ok Seekh Kabab: Too good with Green chhutney  Main course: Paneer Onion aachari: It was good Dal Fry: Good Malai Kofta: It was bit on sweet side, But good and all kinds of breads  I would highly recommend the place for its taste and Price. A good place to be with family and friends."
4.0,"This place has a typical 'Gramin' ambience, the glasses , the plates are all very 'Gramin'. The food is very good not  at all spicy, had bhindi fry for starters and I really liked it. Bhindi fry is something you don't get to eat everywhere."
3.5,Good pure veg place with a lot of slightly different dishes for a reasonable price. Village style ambience with copper glasses and utensils but not that well kept as the cushions look a little dirty and old. Decent food with good old hindi songs when you are tight on budget :) PS: Go early around 7 to get seat or wait for a long long time :P
4.5,"If you're a vegetarian and bhindi is one of your favourite vegetables and you don't give a damn about fried or boiled, then you MUST visit gramin and try their bhindi fry and karela fry, because I'm 99.99% sure you're going to absolutely love the way they prepare those two starter dishes! Great ambiance, really good but really spicy food that kind of burnt my tongue, and a well-trained-in-courtesy staff who can handle the queues that form outside! Also, it is very much pocket friendly! I'd definitely give it a must-try in Bangalore if you're looking for good North Indian food with the sweet and spicy taste!"
4.0,Not as mind blowing as the queues on a Sunday afternoon had suggested but a good place for eating veggies nonetheless. Specially liked the paneer kurkure even though it wasn't a visually appealing starter. The other superstar was their phirki paratha. Worth a visit for good north Indian style veggie food.
4.0,Great restaurant good food if you like some thing spicy have piriki parota its really great Menu is really clear the service is also good try thaali if you are not sure
4.0,"if you happen to be passing through kormangla, and you have the hunger pangs and you do not want to spend a bomb then gramin is the place :)With decent ambience and tasty food, you will surely want to visit the place again."
3.5,Nice food. On weekends severely overcrowded. Average wait time of 15 mins. Choley Batureys of this place are something worth trying. Service is sometimes a little slow because of the rush.
4.0,"Nice 'gramin' ambience, good service and reasonable rates. Had Palak Paneer (it's listed in the diet section, so the paneer isn't fried) with Phirki Paratha, which was adequately spicy. Overall, an enjoyable experience."
3.5,"I have been here plenty of times and one thing for sure - It is the best veg restra around koramangla at very low prices. The quality of food is also very good, the only issue is the waiting time. A lot of people queue up to eat here on weekends and its very cheap with the quality of food they serve. Briliiant"
4.5,"I have forgotten the number of times I have visited this restaurant..! Pocket friendly with good food.. Located in prime location too.. Paneer tikka is awesome and chatka gobhi is also one of the best.. Would also suggest to have lassi here.. You can bet homemade food feeling in this restaurant.. Rating- Food - 4.5/5 Service - 4/5 Value for money - 5/5 Will I go again- obviously, multiple times for sure.."
3.0,"Been here multiple times,  the food is good & not very costly.  The options are good,  however have to wait a lot before u get a  chance... Nothing else more to recommend..."
3.5,Budget friendly restaurant with nice ambience and location. Have been here many times and was never disappointed. Only problem- it is located in Raheja Arcade and the security doesn't let u park your vehicle inside! Not a turn off but a small irritant.                                                                 grubitizer.com
3.0,"Heard from a few people that this place is a nirvana for the vegetarians but i must say i would never go back to this place again i suppose. Being in Raheja arcade this place has got a nice ambience to it. The seating arrangement also was a problem for us, since the chairs are very low it was uncomfortable after some time. But then the food is not at all good. The dink are still good, you can try the lassi over here and the mint jazzer as well. The starters were still good especially the platters., but when it comes to main course especially the indian breads, they are really bad. We ordered the bread basket, which had naan, roti, methi roti, miss roti and all and none of them was good. Kari was average, so was the daal and even the paneer was oh ok. But one thing for sure most of us got a stomach ache after having food here.  So, Food - 2.5 Service - 3 Ambiance - 3"
4.0,"The place has that 'gramin' sort of feel. The setup is nothing fancy, but different and nice. Good food for vegetarians - in case you're craving for an economical North Indian meal. Drinks really good - loved pudina khatta meetha. Good portions too. Heads up: There's a lot of waiting and the service is somewhat slow."
4.0,"A definitely must go place for the veggis here, north indian delicacies, worth the wait that you have to. Love the way how its set up and that feeling of an actual village atmosphere. Very good service."
3.5,"Must visit for vegetarians. Be prepared for waiting. Authentic North Indian Food. Delicious Food and drinks! As the name suggests, Village inspired decor."
3.5,"This place is an absolute value for money. I haven't come across a restaurant with cheaper rates for such good taste. As it's located opposite Forum, the location is brilliant. Absolutely love the Nimbu ki Shikanji! If you're looking for amazing north Indian food at pocket friendly prices then this is the best place. Really wish they served non vegetarian though."
4.0,"The lunch experience via thali Having stayed in koramangala for about a decade it is difficult to skip this joint. I renewed my acquaintances today. One thing is for sure: the place is usually packed. There are valid reasons that they have two dozen chairs for waiting people outside.  We ordered the thali which came with Dal, 2 roti, raita , sweet and two curries plus jeera rice. The roti were big and hot, the dal was homely cooked, one sabzi was a little weird with carrots, beans and peas. My Northern originated veg friend was as taken aback by the mix as me. A worthy place for homey lunch in a hundred bux .  There are ample waiters buzzing around n providing great service in a really small place. Though the place has been extended recently it is still tiny.  The decoration is nice and not overdone. I like the copper serving dishes a lot but do not envy the guys having to scrub them couple of times daily.  Go: home food served quickly  Don't : if u have a tendency for claustrophobia  eatwit.me"
3.5,"initially when they started the restaurant which is around 8 years ago, the place pulled a lot of crowd , we hardly found place to sit ever. Food is good. Ambiance is as of a villages's house and yes one can visit for sure. Nothing extraordinary but worth a try for sure!!"
3.5,I am very regular to Gramin. Food is pretty good. You can eat there almost daily. Starters are good. Main Course is average. Service is fast. overall good vegetarian food.
3.5,"This is a wonderful place for veggies. Food is really good. They serve in copper plates and glasses. The place is a bit small and wont be able to accomodate a lot people at the same time. U may need to wait for like 20-30 mins for your table , especially if you go on a weekend. Do try out paneer starters, dal makhni and shikanji :-)."
4.5,"Had been to this place a few days back...If you are a bunch of 3 or 4 and looking for a place to have dinner in kormangala for a good price...this would be an ideal place..Secondly when it comes to food, our orders were dominated with north Indian dishes and was way better than what we expected..And when it comes to ambience, the orders were delivered so swiftly within blink of an eye(sorry for exaggeration :p)...it was a delight...one drawback of this place is it is quite conjusted...apart from that it is worth visiting this place..."
4.0,"its a vegie paradise..... its one of the best places in kormangala for having spicy vegetarian food....beautiful interiors and specially luv the tradional style eating in brass plates and tumbler......food is delicious and quantity wise its ok if u r not for a more than heavy meal...always crowded in the evenings so have to wait atleast 10 mins to get a table .....but wait its worth for.... the staff is courteous and service is quite fast even on a crowded evening...,...its been a while since i last went derr... luking forward to visit once again .....                                                                 fudvoyage.wordpress.com"
4.5,"I had dinner yesterday July 11, 2015 and it had a great food and very quick service and Quite reasonable priced. However not recommended if you are looking for quite place for dinner."
4.0,"Delicious cuisine ! One of the few Veg restaurants serving amazing food. We had Paneer Masala , kaju curry and malai kofta in main course. All of them were good . Also try out lassi. Place is little small and packed with people most of the time , yet the staff is quite efficient and waiting time is less."
4.0,"Good food, good place. The management has managed to go with the name Gramin, and the essence of that is reflected in their interiors, furniture, cutlery. The place is always full with the spicy food lovers that even on a Wednesday i have to wait for sometime. And please don't forget to take cash because Gramin took its name so seriously that their card swipe machines are not working. Hard luck to all those who prefer paying by cards, one including me. Over all, the quality, taste and hygiene are worth the money charged. Kudos!!"
3.5,"I went to this plane with my  friend for dinner on weekday. Hence got a place easily without waiting. Good food,  quick response by the staff. The food quantity was good enough for two people. Talking abt the quality, we ordered paneer onion masala with naan.  I will give a 4 on 5 for the food. The lime shikanji we ordered could have been a little better."
4.5,"Lovely Food. A must place to go for all food lovers, the food is fresh, warm, made from the best spices and masalas. The menu has a wide variety of Sabzis and Curries to choose from.  During busy hours of the day you might find yourself to be waiting as there isnt a lot of seating as the place is quite small but has full points on the ambiance along with a sound music of old Bollywood hits and Classics :D"
4.0,A decent place to savor north indian food served in steel plates and water in brass glasses. You can order s starter with rotis and some vegetables for a budget of 450.
4.0,"Food: The food was simply superb. The starters was really yumiiieeee....quantity wise decent. Other items are usual stuffs like other resturants. People have jaljeera if u like the spicy one. They have their own meal plate,which is quite good if u go there just to fill ur tummy.  Ambience: very small place but organised in very nice way. Place made of bamboo sticks...looks cool  Cost: avrerage 600-700 for 2 people. Best place to go gramin without much plans:)"
4.0,"I've been here twice and both times I've been extremely satisfied with the food.  The first time was a disaster cause I asked for everything to be extra spicy. Ordered a paneer platter for starters, Chilli rotis, a spicy dish with corn and some other vegetables...(sorry, I forgot the name) and a vegetable biriyani. I was over stuffed, and had a burning sensation in my stomach. Stupid much eh? Went there yesterday and ordered the usual paneer platter for starters. The dish comes with ample amounts of capsicum, tomatoes, and onions and you know that these things are good for you!  Ordered a pudina khatta meeta. This drink is AWESOME! I had two in a span of 30 minutes!  For bread, we ordered a basket of rotis. This is quite a good option as it gives you a mixed bag of offerings - tandoori roti, nan, parata, etc.  We ordered a paneer kolhapuri for main course. It was well prepared with a good blend of spices. The amount of onions and lemons served along with the dish is very generous and helps a great deal in digesting the food (not that it's really heavy).  The prices are very friendly on the pocket too. Will definitely visit again. Great place to go for people who'd like to try authentic North Indian food in Koramangala on a budget."
4.0,Small place but great taste... Few veg restaurants serve quality food with varity in menu. Authentic veg food and awsome taste.  Specially veg biryani and North Indian food.
4.5,"Great place to visit for a quick lunch and a paradise for veggie as far as taste is concerned. The place is very conjugated since it is located in Raheja Arcade, Koramangala. In lunch they have an option for Thali which is well organised and sufficient to properly fill the stomach with some tasty food. Sweet Lassi is awesome. Malai kofta is one of the best here which I ever tasted in any restaurant. Earlier I used to think that veggies have a very limited option when considering eating out, but this place has changed my thinking. I don't even remember how many times I have been there."
4.0,A good choice for vegetarians in koramangala which supplies a large variety of dishes in a bucolic atmosphere at a decent rate. The staff is very good and helpful. The amount of wait and the people waiting for a seat might tell how good this place is. Needs a bit of regular cleaning though as the mats on the table look really dirty with spilled over food from months.
2.0,Skip this! There's a tons of places serving authentic North Indian(vegan) food. It doesn't even come close to being average. 2.0 is because I am in good mood ;P
3.0,Good veg food .. only veg resto... Now too highly priced though it's in a posh locality .. but still not to worry if you have missed this place... Just like any other veg hotel nothing specials or must haves... One of those family outing or veg only outing..
3.5,Liked paratas here. Soup was not good. Tikkas are also good. Mostly crowded during friday night and weekend. Servicing is pretty quick. Water is served in copper glasses. Its a good veggies restaurant.
3.0,"One of the very few authentic vegetarian restaurants located in Koramangala. We were here for lunch on a sunday. The place is very small and can have maximum 20 people seated at once. So we ended up waiting for 45 min. This is one main issue that the mgmt should address immediately.   About the food, nothing did I like very much that is worth mentioning here. We ordered for a tomato soup which was pathetic. Starters were decent and the paneer dish which we ordered for main course was not fully cooked. So there we were , left with big disappointment.   Gramin - One  time try."
3.5,Gramin is one place where u can go without thinkng about ur wallet :P and food will also nvr disappoint u ... although area is small but gives u the feel of purana bharath.... :)
3.5,"i am not a veggie.. but i loved the food! spicy indian veg food is a delight here.. the ambiance is good, though they do have a lack of space, and with the queue of people standing outside they do rush you with the eating.. the beverages were good too.. overall a must try for all veggies.."
4.5,"Very good North Indian place for a tasty vegetarian meal. Generally, you have to wait 20-30 minutes before you get a table. One good thing is that you can order your food while you are waiting outside. Seating arrangement is a lil congested but delicious food pretty much makes up for it. They serve a good variety of north Indian gravies and breads. The starters are a bit too spicy and slightly below par compared to the main course. One should definitely try their thali that offers a good number of tasty items @ just 110 bucks. Overall, a very good place for vegetarians. Overall rating 4.5, Location 5, Ambiance 3, Service 4, Quality 4, Taste 5, Value for money 5"
4.0,"Gramin! Pocket friendly north Indian restaurant  around forum mall. Which you can find out bit different infrastructure, they have homely designed infrastructure in the restaurant, where we never feel that we are in some strange restaurant. Coming to the review! Went to lunch, peak  hours where we waited for 30 min literally, because it deserves it. I never felt frustrated  because I know the taste of the restaurant. Had ordered one starters and 4 thali and  different thanda pani both were extremely excellent. And thali over here is a hygienic and good quality. It's worth man! 108 bucks u r getting enough amount of food  u get 3 types of curries ,salad ,sweet ,raita ,2 rotis and kadai of rice  . What else is required for hungry stomach . I recommend this restaurant for all north Indian lovers"
2.5,"I went on a date, good food, good design.  After all they kept looking at us stating inderictly ""when u moving out"" which i really did not appreciate. Everyone has the right to sit at least one hour we sat 30 to 40 mins... Bad idea to bring ur date there"
4.0,Visited here in search of a gud place with Indian cuisine Loved the ambience and the service provided ..food was relishing and well served Kudos!!
4.0,This is among the few veg restaurants I have been to and it's pretty nice. Its a small place not located in some extravagant mall but this place definitely gives you some good experience. Don't do the mistake of visiting this place on weekends cause its fully packed and there is a lot of waiting so much so that they take your orders when you are already in the waiting. The food here too is accurate ad has the perfect taste as an Indian food demands. The service is just too good with very humble waiters.
4.0,"One of the best places to head for food if you are a veggie. I visited here for lunch after we couldn't find an Italian buffet place I had seen in an advertisement.   One of the travails of a good place is it gets very crowded. And to add to that we went for a late lunch as well.   We ordered the paneer platter, garlic chutney, couple of paraphrase and paneer keema pulao. All dishes were extremely well made and had ample portion. The price is also not even expensive. We didn't try any desserts that day.   The only complaint can be there is not much head space in the higher level dining space. So you have to watch your head as well as the waistline during your visits here."
4.0,"Definetly worth visiting a place if near Koramangala. Its one of the best plaves for vegetarian dishes and a place with great starters.   Not a very well decorated place or doesn't have classy interiors but still is a place worth visiting just for the food.  From the soups, to the starters to to main course till the desserts this place is a great place.  Highly recommended place for people"
4.5,Yummmmm !!!!! Is the perfect word.  Try the 'mirch ka salan' simply superb. though of course every other dish is  equally amazing :-) crowded yes. But worth the wait in terms of quality and price :-D
4.0,Have been here on multiple occasions!! If you are going to go on a weekend make sure you are here early to book yourself a table! The food is really good and nice and at the end of the meal one leaves with a satifying burp! It also has a subtle ambience!
4.5,This could be the best choice you make as a vegie! They have Jain special food too!! The best part is you can place your order while you wait and start hogging the minute you get a seat... Really good taste! Slluuurrrppp!!!!
4.5,"This is really nice place to visit once in a while. Good food and very good service. Best part is, they take your orders while you are waiting and hence the service is very fast once you get your seat. Value for money."
3.5,"Its a small place that has good food..their lassi is amazing!!! A must try! Its pretty full most of the times, so a little waiting is always there."
3.5,"On a lazy Sunday afternoon we decided to visit this place for lunch. Known for its vegetarian and cost-effective food Gramin was a decent choice for lunch. It took us half an hour of wait for our turn to come. Fortunately the staff estimated wait time very well. We were asked to note our name in the register and then make an order beforehand. We ordered nimbu shikanji, corn soup, phirky parantha, laccha parantha, gramin veg, daal ghee tadka, steamed rice. Food quality is very good. Service is prompt and responsive. Ambience is ""gramin"", as expected. It cost us around 550 bucks, including taxes, for 2 people. All in all a good dining experience!"
4.0,"having lots of friends as vegetarians, I have been to Gramin on number of occasions and every time I have been there, the place is packed ,Their food is awesome - very authentic North Indian food with wide range of starters, main course, breads and desserts. Their drinks menu is equally awesome. Service at Gramin is a bit slow, but you will enjoy the place when you are visiting with a group of friends or your family. Three things to be aware of: they don't take reservation for tables - you go there, get your name in the list and wait (min wait time 30 mins"
2.0,Heard a lot for this place and finally was able to make it out to try on Sunday night...  Being curious to try this place waiting for 1 hour was really LONG Waiting. Finally gave order 15 minutes before and surprisingly waiting was not ended here.. We had to wait for another 25 mins to have the food on table. Small and tiny place with decent quantity of food. Service was not at all good after seeing that it takes 15 mins more to get 2 rotis and taste was not at all great. Overall a super bad experience.
4.0,"Nice place for vegans.. Just as the place name, it literally gives you village feeling. Phulka n bhindi are pretty popular and they are good too! You need to go through a long waiting queue over weekends but food is worth the wait.."
3.5,Good option for vegetarians. This place is always crowded but the food is good. The only thing that bothers me is that the price is a bit high. Service is good.
4.5,"Amazing place. The starters will are okay, the main course is to die for. Must go if you're in Koramangala. Had the Paneer butter masala with naan along with daal makhani. Loved it."
4.0,I have been coming here since 2011. Best thing about this place is service. Owner himself take orders and suggest best food. Light old bollywood music would always increase the dinning experience here. Ambiance of this place is really good and north indian. A bit small though. Tawa karela in starter is a must try here. Then panner ka salan in main course. This place is completely value for money.
5.0,Just amazing. The prices are untouchable for the quality of food you get.   Fresh lime soda is the best in koramangala and they have nice plates and cups to get the old authentic north Indian feel.   Sometimes you have to queue up but the 30 minutes waiting at peak time are fully worth it.  I can recommend bindhi masala. Just on the point right.
3.5,"Perfect place for veggies. Really good north Indian food and also pocket friendly. Ambience is on an average. Service is good.  I visited this place y'day to have dinner. After reaching there found that there is no parking so parked my vehicle on service road opposite to Punjab grill and came back. They provide thali only for lunch so ordered corn soup, double dal tadka and butter naan. Food was tasty and service was good. so I would like to visit this place again but along-with friends."
4.0,"This is a very pocket friendly restaurant which serves great North Indian food. It is a very crowded place and having been there twice, I had to wait for more than twenty minutes each time to get a table. But the food was totally worth the wait. ""Subz Mirch Do Pyaza"" and ""phirki kulcha"" are really good. ""Nimbu ki shikanji"" and ""mango panna"" were disappointing. On the whole, the restaurant is good but it can be more spacious so that people need not have to wait for so long."
4.0,"I Didn't give it 5 because of the wait time , plus there is no parking space.. But if you are looking for amazing veg food without hurting your pocket- This is the place"
4.5,"Vegetarian s delight..  Good ambience and yummy food to go with it.. Book your tables as the place is always crowded especially for dinners. Would recommend hara bara kabab , Roti s and Koftas..."
4.0,Ideal place for eating at a pure veg. Restaurant. Very good food at a reasonable price!! Loved it. Though it was a bit congested and the service was not up to the mark. Hope they improve their service.
4.0,"Nice veg restaurant... Have been here twice, once had veg thali and second time a paneer dish , daal and jeera rice. Good taste, pocket friendly, enough quantity..No complaints at all :) All the best guys!"
4.5,I went here on a Wednesday afternoon. Place was crowded and as I was with one friend we didn't order a lot but only had a veg platter and a handi biriyani. Both the dishes were succulent and spicy enough. The veg platter has 6 panner pieces of all varieties they serve in the restaurant. It was a very cozy and good experience.
4.5,"A wow restaurant with all the items in the food menu are truly amazing. The experience you get is from the first item you order no matter it is the soup or a cool beverage or a starter, everything is just fab..!! A restaurant worth spending as you don't have to spend much I ordered near by 20 items which were worth 2500 incl. of taxes serve to 7 people, and we had ordered like hell. So all of you it is a must go"
3.5,"To be very honest with you guys, to my taste I feel this the best place to have authentic gramin food with a desi touch. My favourite, sarso da saag makki di roti"
4.0,Very good food.good ambience.tasty and service is faster.                                                                                             Had been twice good food
3.5,"To talk positive abt this place: 1. The vegetarian dishes are really great and delicious. 2.Must try- Baingan ka bartha was really tasty( i tasted this after reading positive reviews abt it in Zomato) 3. Price was reasonable.. around 3.5K for 10 of us.. Great!! 4. Almost all starters were nice  Negative: 1. The place is very small. hence to get a table for 10 we had to wait for around 45 mins. 2. There is no parking place :( we had to park the vehicles in next street and come walking, and it was raining at that time.. so we had to face problems while comin  If i have to ignore the negatives then i will give a 4.5 rating"
4.0,"Very interesting place and I surprisingly enjoyed a complete veg meal. Family who are pure vegetarians visiting led us to go to this place after recommendations from friends. Absolutely loved the food, didn't enjoy the wait too much but the food made up for it! Recommended- the chaurasi dal, chilli Roti, fried karela dish, the jaljeera to begin your meal with,the paneer methi malai and the veg diwani handi. Excellent preparation, wholesome flavours and overall a very very good experience."
3.0,"A small place to enjoy good north indian food with family and friends,service and ambience are nice and there is always rush for seats ,sometimes it gets very crowded due to its popularity in the surrounding and its quite pocket friendly"
3.5,If you wish to relish some home cooked Rajasthani pocket friendly food... Do drop in at Gramin.. Located atthe heart of koramangla..I generally prefer to order the tandoori platter that comprises of few paneer starters.. Simple yet tasty food!!!
3.5,"Vegetarian delight is something that sums up Gramin in Bangalore. The only thing restricts me to rate it higher is the ambiance factor. Food wise Gramin is probably at 4.5.  The afghani daal , the missi roti , the kandhari veg , and not to forget Aam Panha are my favorite"
4.5,"Exactly located opp to the forum study food, the crowd in kormangala is prax3> famous for Rajasthani food. Must try for the special foodies who love north Indian dishes..royal treatment#INDIAN desi style# village adda# mazza agaya/ I now visit on every weekend."
4.0,"My All time favorite for north Indian food. If you like veg north Indian food, this place is must visit . Ambience wise it is kind of Ok , but  taste wise it is simply awesome :)"
4.5,"Well, the relentlessly long queue outside the restaurant is evident enough of the quality food and ambience they provide you inside. If you are looking for a typical North Indian style restaurant with the same aura, service and even utensils, I would suggest going to Gramin instead of any other restaurant even in North India. Yes, it's that good. Only flaw is the waiting time, which is at least 35-40 minutes at the peak hours. Hopefully, these people must be doing something about it. Otherwise, a MUST TRY for all folks out there !!"
4.0,"The name explains it all. Oldies music, amber light, bamboo knitted table covers and simple decors making a peaceful and fun ambiance of the golden era serving food that tingle all your taste buds- If these in your checklist, then Gramin is the place to go. The only veg concept makes this a place to tend to when one gets bored with the heavy meaty meals and steaks. -Quality of ingredients- 5/5 -Flavor in Dishes- 5/5 -Variety- 3/5 -Ambiance- 4/5 - Service- 4/5 -Favorite dish- Rajasthani bhindi fry Foodgasmism- 4/5"
4.5,"This place speaks for itself ! If you are a vegetarian, your search ends here ! Nice ambience and decor. The price is a little on the higher side, but it's not worth it. On weekends u'll always find waiting time on nearly 30-45 mins. Service is great !!"
3.5,"Expenditure/VFM - 500 for two people  Service/ Ambience - The low handwoven seats and bandhni dupattas flanking the walls does transport you to a village on the Rajasthan-Gujarat border. Service is good.  We visited this place on a Saturday afternoon completely famished (waking up late and skipping breakfast of course). So without much thinking we went straight for the thaali. It had 2 tandoor roti, dal fry, 2 sabzi, raita and jeera rice (pic uploaded). Very satisfying meal.  Although this place is touted to have one of the best North Indian cuisines in their menu, the vegetable, dal and even the rice had a healthy amount of 'kadhi patta' and 'mustard seeds' giving it a slightly local flavour. If that doesn't bother you much, its decent food at a decent price."
4.0,"Quick cosy and affordable Dining Experience!!  Head in here for a quick cosy and affordable meal.. The place offers a very good variety for a vegetarian place. Even the Jain options are of wide range. The service is quick and the food tastes really nice. It got an Earthy ambience with some quirky decorations. It's a popular joint among the North Indian population in Bangalore. So drop in early to get a seat easily. I can visit this place any number of times because of the Lassi, Tawa Corn Peas and Butter Chilly Roti.."
5.0,this place is good ..serves tasty north indian dishes for starters we mostly order lasooni paneer dhuadar....itz good and try paneer onion chatka for main course also gramin is in raheja arcade ..u can shop a little after lunch/dinner
3.5,"I've been to this place a couple of times. This restaurant is located at the Raheja Arcade. This place has great food and the service is good too. And the way the food tastes, makes you feel like you are at home. And its very affordable too. Totally worth going to this place."
4.5,Great food !!! Great taste!!!  Well priced ... And quick service !!!  One of the best veg restaurants out there( North Indian).But do reserve a table as it gets packed!!
4.0,"I might hv passed by this restraunt like a 100 times without noticing it. But this one time, i found it nd it was such a delight. Anyhow, coming to the point. This place is a vegetarian delight. A whole no. of varieties in sabjis, dal nd breads. I had ordered dal kolhapuri, handi paneer and tanduri roti. It was really good. Dal and paneer was jst the way i wanted. Hot nd Spicy. And dats not it, their Lassi is a must have. Jst right amount of sweet and not much thick. I loved this place and defintly recommend it."
4.5,"Great Food! Nice Ambiance! Deducted half star for the slow service even after placing the order before we are seated. Been there numerous times, will recommend again and again even though the wait time for the table is like 40-60 minutes!! Bhindi Rajasthani is a must try dish there.."
4.5,I find it among one of the best North Indian pure veg restaurant in Bangalore. Fantastic food and an amazing place. The place is unique and different from a regular fine dine restaurant. I really love the decor and their rajasthani style cutlery. The order is taken while you're waiting for your turn and served as soon as u get your table so that no time is wasted... Come here for a weekday dinner when it's less crowded to enjoy the decor ambience and food...
4.0,"I feel glad that i chose this place to write my 1st review.  To start with the place is situated in the hustle bustle of Kormangala yet it is laid back in it's own way. The food here is extremely delicious (mind you I am a pure non-vegetarian ,yet i loved the food here).This must be one of the few veggie friendly restaurants that I have loved The ambiance is pretty good , makes you feel at home and a special touch of old retro Hindi songs playing in the background soothes your mood.Must try their Lassi and Phudina Khatta Meetha !!  Overall a must visit place if you like North Indian food both for vegetarians as well as non-vegetarians.  P.S. Only con was that they had people waiting outside and the waiter kept us asking if we are done , but on the contrary that's a sign of a good restaurant :)"
4.0,"A small and a beautiful place serving great north indian veg food. The thali is quite filling and reasonably priced. With good taste, old songs being played and a nice decor this place is just perfect for a casual lunch/dinner with family.  The place is mostly crowded on weekends. You might have to wait a while to get your seat.                                                                 worldairies.blogspot.com"
2.5,Food will be served in village style but if you like spices then this is not a place to go for dinner party ! All the gravies had very less and nullable masalas !
4.0,"Been here around 15 times.. Maybe more. The food is almost North Indian style. Ambience is Rajasthani style. Staff is gentle.  Try Harbhara kabab, Veg Handi and Gulkand milkshake..  Last two times I found the taste is missing.  They should not spoil their status I would suggest.. Must try."
4.0,Food 4/5 .. good thali but over hyped. Service 3.5 / 5. . Always crowded and takes time to get a seat.  Ambiance 3.5 / 5. . done well but not comfortable or spacious. Pricing 4/ 5. . good with thali
3.5,Heard about this resto from friends and I and work friend went to eat here. We had tava paneer some lacha parota and vindaloo curry. Panner was nice and soft. Its very busy here andd so we went up stairs. Price wise it is okay. Curry was spicy.
4.5,"Try masala butter milk, aam panna. Tasty and awesome service, nice place. Don't miss it. Chatka Gobi for starters was also good and nice setup"
3.5,"Went there on last Diwali , food is Gud , customer service is also Gud  Plus  1. Gud service 2. Tasty food  Minus  1. Less food quantity  2. Less sitting capacity"
1.5,"Restaurant can accommodate less people hence I n my friends gave our name for table n kept waiting from 9.10 to 10.30 pm. Even before giving us tables they said if we order beforehand while waiting, our food will come soon. So we ordered at around 10, even then after getting table at 10.40,we got our food at 10.55. No AC or even proper fans in all directions. I actually felt ' gramin'. Napkins n tables weren't properly clean.  Positives-food was good and 5 people ate in 1300 rs."
2.5,"Went there because a friend highly recommended the place. We waited in queue for about 20 min and it was not at all worth it.  The ambience is good and so is the service but the food was really not upto the mark. We started by ordering tomato soup which was cold. Then we order paneer handi which was surprisingly sour. Although the waiter offered to change it when we complained, we were already quite full hence asked him for the cheque.  This place is still highly recommended by many but I will certainly not be visiting it again.   Overall Rating:  Food: 2/5  Ambience: 3/5  Service: 4/5"
3.5,"7th May, 2015 at 8pm on a Thursday evening Weekday dinner? You think places will be mostly empty? But no! This place always has most of their tables full which is a sign of a good restaurant. The four of us headed here and ordered for paneer kurkure for starters, aam panna for beverage. For the main course we ordered for baigan bharta, paneer butter masala, butter rotis. The food came quickly. I was not very impressed by the starter and aam panna. But the main course made up for it. The baigan bharta was amazing and it didn't take us long to polish our plates. The ambiance of the place is good with ample seating and good old retro Hindi songs( original) playing at a low volume. Do try it out for north Indian food cravings!"
4.5,ONE OF THE BEST PLACES FOR NORTH-INDIAN VEGETARIAN FOOD - VISITED FOR LUNCH LAST SUNDAY. - LITTLE CROWDED BUT THEY TOOK THE ORDER WHILE WE ARE WAITING - SO AS SOON AS WE ARE SEATED WE WERE SERVED OUR FOOD - QUICK & ATTENTIVE SERVICE - BIT EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT - MY FAMILY LOVED THE FOOD.
3.5,Cheap with good North Indian food... This is one of the place where I visit very often since they serve good North Indian food... But u will always find a big queue.  Hence don't go when u are in a hurry or too hungry.. But once you get a table and give your order they serve it very quickly.... A small place with no focus on the ambience.... But I like their cutlery... In a traditional manner they will serve in copper dishes... I have tried a few vegetables and dal and found to be pretty decent.. Good place to eat....
4.0,"A small place located in raheja arcade which serves North Indian cuisine.   Around 12 of us were there for lunch on a Saturday. We had to wait for 15 minutes to get our table. I was quite amazed by the way the tables were arranged in a small place to accommodate more people. Also, the orders were taken during the wait. A smart way to serve more customers.  Coming to the food, we had babycorn starters which was decent. The chutney served was really yummy. Authentic sweet lassi is served here. I found the palak paneer spicy. The peas pulav could have been better. The best thing about this place is the staff. They are very friendly and patient. The food was served quickly though the place was crowded. Overall a good experience!"
3.0,It was not upto the hype i received from my frnds. Harabhara kebab was good. The tomato soup here was not good at all. Paneer tikka was too spicy. Everything here is overpriced. I liked the gramin biryani though.
4.5,"It's a good place to have North Indian vegetarian food,  it's always crowded even around 10 or 11pm. You might have to wait to get the seat but they won't disappoint you  because they will take the order while you are waiting and once you get the seat they will serve it right away. Value for money"
2.5,Its busy and happening place in Koramangala. Good place for veggies. Need to wait in a long que to get inside if you visiting in weekend. Ambience is not that great but looks fine. Service is fast & quick. Finally we found waiters who can speak local language i.e kannada in koramangala. Been many times but the taste remains same all time..can be recommond for othrs..
3.5,Enjoyed it in the first visit but it was reduced by more the half in the second visit. Decent place to have dinner with family.  Good value for money
4.0,"Good service - order is taken while you are waiting and served as soon as you get the table. Tasty food, good quality. Special mention - Gulkand shake in the end, it was yummy. I would say it's a must have. Overall happy happy :)"
3.0,"didn't live up to past expectations when I visited 2 weeks ago.  The paneer dhuadaar starter was average. It's kept around a small bowl of charcoal embers to give it the namesake effect, but the effect is namesake at best! Malai kofta was average at best. The kofta was too bland and the gravy was not smooth enough paneer kolhapuri was good veg biriyani was below average. rice felt like plastic and tasted raw. There was too much of spice powder as opposed to infused spice in the vegetables or rice Something as simple as boondi raita was average. the curd used wasn't great butter naan was soaked in butter and too thin to enjoy  Didn't seem as clean as it should be for the reputation and crowd that it gets. We had to wait for 30 minutes for this!"
4.5,"This is our go-to place each time we crave good north indian food in blore. It is an unpretentious place, with a sole purpose to feed you well. The decor transports you to an age where glass doors and automated light dimmers did not exist. It is simple, yet welcoming, making those of you who are too cool to check out the rural side of out country, get a taste of it here. It claims to not use any food additives and preservatives, which is great, if true. Start with the jaljeera. Go on to the bhindi kurkure and corn masaledar as starters. Simply delicious. Main course has a wide variety of options- we havnt been dissatisfied with any so far. The rose and gulkand lassi are perfect accompaniments to your meal. Soul food for the desi at hearts."
4.0,Ambience- nice place to hang out wid frnds. The big table on the loft is awesome. Food- nice northi veg food. Bhindi packs a punch. Noth indian beverages are almost bang on. Indian breads are well made. Price- worth the price.  Must visit
4.0,"Whenever u feel to crave for perfect North Indian food, this place will be on top always for sure .We waited in long queue for approx. 30 min and it was worth it, as food was really tasty.  The ambience is good with some paintings on wall, with good service that makes u happy, people are quite humble and makes u feel comfortable all the time.  We ordered Crispy Bhindi that was recommended by one my friend and it was simply outstanding, have not eaten anything before even in north India, its there Uniqueness for sure.  For main course we ordered Dal Makhani, Handi Panner and Grahmin Kofta with some butter Nans and Rotis, everything was good not spicy at all.  This place is value for money sure shot, would love to go again and would highly recommend this place to everyone.  Overall Rating:  Food: 4.5/5  Ambience: 3/5  Service: 4/5"
4.0,Simple and nicely maintained.  Ambience is good. Food quality and quantity both are wonderful.  Service is nicely done. Staff arrive to your table before you think of calling them.  Simple and decent place to have some good food.
3.5,"Good food treat for veggie..... I don't prefer Veg food much, But here taste is good. Enough quantity , cheap as well... I have been here twice in last one month..."
4.0,"A veggie only place located diagonally opposite Fennys, before Punjab Grill, Gramin serves up some unique dishes. The guava ki subzi caught my eye and was one of tue first things i placed the order for, however it was not available that day. The health conscious have an option to choose from the diet menu, which has a variety of 6 dishes to choose from, none seeming boring at all! We ordered a chatka gobi, corn soup, masala chaas, pudina khata meetha, masala papad, phirki roti and banjara paneer korma. The soup was simple and a small portion was served up. The chatka gobi had a little spice and subtle sourness to it, as the name suggested. The phirki roti was a masala roti, very interesting and im sure that would taste great with curd. The banjara paneer, made in a mint sauce had the fresh spice of green chillies. The masala chaas was not too spicy and the pudina khata meetha was very refreshing. The spice level for me was a tad high but the great part was it did not come from excess masalas but rather from green chillies was good. What i loved the most about the food was it wasn't like the atypical restaurant food served up with excess masalas and oil but rather more home style in that respect, yet offering a taste which was not common to find and dishes that were very unique."
4.5,Being new to Bangalore I always crave for good Punjabi food...nd one of our frnds took us to grahmins...and I absolutely luved it...we tried dal makhani.. Gramins kofta..absolutely delicious ? ...we had to wait for around 20min to get a table but that was totally worth it ... Do visit for good veg food ?
3.5,"The near village type sitting experience, a renewed definition of vegetarian food, the forever crowdedness( an irritating issue) , their dal fry, their paneer kulcha, diwani handi, lassi are some reasons you should always visit this place. The last time I went here with my mom ( I told her its served the best veg food), I was made to wait for an hour for a table although I was supposed to wait for 20 mins only and it made my mom hate it. I personally like the food there, cant get better veg, but the staff behaviour, their forgetfulness, and their attitude, has decreased my affinity towards the restaurant. If you are willing to eat hot food, go early and reserve. If you know you ll be late and the food will be cold and incomplete, dont visit, they ll make this dream come true."
3.5,"Been here once with my friends, pretty decent food. Taste is good. Paneer was very tender and soft. Service is okay! Location is pretty cool. Once a visit is recommended if you are very much interested in vegetarian north Indian food then a perfect place for you."
3.5,"Decent vegetarian food. They definitely don't disappoint you with the taste. The peas starter and the baby corn were perfectly cooked. So were the curries and the naans went just fine with them. One nice thing were the drinks, the traditional aam panna was simply yumm!! Will definitely visit again."
5.0,"excellent food - 5/5 courteous waiters - 5/5 Very good service - 5/5 Very economical - 4.5/5 Decent ambience - 4/5  A must go to place for everyone - friends, family if looking for a proper authentic north indian food"
5.0,"I have been eating at Gramin since a long time and have frequented this place recently a lot more. Gramin seems to be back again with delicious veg food. Their service has always been extremely good. However, somewhere the food quality had dropped in between. Now they are consistently serving great quality food. Lahsooni Paneer Dhuandar has been my favourite starter here and almost all veg dishes are good. Even the veg thali on weekdays lunch time tastes good. They also manage the long waiting queues very well - serving starters and drinks while you wait."
4.0,Great place.. Pocket friendly and awesome food.. Nothing so flashy and over done.. There is always a long queue outside this place.. There is some local market in the waiting area so that is not an issue you can send your time.. Staff is Very friendly.. Guy taking your order gives you right advice what you should order and what not and in how much quantity.. And not like other places where they ask you to order more and more.. Service is tad slow but I guess that is only because they are full al the time.. All n all great place for an awesome food..
3.5,"Typical north Indian restaurant with decent food and service. I found it bit small and we could hear everything other people were talking in next table. Ordered a Gobi chilli which was not that great. Then main course were fine but I found them both normal. I had heard my friends calling it awesome and best place to hangout but I personally didn't find it so. But its best for its prices and location. If you are finding a place to have a quick bite near forum, koamangala and if you are a vegetarian then you can certainly go here."
4.0,Gr8 taste.... pocket friendly ... fast served hot food.... i really liked d environment ...Gramin ... i gve u 4 stars.... more menu option shld b added ...
4.0,Perfect blend of Indian spices..The food has the authentic taste and flavour of Indian cooking...Every bite overflows with desi tadka...The food does justice to the name...and the ambience gives a homely feel to the customer...all in all a great dining experience!!the paneer tikka is a must try...It just melts in your mouth....A good place to find yummy vegetarian food!!
4.5,"Went on sunday noon with 2 of my friends and landed exactly at 12.45, which means that you don't have to wait to enter!!  Ordered harabara kabab and crispy babycorn, the baby corn starter is really amazing and incredible in taste. Had this with mint chutney which is very tender and light.  The main course we ordered really spicy items both in curries and roti's for which we regretted later of spiciness ;)  The must try items of Roti's which you cant find anywhere else are,  1. Makhi ki roti. (good only when its piping hot) 2. Phirki kulcha (loaded with spice, can be eaten alone without any sides) 3. Butter chilly roti  Kaju curry is okay of taste and panner tikka masala are the curries that we have ordered. Both the gravies are not of too good and also panner is not so soft.  Over all its worth visit and great value for money and taste. :)"
4.0,"Gramin, a pure vegetarian restaurant is located on the ground floor of raheja towers Kormangala. The place is small, but they have neatly arranged tables to accommodate more people. You might find it conjusted. There might be waiting during busy days. Service is really good and pleasant. Food is served in traditional thali plate. Undoubtedly its one of the best pure vegetarian restaurants in the town. Prices are so cheap and quantity is good. They serve thandai and aam panna and they have managed to maintain the authentic taste. Hara bara kebab is one of the best starters here. Besides you will find every other known north indian dishes in the menu. Vegetarians mark it for your next visit.                                                                  myhungertales.wordpress.com"
3.0,Good place for economical lunch. they serve all veg Thalis. Need to concentrate on the hygiene part. Overall an average place for quick corporate lunch.
4.0,A heaven for veggie north Indian food..the menu's got variety like no other veggie place ever...they even serve a lime soda with hari Mirch..a must go place for a veggie north Indian food lover and they can crank up the spice level on request
3.5,"Well well well. A pure veg place that I actually liked. It takes time to get a place and the place is always crowded. The service isn't too great either. But when it comes to food, this place is 5/5. Many varieties and great taste for all items."
4.0,"I think it was long due to visit this place. On a rainy night , when you decide to have chaas and you know that the best place is right across the street ,you never really care how bad is the rain going to be. This place has been in the list since 2years. Everytime I have decided to visit this place, I will see a long queue and crowd in raheja which is so unlikely considering that the arcade is no longer a popular spot. So while going through the menu , we got a bit confused as this place offers so much for indian cuisine. We decided to order bhindi masala and baby corn subji along with phulka and bombay biriyani. I can vouch for the biriyani for those who love a bit spicy and tangy taste. Its definitely a must try for the vegeterian lovers. Lassi and chaas are must here."
3.0,"nice and decent ambience though looks old, food was ok ok. was more concerned about the hygiene because I had to clean plates myself using tissues."
4.5,This restaurant makes you go back to the old village times ambience full marks food best in town service never upset you the only restaurant where vegetarian food is worth the penny always in the top of list for vegetarian food
4.0,"This restuarant is located inside Raheja Arcade. The restaurant provides a aunthentic north Indian ambience. I was really impressed how they managed to decorate a limited space so well.  I think if you really want to taste North Indian cuisine, this is the place to visit. They provide so many dishes, so much variety. There is an authentic taste to the food. I loved their pudina lime drink. It was so refreshing.  The staff are way too attentive I felt. This place gets really crowded in the evening. If you have to, its really worth the wait to eat at this place.  I would really love to come to this place to let my taste buds enjoy proper North Indian food."
1.5,Quality of food has reduced significantly. I visited this place after 1.5 year expecting same taste but Gramin has let down my expectations.
3.0,"Thou vegetarians of Bangalore shalt feast in Koramangala's neat little eat-out very aptly called 'Gramin.' Variety of choices on the menu, decent portions, service and crowd (mostly of the office-goers in the afternoon) and good food. On top of this, the rates are also justified. The three of us had decided to choose this place for our vegetarian Tuesday lunch, and Tawa Paneer Babycorn (the amount of curry leaves in this can be lessened for sure!) accompanied with a Green Chutney for starters with Jaljeera and Shikanji followed by Veg Kadai, Laccha Paratha, Garlic Naan (had some religious amount of garlic!), Stuffed Kulcha and a Mixed Raita is what we settled with. The beverages were the star, hands down and all the other items were all equal in taste. None of them competed with the other to be the better of the lot! A cool choice with a feel of the village (though they can think of expanding it a little bit more as it gets stuffy with loads of people!) Does no harm once a while, just make sure you reach before time as it is crowded and while you eat too, there are people already waiting!"
3.5,"One place you can go to show off Bangalore to your friends and family who visit for the first time. Roti and Sabzi Mirch do pyaza is heavenly. Masala Butter milk is a MUST HAVE. Too bad that they don't serve thaali on weekends, that's the best thing in the whole menu. Advance booking is essential."
3.5,"So that happens only once in a blue moon when I endup having dinner with a vegan friend, but Grammin did not disappoint me.Their paneer garlic starter was good . For mains we ordered some paneer gravy which lived upto expectation. We also ordered their Grammin special biryani, honestly I did not like it, its a green colored biryani and I felt the rice was half cooked. - with Niranjana Mathur"
4.0,I usually don't go out for eating a vegetarian food but if I have to then Gramin will top the list. The food is tasty and within the budget. I love the chaach and kulcha here. It is a family restaurant and hence crowded. You have to wait for table on weekends but the wait is worth it.
3.0,It's a village ambience that greets you with chairs and tables all designed to give you a good experience.. The food is good.. Lassi is the best.. Must try
4.0,"I can never be bored of this place. A pure vegetarian restaurant and yet its on the top of my list. Located in Kormanagla, it gets filled quite easily on weekends but the complex its located in, has a variety of things that can help you pass time while your table's getting ready. The food is awesome. I have never had better lassi anywhere else in Bangalore. Maybe I have not had lassi in too many places. But still.... We usually have the Malai Methi Paneer which is a lil sweet but I love the sweetness n white gravies with Paneer. The ambience is also that of a Village like its name. They even serve a thali during lunch on weekdays which I tried once and was very happy about.  I will keep coming here till I can whenever I crave vegetarian food."
4.5,"A perfect veg outlet, Gramin is one of those rare gems in a sea of non-veg hangouts. Gramin has signature kebabs and good biryani. The raitas a good too."
4.0,"If you are a veggie , love Punjabi food and work/live in Koramangala, you could not have missed this place! Love the jaljeera and Gobi Chatka. Ambience is rustic in keeping with the name and theme of the restaurant. Reasonably priced, it is a great place to have weekday lunch parties or to satiate the veggie hunger pangs"
3.5,"Nice ambience, courteous staff and very good food. Decided to try this given the reviews I heard from people like the best panjabi food. Yes the food was very good but not close to the hype around it. But looking at the prices, it is great value for money !!"
4.0,"Great place to be here.    Specially if you are a vegetarian or in a mood to have vegie food,  I can say go and try this out...  On weekend there will be waiting time around 20-45 minutes,  in the mean time they take the order and  serve you as soon you get a table.  Food is quite good and its enough amount to be shared with 2 people per dish."
4.0,Delicious and simple food served at a very low cost. I went with my friends for a dinner and every dish we ordered was tasty. We ate a lot and the bill was only 250 per head. And the food was amazing we felt so content.
4.5,"Visited this quite a number of times. Not to be missed by Pure Vegetarians.One of the best Vegetarian food in Bangalore. You also have option of Jain style cooking for some of the items in the menu. Most of the items taste like home made food. A good value for money also.Service is a bit average, sometimes you have to wait for along time. Overall a great experience."
3.0,"Had been to gramin today fr lunch. We waited outside fr sometime and the shop opend at 12 pm sharp. The food was ok ok. Not bad, we ordered corn soup the quantity was very lil n it was all blended together like a paste with some corn seeds, the serving was very late and all the curries was nt completely cooked, tomatoes were still raw. The menu is kinda confusing as every item has been given a different name. Malai curry was waterish n did taste good.. But uts quit a popular place in koramangala but ver tiny n the seating is nt comfortable."
1.5,"Gramin used to be one of the best vegetarian restaurants till like a few years ago. Ended up there yesterday night for dinner after a long time. The long waiting made me think the food must still be good. Sadly, that is not true. We order hara bhara kebab and malai paneer tikka. They were average at best. What is worse is that they were the best part of the email. The main course was quite bad. The only flavour I got from the mixed vegetable as well as the paneer handi was chilli. Both the veggies were oily and spicy and not much else. Overall the food was quite disappointing and the waiter could have controlled his eagerness to get us out so he could place the next round. Alas! One of the few good vegetarian places in Blore has also lost its charm."
4.0,"I had heard a lot about this place, it lived up to its expectation! Authentic North Indian food . It was delicious, even though it's been a long time since I visited there the memory still gets my mouth watered ... :P"
1.5,Food was undoubtedly nice but too much delay in serving and rude behavior of a staff member which gave us a negative feeling of that place .
3.5,"I used to be a regular at Raheja Arcade for those ladies clothes stall and always happened to notice the never-ending queue outside Gramin. As I like my meat over veggies anyday, never gave Gramin a chance. Come Lent, and I had no place to go to. Finally, I had to give in! Food is simply lip-smacking and their Tandoor Paneer Platter is a must try. Oh that Green Chutney for sides, is absolutely delicious!                                                                 instagram.com"
1.0,"I went on Sunday, actually my friend suggest this restaurant. He said they serve best north Indian cuisine. but that is depend. First of all don't go on Weekends, You'll have to wait at least 30-60 min. for a table. lots of people waiting, bcoz it's one of certain restaurant who serves only Veg. I ordered Paneer butter masala n Baigan bharta, and both are worst, they used tomato sauce in Paneer butter masala insted of real tomato."
4.0,"Me and a friend accidentally stumbled upon this restaurant when we had some work in the same building. The 'Zomato people's choice' label stuck on it's wall prompted us to try it out!   Although it was a weekday afternoon, there was a bit of a crowd. The place has a simple yet captivating ambiance. I was pretty impressed. The menu items were reasonably priced as well.   Initially we ordered Corn Soup and Harabhara Kabab. The corn soup had a somewhat weird taste, although it wasn't bad. The kabas were really good, though. For the main course, we opted for Vegetable Makhani and a variety of Indian breads. The side dish had a slightly sour taste, which I personally liked a lot. But it may not really appeal to everyone. The breads were quite soft and fluffy, which definitely made them taste good. But one minor annoyance was that the stuffed kulcha was filled with cheese, instead of vegetables which is the usual norm. Finally, we ordered fresh lime soda, which was really chilled and refreshing.   The total bill came up to around 650 including taxes, which we felt was quite ok. The service was a bit on the slower side, but not to the extent of causing frustration. I do recommend this place for it's unique charm.   Food - 4/5 Ambiance - 4/5 Service - 3.5/5 Value for money - 5/5 Hygiene - 4/5 Overall - 4/5"
3.5,"I'm a veggie and Im proud of it. Yahoooooooo........ one of the first few eateries in Koramangala. This place has been around right from the days when Forum did not even come to be in Koramangala. Food - 4.5 Ambiance - 5 (just because this place has been a theme restaurant even from before I could spell ambiance properly) Pricing - 4 And then there is trouble in paradise. Service - 1 (as many of our tomato patrons have said before, just because we don't have a ""0"" rating) The most rude management and service personnel i have met so far. All in all , I hate going back here."
3.5,Been here many times when feel like having home food I do visit here pricing is ok food tastes good . The part which I don't like is have to wait for long and there is no good arrangements for that
4.0,This is the place to head when looking for cheap affordable north Indian food. They have a lot of variety in the menu which Will never bore you.  The copper cutlery adds to the charm.  Overall a nice dining experience.
3.0,"Highly over rated  Went with the impression of having a lovely dinner, but none of the dishes kicked starting from starters till main course. Might be because of heavily crowded and very rush hour visit. I stand lil disappointed."
4.0,Best place to have vegetarian food in Bangalore. Had been their many times and have never been disappointed. There is no other place in the city which gives you so many varieties in veg at such less price and that too without compromising taste.
5.0,"I'd rate it 5 on 5. Cos I can't get enough of the food here. Every time I visit this place , its pure joy. Its rustic ambience will get to you, cos even water tastes good here ( served in brass vessels) I always pitied vegetarians, but this place will put the best non- vegetarian joints to shame.  And must have the aam panna. Feels like the drink of the gods. Amruth."
4.0,Nothing short of a heaven for vegetarians in Bangalore! Loved this place. We had to wait for a while before we were ushered in a small cozy place with rajasthani decor. Good food. Loved the chaas!! Pocket friendly and gives you a feel of ghar ka khana. Recommended for vegetarians!!
5.0,"One more location with Sasta,Sunder,Tikaoo in a very appreciative way the ambience is very simple which go goes very well with the food. The food feels home made hats off to chef, and hats of too to their pricing as well a thali @ 110 all incl something very difficult these days, the must try dishes  the thali a whole some satisfying meal, lassi(sweet and savory),am panna,masala papad ,dal,and bhendi fry."
1.0,"Yesterday I visited this place with my friends and my experience was more then pathetic ... Not one single item was good , we ordered Kaju masala , malai kofata , hydrabadi paneer in main corse , harabhara kabab , paneercorn in starter ... It was so damn pathetic that I can not explain ...   Don't know because of Sunday quality was not good or it is regular taste , I will never visit this place that is for sure .."
3.0,Good veg place but didnt like what i ordered.  Dal tadka didnt taste good as the jeera was completly burnt and could taste that while eating with butter roti. Next main course item was paneer tadka which had foul taste and reported the same to the person attending us. They were sorry that i didnt like their food. In starters bhindi fry was good and masala corn too.  Overall a 3. Probably skeptical visiting this place again.  Cheers
4.0,Place for vegetarian foodies  Its a small nice place close to forum... I liked the place...  *Ambience : small place but pretty nicely arranged 3.5/5 * food : loved it 4.5/5  *value for money : 5/5 *service: 3/5 (during peak hours u gotto wait)  Would definitely visit again.. (Y)
3.5,The place is buzzing with people at the weekend. The look and feel of the place is very true to the name of the place. Liked the masala papad and sweet lime soda. They were prefect. Also had subz mirch and dal makhani. They were average. Overall liked the place.
4.5,Vintage setting of the restaurant is too good. Very good restaurant for veggies. Each and every dish is full of flavours and the quantity is gooood. Service is fast. Suggestions given by them are generally a delight. Their thali is heavy too. It is totally worth going!
5.0,"Waaahh... i.e. the only word that will come out from the mouth of any veggie person who is tired of finding out a good vegetarian restaurant. Located at kormangla, near forum mall this place has an easy reach. If you have a craving for a food menu which takes you to Rajasthan, Delhi or Punjab you have to visit this place. They have dishes which are difficult to find out in Bangalore.  For lunch, thali is the best. But my personal favourite there is Methi malai mutter, give it a try at least once and you will experience what a good vegetarian traditional food is like. Ambience I must say is not great but is above average, but price what you pay as a package of all of this is too less. So, r u still deciding then you are a confused mind..."
4.5,Kamaal ka khana!!. Service is too good. The prices are very reasonable.  The place is overwhelming with its traditional theme. Music ? awesome...a truly bollywood era of 80's and 90's.  veggies plz visit dis restaurant.
4.0,am a regular to this place. totally a haven for veg food. nice ambience. wish they had a thali for dinner. keep missing out on that one. very efficient and friendly service
4.0,"Good place for all Veggies . Food Tasty,tat manager uncle recommendation r good. Pick anything from the list wud b good.Wud definately visit again   To improve: Tables shud b neat and clean."
3.5,"One of the best time I had in Bangalore was here! We took a Korean friend and an American friend here. They were amazed to see a menu full of vegetarian dishes. Felt so proud to be able to take them on an indian food journey through the help of Gramin. Great food although I felt the quantity was less. The ambience is home like, perfect for a place serving Indian food. I felt the service needs to improve.The waiters seemed grumpy and didnot seem welcoming. All in all a good place."
3.0,simple humble pure veg restaurant which i dont like all that much but have been there a few times . On a recent visit after like ages i realized they haven't changed the food much and the quality has been maintained . overall a decent place which serves decnt food but then again i am not going to come here again anytime soon as i can have all of the menu at home itself
3.0,Since most of my friends are vegetarian we went here to eat dinner a Sunday evening and the food was just about alright. We ordered very usual dishes like butter nan and paneer curry.
4.0,"First thing, you need to wait. More seats for waiting than inside the restaurant. Staff are very courteous who even recommend you food suiting your likings. The food, it will make all the wait, worth it. Every dish you order, you're bound to like it.   P.S - when there's spicy symbol next to a dish, it IS very spicy.   Food - 5 Ambience - 4  Price - 4 Service - 3"
4.0,Food was good. Service was great. It was not oily or spicy. It is great place for vegetarians.  Aam juice was excellent. Seating arrangement is authentic. Its a clean restaurant.
1.0,Horrible experience. We went for team lunch and each one of us end up with stomach upset. One of my colleagues got skin rashes due to the food...huh!!!  No more vists to this place and wouldn't recommend it.
3.0,"So finally went to this pure veg place which has been much talked about by my veggie friends. I'm not a fan of veg food but dont mind it occasionally. We ordered quite a few stuff and genuinely, this place isn't that great. We ordered for panned butter masala which dint taste like expected. The naan and kulchas were very rubbery. Yes, we munched on these maida based breads and even reached a point where we gulped the kulchas as our mouths hurt. The baby corn chatpata was okay and so was the sheekh kabab. The north Thali looked great and was filling although I genuinely felt that the quantity was less. My rating for this hotel mainly goes for the ambience. If you are in koramangala and really hungry, I suggest you think twice. Especially if you have a vehicle! It's very difficult to find parking around that area. But surely this place is pocket friendly!"
4.0,Nice veg food. Decent ambience. Quick service but one needs to wait a lot (at least 30 min)before entering inside on weekends. One of very few places in Kormangala where you can get nice veg foodat reasonable cost.
3.5,Gramin is at raheja arcade near forum mall signal is a complete veg paradise. The food here is good. I visit almost every Monday and love to eat here. Over all its paradise for vegetarians.
4.5,I have been to this place twice and must say I loved the food..  The ambience like a village enjoying desi khana.. I will surely visit you guys again! Recommend friends to try out this place for sure and you'll love north indian food! Most of their dishes are spicy which I guess not good for everyone. As kids were unable to eat anything properly. But the best thing is they hv options for Jain food which is very rare in Bangalore.
4.5,Love the food. And the service and the ambience.. Gramin is veggie lovers paradise. And specially Bhindi Rajasthani is too good to resist...
4.0,"Favourite for veggies. Great food. Went almost 10 times. Taste has never changed here. If you dont have option for veggies, then go for it. They have changed ambience, new ambience is good."
3.5,Good place if you want to have budget veg dinner ..  Only bad part is there waiting; if you go over weekend be ready to wait outside for 15-30 mins.
4.0,"Want to feel an aura of a typical Indian village, this place should be your first choice. Great snacks, delicious food and at a nominal price."
4.0,"Its my all time fvrt rest...coz it serves good quality vegetarian food at reasonable price.But last time when i gave a visit to d rest..i ordered paneer handi..but that was not at all good in taste..some unusual spice made d gravy sour..we then complained d rest manager..although he replaced d gravy...bt that too was not up to d mark.U can give a try to Pineapple raita, kaju masala, jaljeera.These are good in taste. Ambience defines d name of the rest. Overall its a Pocket friendly and good choice fr vegetarians."
4.5,"Gramin truly it is in terms of ambience.Located at Kormangala, perfect place for north Indian cuisine. We had been here for Saturday's dinner. Enjoying the atmosphere along with hot rotis is a pleasure. It was around 10 pm we reached the place. I was delighted with the sight of menu card. Menu card is designed in a unique way to signify their theme.  I got a feel like I entered place in countryside to have desi khaana. Let me go through the dishes: Baby Corn Starter: We started with baby corn, it was crispy and tasted great. You love to have more. Dal Tadka: This was served in small bucket, the very glimpse was tempting. Tastes great and is perfect North Indian style. Roti basket:We chose roti basket, it was combination of all rotis, it is worth and best part is you can try all. Lassi: Served once again desi tumbler and without lassi dinner would be incomplete. Sweet lassi tasted awesome.  Service is quick and good. Additionally, staff is attentive. On top of it, it is pocket friendly. Worth being here.  Overall:  Taste: 4.5/5  Ambience: 4.5/5  Service: 4.25/5  Quality: 4.5/5  VFM: 4.5/5"
2.0,"The place, now, is a mere shadow of its glorious past. I used to love this place a few years back but now it feels like they are dragging their feet in terms of food preparation efforts. May be I had a unusually bad experience but both mine and my friends' gulkand drink had stones in them. Yes stones in two drinks. The food quality was just average and definitely not worth the price tag."
3.5,"Heard from a friend of us about this place .This  is  a vegetarian restaurant with a traditional ambience. When we went there,the place was so crowded that waiter came n took our order when we were waiting. But food is great here. A proper north Indian restaurant . you would be amazed to see the prices.. Very reasonable ,pocket friendly."
5.0,Very good food at very much affordable price!! Maintains good consistency with taste and quality. Very good hospitality. Garlic Kulchas are best here.
4.0,"I m a complete non veg, But this place rocks. Me and my friends were so freaky  stuffed. A person like me who had no interest in veg foods enjoyed this place a lot"
4.0,"Nice place to visit for the veggies. Place will always be crowded, you need to wait in a long queue. Food tastes great. Delicious Punjabi food. Amongst the best panner butter masala I have had.   The menu is exhaustive and you get to choose from a wide variety. The staff were sweet and prompt.  Prices are extremely competitive - true value for money.  Ambiance: Its a small place with a mezzanine and a typically village like ambiance. The seating is a little uncomfortable because of the height of the sofas. Still it was nice experience."
4.0,Good place to have authentic North Indian foods. First of all the theme of the restaurant is a classic hut which looks good with few suitable properties like old style fans. And coming to food right from the starters till dessert they don't disappoint you. Paneer starters are quite awesome here. You even get some of the items in the menu in special Jain preparation. Nimbu ki shikanji is my all time favorite of this restaurant. All around a great restaurant and a good place to go out for a meal with your friends or special ones in Koramangala. It's proximity to Forum makes it a hotspot.
4.0,One of the best vegetarian restaurants in bangalore... Ordered paneer tikka masala which was top notch but dal makhani is not dat good overall amazing experience.. Were 10th in waiting but got inside in like just 2 mins.
3.0,"I went  here  with friends who were veggies and maybe since I had very high expectations,  this place didn't seem that  great.  The  seating  was congested when we last visited which  was really long time back and the wait  time was really long.  Taste 3 Ambience 2 Service 3"
4.5,Home for Vegetarians !! Authentic RAJASTHANI food !! Starters are generally spicy but can request them to prepare it according to your requirement. Economical but you will have to wait for atleast  30 min to get a table .
4.0,"It's nice place close to forum mall ,koramangla if you are craving pure veg north Indian food. The food tastes really good and its light on the pocket so its somewhere you can visit again and again and never get tired of it. Though generally you have to wait for a while to get a table on the weekends as its a small place but the good thing is that you can order and wait and the food will be ready and served hot when you get your table."
4.0,Can never get enough of this place! Have been here a lot of times and still wanting to go back to gorge on their yummy delicious food! My favourite is lassoni paneer tikka! Perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection! This is a must try for all paneer lovers! And the thali is also very good and so worth it! Just for around 110 rs u get rice roti 3 subzi sweet and curds! Perfect meal at anytime of the day! It is a must try for their thali or al a carte! The best part about gramin is their ambience! Its themed according to the rajasthani setup and the best thing is you can listen to the yesteryear evergreen songs thats played all the while! A really perfect place for a good satisfied lunch or dinner. Although on weekends prior bookings is recommended!
4.0,"A good quality food at a reasonable price. Food was indeed a delicious and healthy. Service was also good. The facilities were kept clean. Good seating and a pleasing ambiance. Over all, Oustanding location, Great atmosphere, Good Food, Remarkable service and one of those MUST VISIT restaurants in koramangala."
3.5,"Though Grahmin is a much hyped about place , I found the food mediocre . Perhaps the only plus is the prices are moderate , but I rather prefer to eat at Anand Sweets nearby. Also , they have to keep the quality in check , as once i ended up with a stomach upset after my visit here. The starters were good though."
4.5,Best north Indian vegetarian restaurant in Bangalore. Their service is quick and they are value for money. Only thing that I would like to add is this place is over crowded during weekends and you may have to wait sometime for half an hour.
5.0,"Visited this place after a long time since I was out of Bangalore for almost 6 years. This was one of my favourite restaurant. I was so glad that the taste has not changed a bit, it is fabulous as always. I am fond of spicy food so ordered vindaloo with parathas. It was superb as always. There is lot of waiting so make sure you either make reservations or have spare time."
4.0,"A good place for everyone who wants to eat Jain food. Recently my mom was here who strictly wanted to eat Jain food. Most of the dishes they serve have an option of jain i.e. without onion or garlic and ensured while taking the order. Food had a good taste, at pretty reasonable price. The staff is well mannered. And they provide prompt service. The only thing is they can work a little on the ambience.  I would suggest you to go anytime you feel like having good north Indian food  Be sure to wait for your turn if going on weekends ."
4.5,I love visiting this place.  Its a vegetarians heaven. Has tried almost all the dishes off the menu.. Favorite being hara bhara kabab.. Would visit as many more times I  can.
3.5,A World altogether decked up with traditional folk decor in the hustle & bustle of Kormangala ... Had to wait for an hour on a Sunday afternoon and the long waiting queue sure made me even more curious about this rather petite place ... Ordered the thali having waited for an hour my appetite was in no mood for any more wait ... Food was decent if not extra ordinary ... The ambience & the setting makes up for the mediocre food & service ... Try it once !
3.5,If you are a veggie and looking for North Indian food to fill your empty tummy with good taste and quantity this is the place to be...  Have been to the place couple of times good food and service... Keep an 30min\hour margin between you and your food in weekends.... DAMN WAITING...
4.0,I would begin by saying there was lot of people waiting outside...i went at 3pm for lunch..and it was damn crowded.. We ordered gramin veg and handi panner...gramin veg was nice but panner was harder than usual..lassi is great..overall very reasonable and good food..i would go there to try more things again.
4.0,"Sasta sundar tikau. That's hw i wd describe gramin. Delicious punjabi food. Amgst the best panner butter masala i ve had. The lassi was so light and yet tasty. They hv a lot of options in wheat based rotis which is quite impressive. Price - very reasonable fr the food and location. Service was quick. We mst hv completed everything in 25 mins. In short , a gud place to hv healthy and reasonable food in a short span f tym."
4.0,The place is located in Raheja arcade (the lane right opposite to forum). Its a complete vegetarian delight.. I have been here quite sometimes and never once have I been disappointed.the place is somewhat small for the number of people visiting it. The staff here is friendly and prompt.One of my all time favorite things here is nimbu ki shikanji.. Its chilled and amazing (specially for people who miss ghar ka nimbu pani) some of the other recommended things are paneer tikka masala (nice vegetable and a change from regular butter paneer and stuff) and stuffed kulcha..Everything here is very good (avoid mirchi ka salan if not a huge mirchi fan.. and baingan bharta tooo.. )and the place is light on pocket too..Its a Must Visit place.. :D
4.0,"We planned to have dinner at koramangala and as a few friends with us were vegetarians and we decided to try out Grameen. I am a non veg lover, but I loved every dish we had at Grameen. The quantities were very good. The pricing was decent. The ambience was nice and the menu was designed well. I loved the variety of sabji on offer. I would surely plan a visit again soon."
4.0,A pure vegetarian restaurant which serves good indian food. Have always seen a Que in this place. Its a small place with a mezzanine and a typically village like ambiance. The seating is a little uncomfortable because of the height of the sofas. Have been here a lot of times and have always liked the food. You can never go wrong in whatever you order. But the food can be spicy at times. I really like the lassi and the mango panna here. The service is quick and the prices are also quite affordable. Good place for good Indian food:)
3.5,"One of the best vegetarian restaurant I have been in Koramangala. The ambience and the village setup is so good that you get the actual village home feeling when you are having the food. I like way they server the food here.  If you have a vegetarian friend like me, this is the best place to treat him/her."
4.0,This is a village themed restaurant serving pure veg north indian food. Have been there twice and they have never disappointed.. A vast variety of vegetarian options to choose from.   Definitely try the bhindi kurkuri and the lassi here.. The food here is very good and very cheap on ur pockets too..
3.5,"It's a kind of Village / Dhabba Seating & Setting, It is always crowded , and you can place your order before you get to sit.  Food = it was just satisfactory, not much as rated  Average Taste and surely it won't be heavy on the pocket Cos, prices are competitive - true value for money Staff is very courteous  > Suggestion: Do inform them for less spicy flavors  Unfortunately, I couldn't manage to take the pics, I just have the snapshot of bill ;P"
1.0,Seriously speaking I dint lyk any of the items served here... Taste is not so kool.. I Recommend pple not to go here. The oly thg which I lyk here is the onions which is served with meal...????????
4.0,"When it comes treating your hard core veg friend, Gramin is one such place to be. Good food... Lovely ambiance and decor... quick service... u name it they have it.Starting from Jaljeera.. kulchas ..naans... everything is good..quantity of Thanda thanda section is good and filling but curries are little less in quantity.Price is affordable but mind u... better go early on sat or Sunday for lunch as there is always a long waiting...However they will let u decide what u wanna eat even when u are waiting for ur food...They used to have discounts earlier for take always but am not sure if they are still running such offers...Overall place is pocket friendly..good food..good ambiance.. well located.. but i always face parking problem... can anyone guide me for that:)... rest enjoy Gramin to the fullest."
4.5,"Went here on a Saturday for lunch with 2 north Indian friends. As expected the place had a Q and we were asked to give our order along with the reservation for our table. After about 20 mins we got a table on the ground floor of the restaurant. After we sat down the drinks came immediately. The masala soda was plain masala in a chilled soda and the sweet lassi were the usual stuff available at most places but the pudhina khatta meetha was something new to me. All the flavors were perfect(sweet,sour and the pudhina) with neither overpowering the other. All the drinks were pretty chilled which was enjoyable after a long walk in the hot sun!  For starters we got bhindi anardhana( stir fried bhindi with pomegranate seeds) and stuffed tandoori aloo both of which were ok ok with respect to flavor but I like the tandoori aloo better which had Lil more spice and salt in it than the bhindi which lacked both and had excess oil in it.  For the main course we got tandoori roti(soft medium sized rotis which were not over done) with Dal ghee tadka which was perfect in every sense! Wish I could get this recipe and try it out myself. On weekends they dont serve the thali which is also pretty popular! One of the best places for authentic north indian food with reasonable prices!"
4.0,"Not a big fan of veg dishes... But I would love to visit this place over and over again... A small place serving some of the most delicious dishes, always filled with chirping ppl... The only thing I would recommend is to expand their area, as the ones who have visited this place,like us, would love to come back for more, like us :)"
4.0,Gramin is not as the name suggests...it is a very good veg restaurant in locality near forum and it is very reasonable as well.  We tried hare bhare kabab and panner tikka in starters ..both were good .  Main course is also pretty good .  Overall food was tasty.  Add ons were old Hindi song .which were icing on cake.  Staff were OK but few are childish and can't understand properly..  Overall rating - 4 ambience .. 3.5 Food 4.5
4.5,A perfect place to eat and dine with family. Provides good authentic Rajasthani/North Indian food. And it's cheap as well. Only thing is they don't accept cards.
5.0,"Exhilarating. All the raw Indian flavours and spices dance in your mouth. When there's onion, mango pickle and lemon to supplement your colourful butter /garlic kulcha with palak paneer, what more do you need?  I personally thought North Indian sabzis and rotis were too heavy a meal (and roti usually being rubber like hard) but gramin makes u fall in love with North Indian cuisine."
3.5,"Gramin is a haven for vegetarians in a place where meat rules. A family friendly place with a nice cosy ambience and a pocket friendly menu, gramin continues to attract a steady flow of patrons."
4.0,"The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Rose lassi was brilliant! We ordered thaali, which is actually suffient for  two people! Also, the place that gives the feel of a village courtesy the decorations!"
3.5,"Being a vegetarian, I am always hunting for places solely dedicated to veg cuisine. I am glad that I stumbled upon gramin. Been thrice to this lovely place and all the three visits were memorable. Good food at great prices. This is Gramin. The menu is exhaustive and you get to choose from a wide variety. The staff were sweet and prompt. It didn't take much time to get our order. The food is good but it can always be better. The Achari gobi was real spicy! But the rice items were quite tasty. Also liked the sarson da saag. The drinks are limited though.  Overall its a good place for all of those who want it to be 100% veg!"
4.0,An awesome place for pure vegetarians... the taste is good....has a homey feel...and location wise placed in the hrt of koramangala...worth visiting....
1.0,"It's simply one if the worst forms of North Indian food I have had. The place qualifies as the last option one can opt for if the Koramangala area and just can't think of any other place that can serve decent veg food. The quality, taste and service is/are appalling. I failed to understand how that place could be full and command a waiting with such low standards.  Friends suggested it's value for money; but food without any distinctive taste is zero value for money as far as I am concerned. A big avoid!"
2.5,"I read all the reviews over here and expected too much from the restaurant. Honestly I don't think it is as good as it is rated. The curries for the rotis and naan were just okay.  I'd say many darshinis on bangalore make better curious. Starters however were good. Kababs were tasty. One thing to remember. NEVER ORDER A CURD RICE here. Since some of the dinner mates intended to end with a plate of curd rice we ordered two plates and boy, they are the worst I've ever had.  Go to this place for starters and don't expect too good curries from them.   Favorite food from my dinner.  1. Veg Sheek Kabab 2. Butter Chilli Roti"
2.5,"I frankly don't understand the long queue and high rating of gramin. I hv been here twice, and always ended up with a big disappointment. Well i understand the ambience is very good, but i have eaten better food in one third of the price. Serving average food in fancy looking thalis doesn't make it delicious for me! This restaurant is just ok. I ll go here again if all the other good veg restaurants shut down in Koramangala. Ohh my 500 bucks. Sigh!"
3.5,"I have mixed reviews about this place. First time when I visited the place, food was good but saw few cockroaches moving here and there.. Second time when I visited this place, I felt that food was too spicy and was lacking the same taste"
4.0,"Its difficult to surmise in words, the quality and taste of food one gets here and it wouldn't do justice to it if it were to be expressed in words. The place to go to if one wants to spend time with friends over delicious vegetarian food. The long waiting time to get a table is a major downer though."
4.0,Veggie lovers you gotta visit this place.. Authentic veggie restaurant with variety of yummy dishes :) thali is awesome or you can go individually.. Pocket friendly :) great taste :) overall - great food for veggies :)
3.0,"The ambient feel of the place replicates a Dhaba but lack the authentic appeal. Staff is very courteous as they offered us a comfortable space and briefed on the offering.  We ordered a Paneer dish and a daal with an assorted set of bread. The food is very spicy (even though ordered less spicy based on staff suggestion) and would be a challenge for many taste buds. Cutlery is a desperate attempt to replicate a dhaba but fails to impress. Breads were nice and so was the dessert offered.  Ambiance: 3/5 Food: 3.5/5 (too spicy) Staff: 4/5  Suggestion: Work on the food offering with less spicy options. Please change the cutlery if you are really serious on authentic feel. Menu is too big in size; might be a challenge to handle more than 2 on a table. Lastly, please don't use low quality mouth fresher as its a mood spoiler."
3.5,"Value for money food if u r a veggie....For typical rest of us (non-veg), there are lot many other places to try before u r being forced to this place..! The ambiance was reasonable, though the music was sad. Apart from tomato soup, my best part of the meal were hot gulab jamuns......defintely worth trying!! Overall a reasonable experience for a ""not so hungry"" and north Indian person."
3.5,"Went here with friends for having Veg Food due to some festive/auspicious reason. The restaurant is very small but its always busy. We had to wait for 15-20 mins outside, at that time itself they provided the menu card to order the food. After we got the seat it took around 20 mins more for them to serve the food. The sweet lassi was awesome. Rice and Dal anyone can make delicious. Gramin Veg curry, palak paneer were good. So soft Stuffed kulchas, I never had before!!  Must Try: Bengan ka Bharta  Caution: The price range is bit on higher side."
3.5,"one of the best place to have vegetarian food in Kormangala. have visited this place lot of times in the past 2-3 months. The prices are affordable. You feel it as a home-made food. The only problem with this restaurant is its a small place. Its tough getting a table here on weekends. Lot of crowd, but it is worth to wait."
4.0,Taste wise is quite good for veges but this place is always crowed & you have to wait for min 25m to get a table. Ambience is ok there is nothing special in that. They are following Indian village theme. I liked every thing here except soup & desert. They are not having variety in desert & soups are pure herbal.
4.0,Pure Veg. Good Taste. Superb North Indian. Simple Village theme. Amazing Service. Light on the budget. We went there on a busy Saturday evening and were asked to give the first order while still waiting for the table. As soon as we got the table the order was ready. Overall a wonderful experience. Must try: Rajasthani Bhindi and Lassi.
2.5,"We went there on a sunday afternoon, there was waiting, finally after 15 mins we got the table. We had already mentioned to the person taking the order that we dont want anything too spicy, we were suggested a few items: 1. Neembu Shikanji - It was nice but too sweet 2. Anjeer Milkshake - was really nice 3. Gramin Dal- Ohh man, it was sooooooo super spicy, beyond imagination and like one previous revier mentioned it had the samabhar flavor. They did change it and got dal fry, but it was just something you get in every home. 4. Kadai Paneer - was again superrr spicy 5. Tava Gobi - It was deep fried, I dont know why they called it 'tava' gobi, and was spicy and oily 6. Bread basket - it was nice  If you are not into super spicy stuff,, please avoid this place. The service was fine though."
3.5,"The food was just great. We ordered some paneer and malai kofta and both were delicious. The ambiance was average but the place was small so had to wait like 45 minutes for our table. The service was good too. Place is quite pocket friendly except the ""rotis"". If you are a pure veggie (even if u are not), a visit to this place is recommended."
3.5,Being a vegetarian - it 's always a delight to see a stand alone veg Restaurent surviving . Coming to food - it was not exceptional but was good enough to get a better rating . Mirchi ka Sala - we ordered was very good and was worth highlighting . Bread basket had usual combination . Prices are extremely competitive - true value for money. Service was efficient . Overall - a positive experience .
4.0,"A great place for vegetarians . Always packed and one needs to wait to get the seats but, worth the wait .  A value for money place,decent ambience and absolutely brilliant service with courteous staff !"
1.5,Ek dum bakwas!! Not at all worth the money and time. They need to change the chef right away! Just because it's in a posh location they will serve anything.
1.0,"Had a takeaway. Ordered paneer butter masala, the worst I ever had. The gravy had taste of tamarind in it and was brownish. Paneer was not fresh and it tasted horrible. Rotis were really thick and stodgy. Left a very bad taste in my mouth."
3.5,pur veg restaurants are hard to find in bangalore...gramin do justice with the items listed in menu except the bread part... may be its my hard luck or chef wa not in good mood whenever i visited Gramin but its always the burnt one... except that experience with gramin had been pleasand... curries are tasty however less in portion...no parking for gramin can be a negative point otherwise must try for veg lovers... value for money...
2.5,NEEED to wait lot of time but good FOOOD ND taste. Liked it but slow service . ND no proper sittng place . No proper servic . Only the fooood taste is GOOD
2.5,"So we have heard a lot about this place from our veggie friends, and so one day we decided to give our non veg taste buds a break. We decided to go on Saturday, and being a weekend, the place was way too crowded. We got a place to sit after 35 min and we were hungry to grab anything we can. Mind you, you've to place your order before you get to sit, I believe that's done to control the crowd, but for me it's no good, coz I really like to sit, catch a breath and than go about ordering. However, we ordered tandoori stuffed aloo, dal kolhapuri, baby corn vindaloo and garlic Naan. Once we got the seat, the foods were served pretty quickly. First came the tandoori stuffed aloo, our starter and BANG! First impression of the so called great restaurant floored as we bit into our first piece. It was cold, seems like it was made long time back. We called the waiter to express our concern, and he told he will replace it. Waited for another 10 min to finally get the tandoori item from which u can actually see some smoke coming. Taste was good, and it was filling. Next was dal kolhapuri and baby corn vindaloo, both were so so, but a hungry stomach makes even the worst food taste good. Babycorn vindaloo was having potato pieces, and I hope the chef really kmows the real meaning of vindaloo :). Overall, a pocket friendly place, but will I visit again? I don't think so."
4.0,Went here on a Friday night with my friends. The place was quite full but we were lucky to get a table soon. A very simple simple with a village theme. They have very low height chairs which is something unique. Coming on the menu we ordered hara bhara kabab and malai paneer tikka for starters. where the paneer tikka was good the kabab was just ok. For the main course they have way too many options. We ordered a paneer preparation and 'Daal Afgani'. I must say daal was awesome.  The service was quite good and the waiter serve the food in the plates (unexpected for such kind of restaurant).  Highly recommended if looking to fill your tummy with some nice north indian food that does not cost heavy on your pocket ;)
4.0,"if you are a veggie this is your place to go. Ethnic decor, friendly service. You might have to wait for a table but they make sure your order goes in even while you are waiting. Food is no disappointment."
3.5,We were lucky we reached this restaurant early for lunch ( as it got pretty crowded in just 15 minutes after we arrived ).  A very nice little restaurant. Service is super fast !  Tomato soup was very tasty and served hot in cute little bowls.  The stuffed aloo was amazing. It was worth the money spent ..very very yummy..  The main course - Methi kulcha and roti were also good..  The gravies - Paneer Vindaloo and Cashew corn curry were average. The Paneer pieces in the paneer vindaloo were kind of chewy.. There were lots of cashews in the cashew gravy...Taste was average..  But the starters were really amazing.. Loved it !
3.5,The appetizers were a little dry. But the curries and parathas were excellent. It's a small place where customers need to walk with a little caution or you will end hitting another human being or the wall.
2.5,Butter khulcha was amazing but the kadhai paneer sucked. The paneer used was also not that fresh.. chatni dint taste like chatni at all. The service was fast and quick and I managed to get a seat within 5 minutes or so.
3.0,"I wanted to go here from pretty long time. so finally made it on sat for a dinner.. the place was so crowded with so many people waiting outside for there turn. the menu cards are placed outside also. We managed to get a seat early as we were only two.. the place is divided into 2 portions the upper & lower. the place seems to be lil conjugated.. tables are really small even for 2 ppl..as thalis are big.. we had babycorn masala for starter it was good.. soup was also good.. nimbu shikhanj were different & tasted good. we ordered garlic kulcha it was ok ok, i mean it wasn't hot at all. paneer kadai was not up to the mark. zeera rice was as cold as curd rice. service is fast. ambiance is not as expected.. nothing much seems to be as gramin which means village."
3.5,its a good attempt at providing a good experience for the vegetarians in what the name suggests style . their harabhara kabab is one of the best that i have had . I would like them to have better looking thalis.
3.5,A nice place for veggies as I am a vegetarian. You get authentic north Indian food with a nice village kind of ambience. Lassi is too good here. I also have tried Acchari paneer (must have).
2.5,"Expected a lot from Gramin after reading awesome reviews here but was highly disappointed. I did a take away of methi parantha,dal makhani and paneer butter masala. To my utter shock,both the gravies were so so spicy and mind u i can have spicy food but how on earth paneer butter masala n dal makhani be so spicy? Very strange. The paranthas were okay in taste nothing great. Packaging was good. Prices are reasonable"
4.0,"One of the oldest restaurant in koramangala.  Heavily crowded.   Quick service.  Very nice food, Always enjoyed the food.   Avoid on weekends.  Parking pain in the back.  No reservation."
3.5,"A tiny little place tucked away inside raheja arcade, gramin is a little village like restaurant with all the promises of a typical gramin experience.   On a rather hungry evening with very little time to spare and a small budget  I wanted to eat some North Indian food , pop comes Gramin to my mind.  We enter to smiling faces and a nice village like atmosphere, and super hungry.   The order consisted of crispy Bhindi masala as a starter which was crispy indeed and a big bowl FULL. We kept munching on it and over a period realised it was tasty but had to much of chat powder in it. We ate it all nevertheless.   The next order was chaas. This was tasty and fit the bill perfect.  Main course was rotis and methi malai mattar.  Rotis were nice and soft.   When you order methi malAi matar one would imagine a cashew based white gravy that is creamy and a tad sweet. What reached our table however was a light brown dish with some spices in it. This was a let down in comparison to what was expected.  That said it was a quick meal and it fit the budget really well.  It costed us around Rs. 400 all inclusive for the above.  So If your around koramangala, want a quick north India joint and  want it to be light on the pocket, head to gramin and eat your fill.  Happy eating."
3.5,"Lunch Saviour!   For a person working in Koramangala, making a choice for is also a difficult one considering an array of options.   Veg Thali @ Gramin for Rs.110 is my lunch saviour. Quick service &Good Food. Gulab Jamun in Dessert with Filling Veg n Roti&Rice. Not a bad option at all.   Pls see I have tried only Thali over there."
4.5,"Nice ambience, delicious food and decent pricing. But during weekends, it is difficult to get a seat for yourself because lots of people visit. Yet I would love to visit again! :)"
4.0,"Well, no need to describe about this place as it is well known for food lovers and being favourite  for the ages.   When my veggie friend and I  planned to go out for food in Koramangla, Gramin was immediate  option  for both of us! After reaching the place on Sunday  evening 8PM, was little disappointed  to see the huge crowd, but highly appreciate  the way management  organizing the things.   Quickly noted down the name for seat booking and given a slot for 9 PM, asked us give the order by 8:45 and promptly have taken and our table we got by 9 and without further delay got the food served within  5-10 minutes. Was lill worried  whether  they would  take the further order, but to our surprise they've come to us before we finishing  our food and served us without  making us waited.  Kudos to Gramin for managing  such a big crowd without  disappointing and properly organizing! Really appreciate  it. Food was also delicious  and totally enjoyed it:)!"
4.5,Very nice food and ambience. Remember don't keep very high hope regarding ambience becoz it has a village look from inside. Service is good and friendly people. Prices are reasonable.
1.5,Very bad food. The babycorn masalader and gramin biryani was horrible. The babycorn starter had a taste of rotten type
4.5,Excellent food quality Ambience was good. Decent crowd. No much decoration. Good service. Space is a problem. Seats not comfortable. Fruit juice not available.
3.0,"Decent Vegetarian Food  POSITIVES - + Average Tasting Vegetarian Food + Decent Ambience and Decor  NEGATIVES - - Was served stale capsicums once - Food is a little overrated  Gramin is really popular among Vegetarians for being a restaurant that serves good Veg food for cheap prices. The place is usually very crowded on most days. The decor is decent and they've attempted to make the place look like a nice Dhaba. The food is served in copper kadhais and dal is served in cute little buckets. Everything including the plates and glasses are also made of copper which gives it a nice folky look.  Few of the dishes I've tried so far here are - Babycorn Masaledar appetiser - By the name, it sounds like the babycorn would be covered in some spicy Indian masala. But I was taken aback when the appetiser looked and tasted like Babycorn Manchurian! It tasted decent. - Paneer Tandoor Platter - This platter comes with three different types of Paneer Tikkas. The White (Malai) Masala, the Green Masala and the Red (Tikka) Masala. I liked the Paneer Tikka much better than the other two. The Paneer could've been much softer though. - Paneer Tikka Masala - It was incredibly spicy! My mouth was on fire. The paneer was very tender and nice. But on the other hand, the capsicum they had put in the paneer tikka was clearly very stale and had gone bad. My friends shared the same opinion. Its the worst experience to be served stale food. - Handi Paneer Masala - A Spicy and Sour type of gravy that tastes just okay. - Veg Kofta - Decent sweet and savoury gravy with huge kofta balls that are tasty but a little too dry. - Dal Makhni - The dal was average and quite bland. Very runny for a Dal Makhni. - Veg Kolhapuri - Again, really very spicy, but decent in taste. - Dal Afghani - Much better option for Black Dal than the Dal Makhni. This is a more thicker, tastier and richer version of their Dal Makhni. - The Rotis, Kulchas and Naans are were well made. - Fresh lime juice - Tastes great with the food. Well made with the right amount of sugar and salt.  Gramin to me is a place that serves average tasting vegetarian food at low prices. If you're a pure vegetarian, you could try the place out. But if you're a non vegetarian, then you have a lot of options around the area. You needn't settle for average tasting vegetarian food!"
4.0,"Very nice place for food. Has a decent ambience and is quite cheap too. Pure vegetarian restaurants are hard to find and this is one of them. A must go place I say. Do reserve a place before reaching. Generally the place is full in weekends. Try Aloo chatpata, and other spicy starters. They are nice."
4.0,Tasty north Indian veg food. The rotis and curries are good. Given the location the price is also OK. The wait period is a cause of irritation.
3.5,"This is a good place for people looking for decent, easy-on-the-pocket, North Indian vegetarian food. The location is pretty great too. For the same reasons you'll always find it crowded. Once you do manage to get a table though, the service is pretty fast. They also have thali options for lunch which will you really fill you up! The seating arrangements can be improved. Not the most comfortable chairs in this place.  Food 3/5 Ambience 3/5 Service 4/5 Value for money 5/5"
3.5,"If you are a vegetarian like and then Gramin should should be their in you check-list. Very nice food, economic cost, unique interiors and plates. Waiting times are bit disappointing."
4.0,"Good, authentic, non oily, very tasty, vegetarian food. The tawa bhindi and tawa karela are a delight to eat. Rotis and sabjis are excellent. Jaljeera was good,but shikandi was a disappointing as it was toooo sweet. Achari paneer and dal were awesome. The bill was not heavy on the pocket. Awerage rates for awesome homely food.."
4.0,Compact cosy place. Definitely a value for money. The rest rooms and washing area needs improvement.  The Bhindi Rajasthani is a must try. The gravy was a little spicy.  Food 4/5 Ambience 4/5 Service 3/5 Value for money 5/5
5.0,the best vegetarian food that u can get in bangalore......... enjoy the meal with friends and family.......  i always like the north Indian thali... love the food here..

5.0,"Amazing authentic veg place!   If you want to experience a dhaba style pure vegetarian restaurant, this is the place to go!   Not only is the food amazing, the service is better than I've seen anywhere. They are very good at handling crowds and we got really prompt service.   Food 5/5 Ambience 4.5/5 Service 5/5 Value for money 5/5  Would surely recommend this place for some good vegetarian food."
4.5,"A very authentic vegetarian Indian restaurant.. A huge line outside the restaurant on holidays... Great food with good service & amazing music, set up & presentation is the wow factor of this restaurant... Quantity a little on the low side but a value for money..."
3.5,"Good food very tasty, some nice varieties in starters. Ambience is not good, high in taste. Service is bit slow. Overall value for money, good."
4.0,"Located bang in the middle of koramangala its known for its rajasthani rustic ambience. I have visited this place ever since I was a student and its a surprise that the quality of food remains just the same till this day. The must try here is tawa gobi and masala jaljeera. Beleive me, the food is worth the long wait and very light on the pocket."
3.5,"Took my colleagues out for treating them for completing 5 years working with my current employer.  First impression : small cosy place, minimalist interiors, to the point. Great to visit with friends and family.   Service: not very fast, like any dining  Staff: friendly   Menu: abundent  Food quality: very good  Taste: i would say above average, not great. Roti: average  Paneer: great.  Overall feeling : worth visiting once when its not over crowded like the fellow reviewers say."
4.0,"This delicious veg restaurant is located in Raheja Arcade, Koramangala. Went there with a group of friends.  The ambiance is okay. But something different from the usual veg restaurants. Gives an authentic feel. They have low tables and chairs. There is old Hindi music being played in the background. A complete Indian feel. They serve you all their food and drinks in copper vessels.  The service is great. Quick in serving you. Very friendly and courteous as well. No problems here.  The food is simply finger lickin' good! We started off with Masala Papad. Then, we ordered various dishes like Paneer Vindaloo, Paneer Baby Corn Jalfraizi, Veg Handi and loads of Butter Kulchas. Each dish was delicious and the Paneer was really soft as well. Good portions are served too. We ended with Sweet Lassi, Jaljeera and Nimbu Ki Shikanji and also Gulab Jamoons! Ended on a sweet note.  Such amazing food at even incredible prices! It surely is a pocket friendly restaurant.  Overall Experience :  Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Ambiance - 3/5 Price - 4/5"
3.5,"Well being a hardcore non-veg, i happened to visit this place cuz of my veggie frnds.. They aren't equipped with many tables and we had to wait in queue to have our meal..The food was quite good..place could be kept cleaner than it is.. Personally i loved the masala butter milk.. Would not mind visiting this place again to relish veg food.."
4.5,One of the great vegetarian restaurants in bangalore. ... Pleasant ambience with great food. ... must have are the bhindi fry and daal and the naans....
3.5,A Vegetarian's paradise. Been here couple of times for delectable vegetarian preparations. Decor is very Indianised and cosy.   Try paneer dishes.
4.0,"One of the best place in Kormangala to have the vegetarian delicacies. When i visited, good old Hindi songs were being played. That made the ambience really cool. There might be waiting queue, if you are visiting at late evenings. Do visit, won't disappoint you!"
4.0,"Whatta food man! A super place to have a veg food. Though the looks of the place is not so good, the food is awesome here. Well cooked, properly served and literally mouth watering foods. Paneer was so soft, veg daal was so yummy, veg sheek kebab awas like ""please can we have unlimited serving"". Such a yummy taste, veg could not be so better like this. A must visit place for veg lovers."
4.0,"Eating here is an experience. The food is simply amazing! I go to this place time and again, wait in the long queue, get my table, and start gorging on their delicacies! The best item is the Gulkand. The decor is out of this world, or perhaps 'Gramin', with tribal art and handicrafts peppered all around. The tumblers too are copper coated. They have paid a lot of attention to details, every aspect of your experience is looked into. The layout is a little cramped for me, and the queue at times drive me away from there. Items are reasonably priced considering it's location. Can't wait to go again!"
4.5,"Must visit if you want good authentic North Indian (veg) food in Bangalore. Been two weeks since I moved here from Delhi. Had been craving North Indian food. A friend introduced me to this place. Have already visited it twice in three days. Their Nimbu Shikanji (lemonade) is the best I've ever had.  The place is always full,  so it's a good idea to make prior reservations if visiting during peak hours. Light on the pocket.  They could improve their service though. Tend to take quite long in serving food.  All-in-all, a good experience."
2.5,"Located inside the Raheja Arcade, Gramin is perennially crowded. So reserve a table in advance if you feel the absolute urge to visit the restaurant. Been there at least 4 times till date and have felt that the standards have been steadily deteriorating every single time!  Food  used to be good ages back. Last Sunday, we tried out the babycorn-paneer chatpata and tandoori aloo. Found the aloo dish a tad better than the former. The dishes looked appetizing, but just wished they scored high on the taste quotient. The lassis were an absolute delight  both the normal variant and the kesar one. Nothing great to write about the rotis. Phirki kulcha and the veg curry ensured we shed some tears, thanks to the spice levels. Paneer butter masala was just alright!  Service  was disappointing this time. Agree it was a Sunday night and there were people thronging the place, but that should not mean that guests should put up with bad service. We had to remind them several times when the food got delayed. The person in charge was more than eager to hand over the bill when I had to stop him short and ask for the dessert options! :)  Also if they could do something about those ultra low chairs? Difficult when you have elders and a pregnant lady in the gang and you are left with only those kind of chairs to get comfortable on!"
3.5,"One of the better restaurants for pure vegetarians in Bangalore. This place will not only satisfy you with right kind of food but also won't be heavy on the pocket. Located in the Raheja Arcade in Kormangala, it is very close to Forum Mall. Parking could be an issue so make full use of Forum and walk down here.  Almost all the sabzis I had were fine, from plain bhindi (who orders Bhindi in restaurants, but let's not get into that) to the ubiquitous Paneer Butter Masalam they all were tasty. Variety of breads and to top the food with Jaljeera or Lassi will make you full and won't hurt your expenses too much.  Since it is located at a busy place, make sure you reach there on time otherwise huge queues could make you wait. My OCD for Hindi keeps me troubled as it is called Gramin and not Grameen."
1.0,The worst food I have ever tasted.
3.0,"Awesome atmosphere....good is ok You ll love those low lying chairs...its a small place,ul tend up waiting for almost 20~30mins.Theme of the restuarant is appreciable"
4.0,"Amazing pure veg food, the dal and bhindi are amazing!! Great place and priced very well too!! Even the beverages are well prepared!! Been a regular here for quite a while and have never been disappointed!! ????"
3.0,Went there with friends the place is little crowded. Ordered all spicy items but none of them turned out to be spicy. Service was quick . Overall the food taste was satisfactory as per the fair price.  Note: Don't miss the Awesome sweet Lassi served in round Tumbler..!  Don't try this until unless you are fond of Rajasthani foods. Don't accept any Chinese items as its purely desi. I would suggest to look for other Veg restaurants in that area.
4.0,"Restricted to Veggies only , Different amount of North Indian dishes available .  Food :3.5 out of 5 Ambience :5 out of 5 Price : 4 out of 5"
4.0,i rate gramin a 4 bcoz it's a pretty cool veg restaurant & i like almost all their dishes .. the boondhi raita would be my favourite bcoz i can't seem to stop @ 1 :D .. the ambience is good & as well as the food
3.5,"Gramin s thali is a wonderful recharger for lunch. Roti,kaali daal,two veg items,one small portion of rice, a rolled papad and pickles will shake of the load of the first half and rejuvinate the second.  Go for it if your workplace is in koramangla."
5.0,awesome food. though we have to wait for sometime to get the table; its really worth it. Visited multiple times and was satisfied every single time
3.5,"A veggie place that serves a fixed menu . The place is small and cozy , service is prompt as expected . The place is pocket friendly as well . The taste on the other hand is just average . They could do a lot better with regard to naan breads as they are mostly dried , and the Dal makhani is always full of garam masala !Its good place if your a veggie on certain days to try for a change for indian food !"
4.0,"I visited thishotel on 6th Oct 2014, on my birthday for lunch with my wife. The hotel spaceis small hence felt little uncomfortable while having food.  We had Tawa Gobi, Naan,Panner Butter Masala, Jeera Rice and Buttermilk. The food is awesome and tasty.The dishes are prepared and served fresh and hot. The waiting time for the foodis also acceptable.  Nothing negativeto be mention, expect the space available for customers to sit. Hence, ratingthis restaurant as 4."
3.5,"Visited Gramin on Sunday for Lunch with family. The Experience was nice, but there were a few slip ups.   I called up at 2:30 and asked them for a table at 3:00. Was told that woudl accommodate me within 15 min of arriving. Reached at 3, and ordered the food while waiting to get the table.   Our order was Masala Papad, Gramin Koftha, Dal Makhani, Garlic Kulcha, Butter Naan, Tandoori Roti, Jeera Rice, Masala butter Milk, Jaljeera, Pudhina Khatta Meeta and Fresh lime soda.   Masala Papad - Nice and straight Forward. Gramin Koftha - Soft Dumplings but overspiced gravy, was too spicy. Dal Makhani - Very little cream, too much of tomato - Suggest do not order Garlic Kulcha- Nice Butter Garlic flavoured Kulchas Butter Naan- Decent Tandoori Roti- Excellent Jeera Rice - Decent, quality and flavor of rice not that great Masala butter Milk - Too Spicy, I know I order Masala one but this was double spicy. Jaljeera - Decent Pudhina Khatta Meeta - Decent Fresh lime soda. - Excellent  Overall food quality and freshness was great, but a few dishes looks like were not tasted before being sent out. Lack of QC seems to be the problem,"
4.5,"When you are tired of all the too oily food outside, just go here, It's totally a home food experience, Simple atmosphere, simple food and you can eat as much you want to satisfy your appetite."
5.0,"A typical rajasthani ambience with great old melodies played which syncs best with lip smacking delicious food they serve. Big que on weekends and holidays, so be prepared to wait."
4.0,"I've been to this place twice and the food has been commendable. The waiting time is customary here. One has to get used to it. We had to 10-15 mins for a table both the times. The place is small and cozy, but comfortable at the same time. A single space has been divided into the ground floor and the upper seating place.  I ordered the Veg Thali., it comes with 2 Rotis, 3 Sabzis, 1 Sweet, 1 Papad and a bowl of Jeera Rice. All the sabzis (Paneer Butter Masala, Aloo Bhindi and Dal Fry) were great the last time we visited the place. The Rotis just as expected. The Jeera Rice is limited in quantity, but the taste is very good. The whole package works out at 107 bucks per plate. They could increase the price a bit and make it an unlimited thali, that would work out well in their favor. The Lassi that we ordered was yummy. Good place for a good dining.  Always a throw of coin between this and OM whenever we are near Raheja Arcade. Om wins most of the time because of the unlimited thali. But this always serves as a substitute. No dedicated parking space. Better to park in Forum and walk towards the place. The service can be a bit better, its incredibly slow even though the order is just a thali."
1.5,"I have been to Gramin not once, but twice. The first time we were served bad food, I thought we had made the wrong choices. Few friends recommended this place. So I thought I should give it a second shot. And that's it... No more going to Gramin!!! The food was almost tasteless. Have tried rice as well as roti and curry. Did not like any of it."
4.0,"I have been here many times, apart from one or 2 instances, gramin never disappointed me. Food always very tasty. Special mention of starters - rajasthani bhindi, tawa corn peas.  Pure veg restaurant, so nice place to go out with ur pure veg parents."
4.0,"Simplicity is the ultimate form of Sophistication.. For me that was my Gramin experience.  Place utterly simple and yet cozy and comfy Food that is not very rich like many North Indian restaurants and not home cooked either. So it does make you feel like you have eaten a good meal out!  What I loved about this place 1.. It has a amazing list of options for Veg food. Things like Baingan Bharta. I rarely see that on the menus. 2.. Their ""Thanda"" drinks are just amazing. Simply amazing. We tried Lemon Soda, Jal Jeera, Pudhina. YYummm. 10/10  The food is to everyone's taste buds and will not disappoint. Just to emphasis the charm this little place has. We noticed a table of around 10 international tourists. So I wouldn't be surprised if this lists as one the must go authentic simple Indian food restaurant.  Our stomachs were full and we left with our pockets full too. For five of us the bill came upto Rs.1000!! Like where the hell does that happen anywhere..anymore!!  Finally.. I know lately North Indian has lost its charm..with all the new fancy cuisines giving it a tough competition. This is the place you go to..to renew your faith! :)"
1.0,I thnk even dis is more.. Coz the paneer subjeee is damm sweet!! Yuck... I advice u 2 Oly eat rice which r favourable...
4.5,"When it comes to great food with great taste in veg,I bet you can't beat this place.was there with my family and had an amazing experience.The taste was too good and the amazing 1970's Dev anand Songs playing in background just made the ambience more awesome. Freindly staff,and pocket friendly menu with amazing taste is the usp of this place.MUST TRY FOR VEGIES."
4.0,Ambience is okayish.. Food is good if u r looking for proper north indian.... Service is good.. On weekends dont forget to order while u r waiting coz it will take really long time otherwise...
3.0,Went for 2nd time.... Wanted to try something new... So went for a NORTH INDIAN THALI...  It was not at all expensive... Tasted nice.. Sabzi was great.   Just one thing.. After returning back we all friends (4 of us)  had headache... I don't really know the reason of it. But overall it was good.   The best thing: those low height chairs.. I loved them
3.5,"One of the best places for vegetarians in koramangala. The interiors resemble a simple and humble village. The food here is amazing. Service is a bit slow , especially on weekends. Rajma and panneer here are awesome. The gravies are tangy and rich. Rotis are soft and tender. Must have is butter naans and tikkas. Decent place , suited for 3 or 4 members , not more. Best time to visit weeknights as it is less crowded and you can eat in peace."
4.5,Its a hardcore vegetarian restaurant with nice ambiance. Sitting place is very nice.We were 11 people altogether and sitting arrangement was the most comfy.. They are quite popular so go with some extra time and decide your order before hand while waiting(u will have to wait if u r going on weekends) . The moment u will get seat ur order will be ready and no more waiting for the food again..Now comes the food ..Food was awsome..U can try anything and u will like it...try lachha paratha ..that was quite like what it exactly should be. service is little okay but u will manage with that.  Rest is fine and u will enjoy for sure...Happy Eating.
5.0,One of the best veg north indian food available in Blore. My parents loved the food when they had come down to Blore. a must visit place for all the veg north indian families... Keep up the good work . The staff is equally courteous and have pretty good info abt the menu...
4.0,Awesome food for veggies... A must vist restaurant
4.0,"It is rarely that I enjoy going to a vegetarian restaurant. But Gramin is one place I love going. (not very often though do I end up going) Since its weekends that I end up going, there is invariably a queue. But they have quick service which ensures you won't be kept waiting for a long time. They take the order while you are outside so that there is minimal time wasted. This is a double edged sword since you end up spending less time in the restaurant while you get your food quick!  The interiors are done alright with nothing fancy about the place. But you do get a feel of dining in North India. I haven't tried many of the dishes there, but whatever I have had there has been really yummy. Chatpata babycorn paneer left a lasting taste in my mouth and I make sure I order this every time I am here. Kadai veg is pretty awesome too. Bhindi Masala also is really nice (Bhindi is my favorite vegetable and hence Bhindi masala is a benchmark). The breads are all fluffy and good.  Great food at good prices is a mantra for success and this is what Gramin has done! A must visit for anyone and specially for the vegetarians!!"
4.5,easily the best veg in bangalore is cooked here. the only downside is the wait outside for a table to open up. the north indian food is to die for and I visit this joint whenever i am in proximity.
4.0,Starters are nice... Shikranji is the best here
3.0,"The food depends in the chef's mood. Small place, waiting for a table never surprises me each time I decide to go there."
4.0,A great place with quality Indian food with good taste and tidy ambience. The taste is really worth appreciation. Generally crowded. However u may not mind waiting a bit if u r getting great food...
4.0,One amazing place for home food where I can get mouth watering vegetarian north Indian meal. It's economic and the food's fresh. Perfect quantity and worth your time.
3.5,"Village food, village style. Small restaurant , big tastes and big money . This says it all . Worth a visit ."
4.5,"Visited for dinner on a Sunday evening.  Reservations (4/5) - I called at 730pm for a reservation for at 815 pm. I was told that they couldn't assure me a table but I could place my order while I waited and my order would be ready by the time I got a table. Fair enough. There were about 20 people waiting ahead of me but I still got a table in under 15 minutes.  Food (5/5) - The food is all vegetarian. I ordered a corn & peas starter and the gramin veg curry for the main course. Both the starter and the curry were very tasty. While ordering the curry I was a little apprehensive but then the person who took my order insisted that in case I didn't like the curry they would gladly replace it with any other curry of my choice. They said they want me to enjoy my meal and shouldn't have to eat something that I don't like. This was a really nice gesture! Brownie points!!!  Service (4/5) - The service was very prompt. We had ordered jal jeera. My mom wanted some sugar for her drink and I asked for some sugar. The waiter understood that we were asking for sugar for the jal jeera and gave us one bowl of sugar and one bowl of sugar syrup. Customer delight! Loved the attention to detail!!!  Ambience (2/5) Bollywood music playing in the background but can barely be heard over the din of people talking.  Overall, we had a really nice dinner and will definitely visit again."
2.0,V were looking for a gud n reasonable place to eat homely fud  when I came across this place..the high rating pepped my curiosity..so I thgt f giving it a try n wnt dre wit a frnd..to begin wit dy seriously need a bigger place..v had to wait fr 45 min to get inside..coming to the ambience..its alrgt..ntin to rave abt..v ordered veg seekh kabab. Kurmura paneer curry n naan....kebabs were okay..nt mouth watering..d paneer was a bit too spicy and people who have a taste fr very spicy fud may like it MRE Dan I did. Surprisingly d rotis n naans are quite costly.  Lastly I had masala shikanji which was gud.  Overall the place was avg nd didn't live upto the hype n expctatns..
4.5,"I worked near Gramin for 3years whilst living in India and this was, and still is, one of my favorite places for a seriously delicious meal and I often took visitors there too. I struggle to recommend a dish as anything you order will be amazing however their bread selection is a must for those looking to try out different Indian breads and make sure you order a lassi...amazing!! The restaurant is not fancy but is clean and simple, decorating in a village-like way with seating upstairs and down. Music plays and waiters will assist with explaining the menu. Dishes are served on beautifully authentic brass trays and cups, and everyone typically eats with their hand. Enjoy and try not to overheat!!                                                                 layoutlines.com"
4.0,"This is a small and cute lil Veg place. Thali is best I had. However, some people might find the quantity to be limited. But the food was really good. The best place to go when you are tired of shopping around koramangala and grab a bite ;)"
4.0,"Nice pocket friendly place and as my friend mentioned, when ur salary is over and still u wanna eat out then this is the best place. Do try once the proper gramin style. Lassi - try for sure :D"
4.0,"I had been here with my wife a fortnight ago. To start-with its a complete VEGETARIAN restaurant, which are a very few in the vicinity. Coming to the place, its a very well planned small place. Smart interiors to make it look like a village (Gramin). Service is at par with the price they charge for the food. Overall it gives you a Dhaba feeling, were nice North Indian Food is served with Old Hindi songs in background. A Full course Dinner with Soups, Starters, Subzi and Roti costed me 500 bucks. Definitely worth going back. Home Taste at very reasonable rates.  Uparse Gharse Najdik bhi hai :P"
3.5,"An order is taken while you are still waiting for your turn to be seated and you wait no more once you are placed.  The tables and chairs are not the same for all, you are lucky if you get to sit over the mattresses in corners around a table. Else, the chairs and tables placed in the center are too low for a tall / larger framed person to sit comfortably.  The ambiance does not reflect much of what the name suggests , however it goes decently well with a small family/friends get together over an authentic Indian ( Western) cusine.  The food is good, tastes as well as smells fresh, recepies distinctly flavoured and tasty. The variety offered is in no compromise with the quality , however many items tend to be spicy. The service, just good."
4.0,"One of the best pure veg North Indian restaurants in koramangala. Be ready to wait because it is very popular. Its cost effective, fast, decent ambience and great tasting food."
1.0,"Had visited this place 2 years back nd remenber having a good time. However when we went back this last month we were in for a rude rude shock...the ambience has become shoddy, the service at best average and the food was an absolute and total let down. Oh and the place is def over priced considering the barely there servings that it provides for its barely edible food."
4.5,Traditional Veg preparation with a Desi flavour. U will definitely like it as its very much authentic. A must go place!
4.0,"This place was eludive for over a decade for one simple reason.. you always found loads of people waiting in the queue outside this small restaurant at any time of the day, throughout the year. Gramin has been a place often sweared by Rajasthani/Gujaratis esp. Jains Happen to visit them today and as usual one still found people waiting outside with waiters asking for orders while in queue to reduce waiting time once seated. Luckily for me, a table for 2 was available and we marched (Yes, the hussle bustle and pace would make one feel that u might be asked to swallow food as u walk) inside and found a small corner. Ambience was nothing but plain decor and few picture frames, tables were stacked quite close and relatively quite small,  hardly some place to walk between tables and the ceiling was just few inches higher than me owing to 2 floors created in a small place. It was getting quite claustrophobic with so many people and loud conversations of groups seated around you when all of a sudden u see an army of waiters appearing one after another asking if the order was placed outside and if not please do so. We quickly order a starter and main course for these army to retreat and try to soak in the environment by when the food arrives.. Oh yeah! Service was quick and serving was equally fast. We missed knife and fork while eating our starters but were promplty given when asked.  Coming to food, we ordered Malai Paneer Tikka in starters and Kurmura Paneer gravy along with few rotis. Starter was decent, nothing to die for, paneer was a tad hard and flavours were blend for our taste. Kurmura Paneer gravy was worth dying for with succulent paneer and medium spicy gravy made of some grated vegetables. Rotis were typically north indian, quite big and just perfectly  cooked. We had to keep asking for water refills but apart from that we had our own space and peace while we gorged on food. A meal for 2 consisting of a starter, main course and 4 rotis lightened our wallet by 350 bucks which popped my eyes out. Bottom line: if you don't mind waiting in queue and claustrophobic interiors,  this is the place to be to indulge in gastronomical pleasure which is also value for money."
3.5,"The name matches to its theme.This is a good place to treat friends.food tastes good, yet light on the pocket.I recommend sitting on the 1st floor.glasses are dirty."
4.0,"As been a Marwadi I love the food here. Its just reminds me of typical north. The food is gud thali is must try. I love the personally the aam pana,,butter naan ,paneer (mny on list)."
3.0,The wait of 45 min for this over crowded place is not worth a penny. First the place is too small. Then they dont have proper fan or any other source for cool air. It tends to get very sweaty and hot with time. Then we ordered soups. It was too less in quantity and no salt or taste. Spicy items were too spicy and sweet added items like malai methi paneer was too sweety. It was like eating kova. Only good was masala papad. I woukd not visit this place again.
3.5,"I haven't been here for quite a while The first time I went there, the food was exceptional but the second time it was just good. The place is for vegeterians, if you are going there, try the thali, the better one among the rest."
5.0,"This is one of the very few places in Bangalore where they just got it right, when it comes to North India food. It is just below my office and one stop for my kind of lunch, a super friendly one. You gotta try the thali here and garlic kulcha, kadai paneer and veg biryani are unique and excellent. Don't think twice if you are new in Koramangala and live and die by roti and paneer."
4.0,"A decent place. Food tastes so good, especially the navaratna korma-A must taste one. If ua planning for lunch be there 30 min before n register uaself. Gets bit crowded. Only issue is with the music, not audible n no pleasant musiq, which they have to really concentrate on."
3.5,"A great place when you're hit by hunger pangs and you can eat a horse. Great veg food, a bit awkwardly crowded seating. Tends to get very crowded on weekends, and you may have to wait for up to 45 mins to get in. But the food is good, I wouldn't say very great and the service is good."
1.0,Worst experience of dinning out got plastic piece in dal rude behaviour of management when intimated about the same.
4.5,"Food is always a big deal for me , I think I can go over the top in a search of good food . And above all when I see Restaurant having typical North Indian food in Bangalore , a thought comes into my mind , I should give it a try ; but this time the try comes out with flying colors as the food here is awesome with its tastes . Firstly , Someone has to wait to get a seat over in the restaurant as they are managing with in a space where there is no room to swing a cat but they have excellent ambiance that will replicate the authentic North Indian dining . And the good thing is , you will get delivered the food with in a span of 5 minutes when you seat at your table . Secondly , the best part about there food is their variety . I mean starting from Rajastani thali you can indulge in eating veg sik kebab and end your meal with a lassi or sikhanji . We ordered Gramin Biriyani which was a biriyani made of mint mixed rice , though the quantity was less , it tasted up to the mark . The paneer handi masala was very good and the aloo paratha was awesome . someday along I would love to visit GRAMIN again !!!!!!"
4.5,The food is really good..especially Chatkela gobi and paneer.. Worth the price that you pay for.. Ambience is really good with old hindi songs..
3.5,Good veg food. Has been a popular joint for many years now in koramangala.
5.0,"The very worth full pointer for its food quality and yet maintaining the food quality... Hw these ppl strike the rightest cord in food and serve some very basic yet best dishes is so amazing. Food was really soul satisfying. We had a paneer preps, dal tadka, rotis and a pulav. Paneer prep was very fresh, no added pres or colour or extra masala. Just right..  daal and Pulav was also gud. And the best part were gulabjamus, so tender and melt in mouth. Loved them U r doing a great job guys.. Keep it up. A recommended place."
4.0,"I have visited this place a number of times and the last was a little while ago..One of the best places in town for North Indian Vegetarian food.. Never have I entered this place on a weekend evening without waiting in a long queue.  Situated in Raheja Arcade, down the Forum road in Koramangala, this place has an artistic uncultured village theme with tables and chairs matching the theme. They have the short stools which look great.  Coming to the food, almost everything tastes delicious. I think I have tried half their menu till now and there's nothing in particular I remember which I can share here to avoid. Thali is one of their major crowd pullers on weekdays. Even tough the place has limited seating capacity, the service is just awesome. You can place the order before hand and as soon as you get a table, your order is almost ready. The service is fast and good.Worthy pricing for the kind of food they offer. Anytime recommended!"
3.5,Good place to eat in a budget approx 650 for two people .. It is bit conusted.. But one can bear with it .. The dal makhani and paneer bhurji are worth. Thandai and kesar lassi are worth a try. We mainly ordered lachcha parantha and butter naan. We found butter naan better than it. The staff is again friendly and the service they offer is commendable.
4.0,Very tasty food - you can ask for extra spicy and they prepare it the right way. Waiting time is not too long either. Great customer service.
3.5,"Even though I am a hard core non vegetarian, this place is a must visit to satiate your home (North Indian) food craving! The food is good, its rich and good portions as well. It is an affordable place and the setting is very rustic, very rural and traditional. A good experience!"
3.5,Very authentic. Ambience is something I like cause it makes you feel ur at home. Authentic food as well rotis and thadkaz.
4.5,First restaurant i  have been to in bengaluru. I tried Indian dishes and their preparation was awesome. The interior will make you feel that you are in Rajasthan. The service is also good. This restaurant is very famous so almost anytime you go you might have to wait for a while to get your seat. But while you wait they start preparing your dishes that you ordered so your time will not be wasted.
4.5,"I can't quite explain how wonderfully surprised I was to have such beautiful (literally) north Indian vegetarian food. I had their butter naan (always a favourite of mine, wherever I go) which was succulent and toasted to perfection. The bindhi masala was just unbelievably good. I wanted more of it. In addition to that, we also ate palak Paneer (I liked it, although my friends weren't too accepting of how bland it seemed to them) and some aloo dish that I can't recall.  Their choice is amazing, and it's best to go there with an empty stomach.  Service was also wonderful, but I enjoyed most how we had to sit at low tables with our feet up, almost. Traditional, to say the least.  Go early enough, or you'll never get a table."
3.5,Good north Indian food with lots of spices and love...feel like home...dont miss home food just go to GRAMIN
4.5,"Gramin is a perfect place for veggie lovers and also quite light on pocket. We ordered aam panna for drinks (very nice and refreshing), paneer starter, mix veg, alu dam, pineapple raita and stuffed kulchas. All the dishes mentioned here were really good. Kulchas particularly was stuffed nicely. The service was quick. The ambience is simple and the place has limited seating capacity. Location is bang on. Must visit if you are looking for good veg food with not so fancy ambience."
4.5,"The queue was so long, I went to Om instead. I guess that's the story of almost all people who go to Grameen but lack the perseverance to wait in the endless line. And boy, the first time I went to this place, the people waiting on the two rows of chairs facing each other separated by an invisible wall of contempt gave me the impression that some event was going on in the complex. Nah. Good old Grameen. Make a reservation well in advance. The food is good, the ambience is alright. Is the wait worth it all? Not really. Go to Om."
1.0,"Owner doesn't even understand and know Customer Service and very rude. Lots of rats and cockroaches move around. It looks curtains and cushion covers not washed for ages. Served food is very very cold. Qty is less, not enough for 1 person. Servers doesn't know the time sense. Overall pathetic place."
3.5,"I had a short visit to Bangalore so after finishing my work I met up with my college friends.We were around 8 people and mostly veg so decided to head here after visiting the forum mall.The ambiance is good , it gives you a feeling of dhabha. Coming to the food we ordered: bhindi rajasthaniveg sheek kebabstuffed tandoori aloomalai paneer tikkamix raitanimbi ki shikanjigarlic kulchastuffed kulchabutter nangobi masaladal frymalai koftajeera riceAll the above items were decent to taste , quantity was pretty low , service was decent considering the crowd. Price wise its average. Overall a decent place to hangout if you are a vegetarian or in a mood to have veg."
3.0,"Never preferred experimenting with veg restaurants but i have many gujju and marwari friends and they took me to Gramin. Nothing extra-ordinary to be honest. We had the banjara paneer tikka, butter naan and kadai paneer. it is not sapcious enough to accommodate a horde of people. Decent food quality and ohkay prices. Overall rating is average."
3.5,"My friends and I made an unplanned, quick dinner visit to Gramin. I had visited this place a few times before and had a very faint memory of it being good, hence I had intimated that we dine in Gramin and the hint was carried.  The foremost matter that you'll note about this situation is that it is very limited in terms of space! So if you're planning on visiting this place on a weekend with more than 5-6 friends, make a reservation. The restaurant is situated in the Raheja arcade building, Koramangala.  It's a Pure vegetarian and is has a very unsophisticated, rural India theme at its center. This can be clearly witnessed in the mud plaster on the walls, copper tumblers and vessels in which the food is done and the table designs.  Coming to the food, we ordered the Veg Sheekh Kabab and Stuffed Tandoori Aloo to get our stomachs started. The restaurant was full but the service was quick and we go the food in less than 5-10 minutes. The Veg Sheekh Kabab was a bit try to my liking and the I felt the Tandoori aloo was a better tasting dish that the kabab. To quench our thirst, we ordered jal jeeras and it came to us in these big mugs. We ordered the Gramin Veg subzi and Aloo Jeera to go with Garlic Kulchas. With more customers pouring in, we felt that the service was getting a bit dull, but then the food got in, but just before we grew impatient. The Garlic Kulchas were smelling really good with the garlic aroma filling my senses. The Aloo jeera is not the best I've had but the gramin veg subzi was better of the two. I wouldn't suggest anyone to order these two dishes here as they don't do justice to the place and I have tasted other subzis before which were better.  Overall Experience  AMBIENCE : 6.5/10  FOOD : 7/10  SERVICE : 8/10"
2.0,"There was a time when it was THE restaurant for veggies. Bring a pure vegetarian I used to visit this place very often. The aam panna, the fried bhindi, the kababs were my favorite. But off late the quality and taste is deteriorating. I visited with friends in May 2013 after a long time and found the food to be just average. A couple of my friends even fell sick after eating here. It was either too spicy or just bland. However I thought I had caught them on an off day and went again with parents in Sep 2013. This time not only was the good bad but the service was pathetic too. When we told the waiter that our gobhi was not done properly he just shrugged and walked away. The food was so bad that we ended up walking out and visiting a nearby ""darshini"" to fill our stomach :-(. Sad to see one of my favorite restaurants going downhill."
3.0,"I think Gramin is one of those vegetarian places where you get good, wholesome food at very reasonable rates. I still remember when I had first arrived in Bangalore in the spring of 2008, a friend of mine took me to this place. Nothing fancy - just good food. The thali is the main item that draws in the crowds. Two-three curries, a sweet, two hot piping naans, a bowl of rice and your day is made. Try the aloo parathas: good size and what I like about them are they are not dripping with oil. The Hara Bhara Kebabs are just okay. The achaari paneer is divine but i found it slightly overcooked and the mix of spices used in this dish put me off. The lassi is excellent and I have it everytime I go there. The place has two floors and the decor is nicely done. Gives u a rustic feel with the copper plates. The waiters are helpful and the food is always piping hot. Nothing extraordinary but worth a try."
2.5,"Gramin had kept my expectations high for good vegetarian food with good ambiance for a very long time. The expectations fall down pretty bad!  If you go by the servings/services which they have in their price range, you'll feel everything alright but at the end of the day its the food quality and taste which matters.  Ambiance is pretty good! Everything gives the feeling of it's name. Even the serving style so, using copper glasses and other utensils.  When you come to food, it's where the actual difference comes. I am not sure if they have this standard taste or it was a bad day but most of the things I ate seemed a bit burnt whether you talk about Bhindi Rajasthani, Chatka Gobi & Paneer and Lasooni Paneer Dhuandar in starters or Veg Akbari, Dum Aloo and even Gramin Paneer in main course which is their speciality. Even one time the naans which we order started coming burnt, so we had to return it back.  I hope I was having a bad day with the restaurant. If not, there is a lot of improvement required. On other aspects like services, ambiance and even cost-effectiveness, the restaurant is holding quite well.  Good Luck!"
3.5,"Gramin as the name says village type interior and utensils also. Pure veg and pure jain food:). Preparation is perfect just a bit spicy so while ordering just mention medium spicy. We ordered starter baby-corn, peas and paneer served wid green chutney that was awum..  :) Then drinks that is grmins's usp we tried nimbu shikanji and pudhina pana both are fab and refreshing...must tried type. In main course we went for tandoori roti and gramin kofta perfect for wrap up.  So overall very gud experience wid superb food.:)"
3.5,Lived it when we first went here .especially their chilli soda. Next time we tried lassi which was ok ok. Other food items are also fine Cost -3/5 Ambiance -3/5 nice looks but conjusted n mosquitos Que a few was there Food -3.5/5 Cleanliness 3.5/5
3.0,"One of decent places for vegetarian food . Ambience is rustic and gives a native feel . Regarding food , sometime its too good and other time its ordinary . Something that i figured out to be consistent here is tawa paneer and shikanji. Most of time gravy of different vegetable taste same and is really disappointing.  Try to avoid ""dal makhani"" here. Thali can be delight most of time during lunch.Service is ok and staff are co operative  . Most importantly its pretty much within pocket."
4.0,"simplicity, great food, taste gives this place a must visit for all the vegetarians. a little crowded over the weekends, but a good place to wait up and have a good family/friends lunch/dinner. The price is pretty reasonable considering some real good places surrounding this place.  The lassi is a must try at this place.  The place is rustic, good place to eat, talk around and have a good time. a little heads up, if going on the weekends better go at least an hour early and with a little snack in order to wait for about an hour or so, as you have to wait for the yummy food to hit your stomach walls.  A great experience. Cheers..!!"
4.0,excellent veg food the bhendi fry is amazing but the need to expand the place for the no of people who visit here.
4.0,"Almost all of us have this romanticised notion of a Dhaba - rustic, earthy, no-frills & most importantly, serving lip-smacking food. Now imagine a dhaba in the midst of a bustling city, but not in its earthy entirety, rather one which wants to be modern yet retain its connections to the countryside. What you get as a result is a place like Gramin . Interestingly decorated, with bright colours and an intentionally created rustic ambience which gets ""heightened"" by, of all the things,  the lack of air conditioning !!!   Gramin is small and crowded on most occasions, especially during lunch hours on weekdays. You would have to invariably wait for a table. But the food is worth the wait and you need no further evidence of that than by the fact that so many hard-core non-vegetarians patiently wait in line at this pure-veg restaurant !!!  Unless it's some team lunch or celebration, lunch is usually a quick one in which case Thalis are the preferred choice. Thalis are fairly sized with a Bowl of Rice, 2 Rotis, 3 Curries & Sabzis, a papad & of course, Raita, followed by a Sweet and more often than not, this would be a filling meal. Everything is served fresh and hot and taste-wise, they rate pretty high.   At other times, we'd usually opt for Roti Baskets along with individual curries. Pretty much every curry that we've ordered till date has not disappointed us, including the Dals, which sadly are neglected at most places. They also have a pretty good but small collection of beverages such as Jaljeera, Shikanji, Chaas, Lassi etc- the Kesar Lassi & Anjeer Milk Shake are my favourites.  Verdict :- Gramin is a place that will not disappoint you either for the food or for the VFM, which is very high !! The long wait might be the only disappointing factor."
4.5,Awesome food. Reasonable price. Difficult to get space on weekend.
3.5,"I Have been to Gramin many times, Great taste and  Its a budgeted place."
4.5,I love this place for its sheer simplicity. The earthy rustic feel this place has is available in very few places. The food is equally good. Made in the simplest of the ways and n served in it grandeur. There is no reason why somebody should not love this place.
1.5,"Gramin is one of those legendary Bangalore restaurants, having started the all  veg north Indian menu phenomenon, which is going really strong now. Since it had been a couple of years since I was last here, we walked in with some excitement.  Ambience  Being a weekday lunch, the place was filled with chattering office groups. To those who havent been here, this is a brightly lit but cozy outfit; the dcor exuding the flavor of Rajasthan. Though not very big, it somehow accommodates large groups (max 6  8).  Service  Mostly fuss  free. Maybe because it was peak lunch hour, they seemed to be in a hurry to be done with us.   Food  We ordered crispy baby corn, Gramin kofta (greedy as we were) and phirki parathas. The starter was nothing memorable, but was alright. The main course however, was a disaster. The rotis had way too much chilli powder rubbed into them (and I have a fairly spicy palette). The kofta was bland, dry, chewy and random. We struggled to finish even one piece. There was some relief to be had with a standard boondi raita which did its job somewhat. But then how hard is it to get curd right. The only satisfying item at the table was the pudina khatta meetha cooler. That wasnt much food but I was left with a bloated stomach and an uneasy feeling the rest of the day. This is not good food.   Price  To me, Rs.700 for a disaster subzi, rotis and drinks is overpriced.   Verdict  I will not be returning here, I am done with Gramin."
4.0,"Well I am a non-vegetarian , but I loved the food they serve. I used to take lunch almost 3 times in a week when I was working in Koramangala. This place is awesome. very smartly planned hotel for optimum siting place. Ambiance is like a village. Thali is a must to try. My personal opinion I believe they should look into the cleanness and a bit fast service, some time they take long time to serve food, but once they serve you will not look into else where ... :P   I would recommend this place -- a heaven for  vegetarians"
4.5,"A must visit for North Indian pure vegetarian taste food. Excellent service, proper co-ordination between staff members and nice ambiance."
3.5,Hog on food and don't really worry about the bill. Nice and small place thali as well as a-la-carte both are good. Can't do away with lassi I love it. And food taste yes north Indian taste. With so many big places around they still manage to have waiting queue with the service and food.
4.0,"What stands out about the place at first sight is its interior designing. Really well decorated and the colours stand out. But the place seems to be cramped for space, low ceiling, not  and seems congested especially during weekends when it gets crowded(Makes you suffocate). This kind off brings the ambience down if you are looking to sit back relaxed and enjoy your meal peacefully . But when it comes to food, it is really awesome. You get authentic north- indian rajasthani food. A very exhaustive vegetarian menu in fact. The gravies taste really unique, not somethin you have tasted elsewhere. The quality of food is really consistent and really commendable. It was definitely a very wholesome experience. The Shikanji they serve is a MUST-HAVE.  Price point of view its definitely a little expensive. But i'm sure you would not leave unsatisfied with the food.  And the place is crowded especially on weekends, you need to wait atleast for 20 mins on average. But they tend to take your order when you are waiting. If you are around koramangala and looking for a good place to have quality north indian vegetarian food, i would recommend you this place 9 out of 10 times."
3.5,"As they if you like to eat ""ghar ka khana"" and you're in the area, you should give a try to this place. I have been here numerous no. of times and never disappointed.  If you go to this place, go just with expectation of a good food as there are no AC and even roof is very low, you have to watch your head while moving inside Gramin. That's it! There is nothing bad about this place.  It can be very crowded on the weekends and you will have to wait for 30-40 mins to get a table but the management will take your orders while you're waiting outside so that you don't have to wait longer for food.  One of the good things about this place is they prefer your choice. You want spicy you get it, you want very spicy you get it, you want no spicy you get that too.  Gramin Kofta, Veg Handi, bhindi anardana are one of the very good vegetables i have eaten there. Season Aam Panna is just to good, even the masala buttermilk is very too nice(you will literally get a feeling of buttermilk not curd).  Service is very good and prompt and this place is very very cheap. You will not get such a tasty food at such a low price anywhere in bangalore.  Overall, its a great place, you should surely give a try."
2.0,Went there with my friends few weeks back. It was my first time here. Firstly they made us wait for a very long time so I was hoping may be it's because this place is so popular. But when we finally landed inside I realised the place is too small to fit in a large crowd. I wasn't too happy with the food either overly spicy. Only thing I liked was the lassi. I don't think I ll make another visit here.
4.0,"Gramin lived upto its name in simplicity of food and simplicity of ambience.  The food had the ""Maa ka khana"" touch and was wholesome without being oily and rich. The pleasantries didn't end there and the best was saved for last in terms of the bill. I can't remember the last time I paid such precious little and that for an extremely fulfilling meal. Go Gramin. Bon appetit."
2.5,Food here is average and service is not so good.
4.0,My all time favourite place. Everything is decent there. Always see a rush. This is a iconic place in bangalore. Whenever we go to Forum Mall this is a must have lunch / dinner place.
3.5,It still has same quality evrytime you go. Shikhanji & buttermilk is something worth a try. They need to improve on main course dish quality as well as serving.
4.0,"Went here with couple of friends. Good menu, some dish are lil on higher spice ( andhra type food lover will love it). Decent ambience and good staff behavior .  Menu are pretty good with lots of variety. Delivery time of food is 15 mint. Go for kaju dishes and jaljeera is good here."
3.5,"Have been to Gramin many a times. Used to go thr daily for lunch and mostly people used to stick to their Thali (~3 years back it was Rs 60 and amazingly good!). Today visited the place again after a long time, that too on a Sunday, not a wise decision. Ended up waiting for almost 40 minutes but completely worth the wait!  Gramin staff members are professional, they take orders while people are waiting, and usually deliver quick food, once you are get a seat. Their Shikanji, aam panna (probably the best), buttermilk (personally i like the non-spicy one), are pretty good. Best thing is thr Dal Fry, Koftas (Malai n Gramin, both are good!), kadhai veg n even babycorn capsicum, which goes well with Pudina Parantha or Methi Parantha. Dal makhani is average comparatively.  In starter, thr paneer tikka platter is average, though the chatpata paneer babycorn is pretty good.   The only bad experience we had with the sabji was navratan korma, which was pretty bad. In starter, we did not liked was tomato soup, which was pale orange colored n was not tasting of tomato.  Finally, its a very budgeted place, not even AC, but the price is very justified. The interiors are cozy, though the ceiling is very low and watch for your head!  All in all, a great place, for good North-Indian (Rajasthani style) food!"
4.0,nice place as in better go with a reservation before hand :) looks all cozy form the outside but try not exceeding a max of 10 people in a group cause it ll get uncomfortable to eat . Prices a litlle on the higher fringe but no issues as quality is maintained :) chaaas and jaljeera are really refreshring and are a must try :)
3.5,One of the many over hyped places in blr. Go-visit-eat. Don't expect too much. I liked ambience and matching choice of cutlery but that's not what fills belly. I will say over chilly to my taste. Good but definitely over hyped.
2.0,It's just too average of a place. It's not good at all compared to the menu and the price and there no ambience. I fail to understand why the rating is so high... It's definitely not worth it. The price and the food is not proportional. The hospitality when I visited was not good. The location is not good at all. So thats my rating is low for this one.
3.0,"Had visited on a weekday, food quality is good but service is slow. Ambience is decent.."
3.5,One of the finest pure veg restaurants. Been to this place thrice and never been disaapointed except the fact that there is a huge waiting. Ambience is good and food is great. A goid place to visit if you have a light pocket.
4.0,"Located in the Raheja Arcade shopping complex opposite Forum in Koramangala, Garmin is a very reasonably priced restaurant serving vegetarian North-India food. The ambiance is simple and the place is not very spacious but they serve mouth-watering food. However, on a hot sunny over crowded day, the place does get a bit suffocating. Thalis are available during lunch. If going for A la Carte, following dishes are recommended:  1. Aloo Chatpata 2. Tawa Paneer 3. Hara Bara Kabab 4. Stuffed Tandoori Aloo 5. Paneer Butter Masala 6. Veg Kohlapuri 7. Dal Makhani  Masala Papad and Shikanji are a must try here. The service is amazing.  Food 4/5 Service 4./5"
4.0,"Must visit for vegetarian North-India food. Simple ambiance and not very spacious but great taste. Waiting is inevitable on weekends. Very difficult to say that a specific dish is bad. Unarguably the best North-Indian veg restaurant in koramangala.  Ambience- 3.5 VFM- 4.0 Food- 4.0 Service- 3.5   Will I visit again? Yes, i visit frequently."
3.5,Have been there regularly many years ago. Awesome place for homely Veg food.  Certainly try Masala Buttermilk - Best in Town.
2.0,"We went to this place after reading very good reviews here. But the first thing I noticed was, the place is very small and congested. We did not even like the food and the service was very slow. There are no ACs for a hot day as well.   The prices are definitely cheap and very affordable but the taste was certainly not up to the mark."
4.5,Really good restaurant...
4.0,"The thing that I liked the most about this is the quantity served. The ambience was simple, pretty and neat. They serve water is copper glasses, which was interesting. For starters, I had masala papad and Chatpata babycorn paneer. Masala papad was a little too salty. But paneer babycorn was good, and and the amount served was almost like main course. For main course I had Methi malai mutter, Paneer keema pulao . They tasted amazing, esp methi malai mutter! The rotis there were surprisingly too costly.  Overall, the food tasted good, service was pretty quick, and the place is worth visiting more than once."
3.5,"Long queue with impatient waiting time. And why not? Awesome veg food. Small place but serves mouth watering smacking food. My all time favorite - roti basket, malai kofta and aloo chatpata. Among thanda - personal best is nimbu shikanji. I am a hard core non-vegetarian but this place makes me go mad for veg food too. Value for money and highly recommended."
4.5,"Brilliant place and very high value for money. Was disappointed at first that it was a veg restaurant, but it swept me off once I tasted the Dal Makhni. We were a gumble of 10 people, and the bill hardly came to 150 per person. The place is pretty crowded and it is difficult to get a table. The service pretty quick and the waiters cordial. Sigh! Would have visited more often had I been a vegetarian."
4.5,"After going to this I come to know that I had missed, lot of veg mouth watering dishes. Even it beats all my non veg dishes . Simply super ambiance,taste everything.  environment was simply suits the name of restro. Paneer and babycorn starters are awesome and simply fantastic.  I can confidently recommend to all non vegies too.  Here comes the rating : Ambiance : 4.5/ 5 Serving : 4/5 Food : 4.5/5 VFM: 4.5/5   Total : 4.375 (I will go with 4.5)"
5.0,"A hot day.. You are looking for a quick lunch,  tummy grumbling, yet you are still worried about your diet plan, somewhere close by, no long waits, simple yet sumptuous food.. All this confusion! Look no further, the answer to all of it GRAMIN!!  Located in the Raheja Arcade shopping complex in Koramangala, tucked into a shop as big as a mobile showroom these days, you'll find yourselves looking at a pillar decorated with all the accolades received by this restaurant.  Whenever I want to have a light yet sumptuous and a pocket friendly lunch, my go-to place is Gramin. Beautifully decorated interiors with so much detail given to ensure you truly have a North Indian Gramin (Village) like experience. The menu is simple yet I'd recommend you to have the absolutely wonderful Thali. The thaali at offer has 3 subzis, 2 rotis, papad, raitha, 1 cup of rice special of the day and 1 cup of Gulaab Jamoon for the sweet toothed. I know what you must be thinking - ""I thought you said light lunch"". Trust me on this, but even after eating this much, you feel light and good. The taste everytime is spot on! Top the meal off with a Lime Soda or a Lassi and you just enjoyed a true Gramin experience.  Service is quick, everything served hot to the plate. No complaints about the taste or consistency. And the cost is so less that there's nothing left to fret about!  This has been my lunch option, once in almost every alternate week for the last 4 years. Loved it, Love it and will keep Loving it!!  Ambience - 4.5/5 Taste - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Cost - 5/5"
4.0,Good Spread of food. Must give credit to the owner for utilizing space efficiently and designing a nice ambience. Food tastes good and is a delight !!
4.0,"Place is good and service is quick. For me is near by where I have to walk 2 minutes. Food menu is full of mouth watering options and it taste good as well. The only thing I don't like about this place is you have to wait for a while to get place. Its good to see crowd as most of the people like Gramin and trust the food quality too. But its annoying if you come at lunch hour everyday and see the same routine.   But overall, its good place to have lunch and enjoy the retro music as same. I will recommend this place to all my friends but not the timings :D"
4.5,The service is the best in town. You need to place the order before you get table because this hotel is crowded most of the time because of it's authentic North Indian flavour of food. It's worth waiting. They serve the best thali as far as I know and you we will never regret eating any dish and drink any appetiser. Lassi is the best and Roti and Panner butter masala was epic.
4.0,"Love this place...awesome food...phirki paratha and mirch ka salan are my favourites here...whoever I take to this place, I always order these for sure and not a single person didn't like it..and the best part is it isn't expensive at all, very light on your pockets...value for money...recently, they have renovated the place a little..looks good. doesn't have AC and is very small but there are always people waiting to savour the food here..must visit :)"
1.0,"I kinda so liked this place until my last visit. I have been to this place like 10 times but after my last experience I will not able to step into this restaurant anymore.  On my last visit I ordered one Rajasthani Bhindi, one Panner Tikka Masala and one Butter Naan.  The food was not even warn, forget about steaming hot. The Naan was like a a rubber tube.  This is not it.. As i was eating this non-sense food (no option as it was late) i found one hair in Panner Tikka Masala. I asked that manager to change it and he did it, but later I found one more hair in the Naan... When I complied to the manager, he said sorry but told that he cant do anything as the cook is the one who makes it. (I was shocked by such a response)  I left the place there itself  Gramin was like one of the best North - Indian restaurants in Koramangala but not.. I am Sorry.. cant visit again...  Rating:  Food: 1/5 Hygiene: 0/5 Ambiance: 2.5/5"
4.5,pure vegiee.... tasty food... value for money. only thing is waoting time on weekends. otherwise scores good on evry aspect.
4.0,"Well, I am a non-vegetarian, yet I have been to this place 4 times in last 3 weeks (since the time i landed in Bangalore..:P) I like the place. The preparations are just too good. Quantity, quality and ambience wise it gives a comfort...both in stomach and pocket..:) Thalis are available at lunchtime, that are real value for money and worth a try... I love their starters and my fav main course is veg chatpata..:)"
3.5,The food was good and was easy on the pocket.. the ambience was decent and the service was nice. Dining here was a good experience overall.
3.0,"Ambience - one of a kind unique ambience, I liked it a lot. Food- it wasn't amazing nor was it bad. It was fine.  Service and hospitality- very good, well behaved and we'll conducted waiters. Value for money- good value for money. Would I recommend this place to my friends- yes. Would I visit again- definitely :)"
4.5,"I had been to this place on April 14th for my b'day with my 12 friends.. We had booked the table already on phone. We reached the place by 2 15. The waiter greeted us & gave a good place to sit. He was insisting us to order fast & it will get closed by 3. Their behaviour I didn't like, but in so much hurry we ordered & had food. Food was yummy & kesar lassi was yummy.. But staff was not friendly to us. I liked the food.. :)"
2.5,"Pros-  - Good, simple food. -Good Lassis -Light on pocket  Cons-   -The staff is not at all polite and extremely bossy.They just want you to eat and leave as soon as possible.   -Don't rely on the waiting time they tell you, we were told a waiting time for 30 mins, but this went upto 1 hour.  -On weekends they expect you place orders outside the restaurant itself. So, if you are looking for a nice relaxing dinner, then this is not the place to be."
4.0,Nice village ambiance but the prices are a bit on the higher side . The thaali is the most affordable and totally worthy for 100 bucks .
4.0,"A regular haunt for many and subjected to too many reviews for me to actually make a difference by writing one. Nonetheless, here goes nothing.  We've been to Gramin multiple times, so many times that we've lost count now. We always start our meal with the zesty Masala Papad and the evergreen glass of Lassi and Chaas. Lassi for me, to satiate the sweet tooth, and Masala Chaas for my better half, the fiery one.  We always make it a point to try new things everytime and the food doesn't disappoint. The own downside being that if you arrive anytime after 7:30 PM, expect to wait a long long while before you get seated. However, the staff takes your orders while you're waiting for a table hence making the wait at the table a little lesser.   Tip: Do carry a kerchief or a napkin with you. The food is chillicious and almost always makes your nose run. Copious aounts of Rasmalai or gulabjamun after the meal help!  Bon Appetit."
3.0,"Have been here a couple of times. Congested setup but the food makes you ignore it. The waiting queue for this restaurant can make you amazed for the first time. Trust me, people are ready to wait upto one hour for a table here!!  Food here is bound to tickle your taste buds. Gives really tough competition to it's adjacent restaurant,  Om :-)"
3.5,"A unique named restaurant within the urban Bangalore.  Straight away it attracts people to come in and check out the offerings in the restaurant. I surely have been there quite a few times and liked it.  Its a compact veg restaurant where you do get good value for money.  When you initially enter the Raheja Arcade the really big mall, you will see loads of people standing in front of the restaurant.  When you go inside you find that its the waiting queue for the restaurant and for sure it has a wait period of nearly 20-30 mts many of the times just coz its popular restaurant and the food is food.  If you are hungry, it might be good to start off with the soup in the offering, which I think are very few like Tomato & Corn. Starters, Tawa Paneer, Tawa Gobi, Crispy Babycorn  are really good to try out. The main course also has plenty of veg-subji options and among my favourites in this restaurant includes - Veg Kolhapuri, Gramin Kofta, Paneer Mutter Masala.  You should try the subjis with some stuffed Kulcha and Laccha Paranthas.  Its only about the food there, the Tanda Tanda options there.  There is this Anjeer Milk-shake, Gulkand Milkshake, Rose or Kesar Lassi.  These are the best of the lost. Briyani options, try out the Gramin Biryani which is really good.  Restaurant sure has something about its taste which I guess attracts people.  Always try to get a booking or appointment before going there lest you might need to wait.  My overall rating is around 3.5. Food - 3.5/5 Ambience - 3.25/5 Service - 3.5/5                                             fodyssey.com"
3.5,"This place has rustic village look as name suggests (gramin), food is quite good but deteoriated over past few years... when it started food taste, quality and quantity was awesome... all 3 parameters deteoriated over time... its drinks and starters are great.. main course is good too... you won't go wrong for majority of dishes on menu, so try anything you wish to....  but Don't ever go on weekends, its mad rush... you can't have food with peace... their low celing makes you feel like you are in jail and ceiling may hit you anytime... and if it gets crowded too (which happens 90% of the time) you feel suffocated.... you will get a feeling that complete food quickly and go out to have some breathe...  Very good place for veggies and must try but on weekdays :)"
3.5,"Gramin is one of the decent options to take your vegetarian guests out for lunch/ dinner. They have a great veg menu. I specially loved their Crispy friend bhindi that they used to make(not sure they do now, it's been ages that we have been there). The only that that we used to hate was the long wait time mostly, as the seating was limited. But overall, a great place for veg lunch/ dinner."
3.5,"I had gone there with a friend. We found the food very very tasty, the service was quick and the staff was attentive.  All in all a good experience.  Quantity of food, that is, portion size can be a little larger. The pricing is quite good, but the portion size left us wanting.  Try this place once for sure, because reading reviews and eating and experiencing for yourself are taste buds apart."
2.5,Went here couple of times.. Food is ok ok.. not worth standing on a queue for an hour just to get inside. Staff and service is also Ok.. I don't have any specific complaint here but I would prefer to go for other restaurant to have veg food rather than here.
4.0,"Great taste of food. Even though you've to wait a little, new kind of drink can make you feel refreshing again."
4.0,Such a nice concept of giving u a feeling as though u r having food in a village..the name says it all..they serve u well n gravy tastes so gud
4.0,We are regulars at this restaurant and have always left the place happy and satisfied. It does get too crowded on weekends. The restaurant has been newly renovated and looks nice with a village type decor. The food is fresh without preservatives. They have a wide range of vegetarian gravies and all of them are yummy. The service is courteous and fast. Their lime soda is absolutely fabulous! A must visit place for authentic vegetarian food that is modestly priced.
4.0,"Gramin is best suited to you, if you're tired and want to ditch cooking for a day. Its simple 'ghar ka khana' menu and the awesome taste, provides you with a good option for a change of taste. The food is slightly on the spicy side. There is waiting queue here more often than not. The best thing is that upstairs, you can sit cross-legged and eat. Tip: Do try the jal-zeera here."
4.0,"Although I am not very fond of veg food still this place has managed to revisit it more than twice.. Authentic veg food in rajasthani style. They serve in co[[er plates and glasses and you ll be able to listen old mid 80's songs! Hell lot of options for a pure veg restaurant. I don't miss to have their nimbu shikanji and sweet lassi! Very cheap and very good food. Veg people, if you are struggling to find a good place there you go!"
1.0,"Not up to the mark according to the popularity it has. Worst in cleanliness... Had to make them change the dirty plates a hell lot of times, which is inconsiderable..."
1.0,Glasses are always dirty. And staff is not at all responsible
1.0,Bad experience.
5.0,No words to Express about this restaurant... Superb service and too good food... Place is too small but they have accommodated properly.. Most of vegetarians love this resto... Always waiting but it worth... Love to visit atleast once or twice in a month... What ever you order it will be good... As I mentioned before there will be waiting for almost 30 mins...                                                                 bangaloreepicure.com
3.0,Crowded. I hate to wait to eat.  Food is just average.
3.5,The place is very shabby and smelly now... I understand it to be a tiny place but what happened to that earlier charm of the place... May be I have been there 5 to 6 times.. But recently was shocked to see them down with quantity of food and place... This place is not worth it now...
1.0,"Went here with great expectations and came back irritated. As we entered, we were pleased to notice some nice, clean and rustic interiors. Amazing songs of the 50s-60s were playing at an appropriate loudness.  We ordered a Masala Papad, Paneer Kolhapuri (indicated as double spicy on the menu), Dal Fry, Butter Naan and Rotis.  The Masala Papad arrived with finely chopped onion and not-so-finely-chopped tomatoes. Looked like they made it in a hurry.  Then came the main course we were looking forward to.  On first bite, my immediate reaction was - Panner Kolhapuri is not cooked. It felt like the cook had thrown paneer pieces in a raw tomato puree and added some red chilly powder and just mixed them together. The tomatoe puree tasted raw, the red chilly paste tasted raw and powdery in the gravy. Paneer was not soft either. Water was oozing out of the raw uncooked gravy (see photo). The dish was a big big let down and made us regret our choice of restaurant.  I called the waiter and reported my observation on the Paneer Kolhapuri. Waiter (in extreme indifference and defensive but rude tone): Khaya bhi nahi aur complaint kar rahey ho (You have not even eaten the dish and are complaining). Me: I have eaten it. Why don't you listen to what I have to say. The gravy is not cooked at all. It is raw. Waiter: Aisa hi banta hai ye dish (This dish is always made like this - that's our way). Me: Please try it yourself and check how spicy it should be and whether it qualifies to be called a fully cooked gravy.  The waiter did not speak a word and took away the gravy and within 2 minutes another server came back with the same gravy but re-done in a pan with some oil and  a dry red chilly. This refurbished version was not great (was unreasonably salty and tangy) either but we had to eat what we had ordered and help ourselves out of this unbearable place asap.  The Dal Fry was not a North Indian Dal Fry at all. It was sweet and had all South Indian flavours to it.  In the end, utterly disappointed, we left the place with a bill of Rs. 420/-. The number 420 (Indian Penal Code for cheating and false promises) aptly signifies the experience we had at this rude and unapologetic place.  No thanks, I will never visit again."
3.5,"A good place to have north indian veg food but little heavy on your pockets for a vegetarian meal.some dishes like dal afgani , chatpata panner are good ."
3.5,"Gramin is THE place to have authentic North Indian food,they also have recipes specially for Jains(without garlic and onion).The place is great to try out rich Indian food at it's best. I have visited this place a couple of times and the food has been great  Location:The restaurant is located in Raheja Arcade near Forum.It is better to get there a little early as the place tends to get crowded very fast,especially on weekends.  Food: They have a lot of variety in terms of rotis and subziyan.The good is served in brass plates and glasses  Must try: Harabhara Kebab:Great choice for starters The Jajjeera and Masala Buttermilk are great drinks to wash down your meal All the parathas are soft and great,I particluarly likes the Butter Methi Paratha and the Aloo Paratha  They do have a wide variety of Subziyan to choose from  Some of my favorites are Navaratna Kurma,Kofta Methi Malai Mutter,Paneer Butter Masala and the Double Tadka Dal  Ambiance:The whole place has been set up like a village(Gramin) with mud walls and village style setting on the top Price:Great value for money  Once I took my friend who isn't from India and she fell in love with Indian food.So Gramin is a great place to go to at all times.                                             alittlebitofcaro.wordpress.com"
2.0,"Gramin has always been one of my favorite place to dine is specially if m dinning out with a colleague or friend. I had visited this restaurant after 4-5 months or maybe more than that. they have changed the decors, i liked the earlier ones more.  Yesterday was a disaster for me, had taken a close friend out to gramin as he is pure vegetarian and loves north indian food.  Disaster started when the host came to our table after 15 mins. which i believe is a very long time. I just ignored it it because i believed that they seem to be packed.  We didn't order much just methi mali paneer and rotis n a naan. I think that was a very small order but still they took lot of time to bring food till the table. I was still in the notion that we can ignore it lets enjoy the food.  But I am sorry yesterday they were extremely bad with the food. paneer was very hard,they gravy did not contain the same taste moreover it seemed that they have just made something which contains meethi malai n paneer but didn't taste well at all...they might have grown huge but now they are not able to maintain themselves.   on top of that the rotis we got they were not fully baked. Towards the end it had become joke, the finger bowl had cold water.  I have always liked the restaurant and taken a lot of people with me friends family n colleague, but yesterday i was embarrassed when my friend asked me is it really a good restaurant.  The restaurant needs to give a come back."
5.0,"Greetings fellow foodies..!!  I am back after a long time (needed couple of days to settle down in new city) with my direct review-reporting of ""Gramin"".  Frankly speaking this restaurant was on my radar since my first visit to ""City of Gardens"" in 2012, but wasn't able to put up with my ""wish"" due to one or other commitment OR in other words,  you can say ""Fate"" wanted me to visit this restaurant with my wife :)  As the gas connection wasn't installed @ our new abode, we decided to venture out @ my ""Wishlist, i.e. Gramin"".  The place is in ""Raheja Arcade"" which was landmark place once upon a time in Koramangala 5th block diagonally opposite to ""Forum Mall"".  First thing which surprised me: though we have the restaurant in premises of ""Raheja Arcade"", the security guard charged me Rs. 30 for the parking (later came to know that this is a standard scene in almost all parts of Bengalooru whether it's a movie or shopping or dining).  Talking of ambience @ the place: It is nicely tucked in a central part of ""Raheja Arcade"" (@Ground Floor) with a decent & ""True-To-Its-Name"" gramin/village environment.  Now, we took our seats and ordered the ""Starter: Baby Corn Paneer Allahabadi"", opted this starter because it was marked as ""Jain"" (i.e. without ""Onion & Garlic"").   Why ""Jain"" ???? Because ""Chaitra Navratri"" was going on & as ""Brahmins"" we can't eat ""Pyaaz"" & ""Garlic"" during this auspicious 9 days.   *** As soon as ""Starter"" was served, I threw a ""Devilish"" but ""Sumptous"" smile across my ""Better Half"" which meant ""Today we were gonna be a witness to  one of the best ""Jhakaas"" & ""Delicious"" Food Experience"" of our ""Life"" ***  The ""Starter"" consisted of ""Mutter"", ""Paneer"" dices & ""Baby Sweet Corns"" cooked in a ""Tandoor"" (nice one)....  For the ""Main Course"" we ordered ""Laccha Paratha's"" (staple fare with us) along with ""Gramin  Kofta"" (which again was a ""Jain"" option but very good).  ""Kofta"" were too hard (may be because they were ""Gramin"" or don't know, but would give ""Benefit-of-Doubt"" to the chef); but if the ""Kofta"" would have carried some more ""Moman"" or ""Ghee"" or ""Olive Oil"" along with ""Red/Green Chilli Paste"" in it, they would have ""Tasted"" much-much better.   After a long-long time, I had ""Laccha"" Paratha's which can be termed  ""Laccha Paratha"" in true sense; Very Nostalgic I would say.  All in all, it was an ""Awesome"" Experience when I paid the bill of just ""399"" bucks, excluding a ""Tip"" & ""Parking Fee ;).   List of ""150+ reviews"" on their side, ""Gramin"" Team is here to rock....I will surely visit this place in near future.   *** A flying birdie told me that, they also have a first floor sitting which is better than the ambience/sitting/tables of ground floor. Will surely give it a shot. ***"
4.5,"Bustling. Busy, cozy ambience. Good service and exceptional food."
2.5,"I visited Gramin on a weekday with my friend, my friend wanted to go somewhere else, but I had read some good reviews of this place so dragged him into this place.  Lassi, harabarra kebab were good, rest, paratha, the curry that we ordered wasn't good actually."
3.5,"we went to gramin for dinner on a weekend. as we reached there late night we didnt have the problem of waiting;-). we ordered hara bara kabab, crispy baby corn for starters. hara bara kabab was good but the crispy baby corn was more towards the soggy side. the main course was good and i love the masal buttermilk there. the food was good and their price were amazing. very pocket friendlyB-). the ambience was also good. we chose the 1st floor seating and the low height table were really fun. u could stretch ur leg and sit comfortably. we were first attended by a very serious and not so friendly waiter. then later we got a very friendly waiter who was very friendly and pleasant.  overall... its a good place, with good food. :-)"
4.5,Excellent food. I would definitely pay more for the taste. Very few places with this good 'veg' food. Complete value for money. The cost makes my rating go from 4 to 4.5. The only disappointment is ambiance. It is not as good but still for a foodie worth a visit.
4.5,"Even though being a pure non-veg guy, I loved this place. Quality food. Veg ppl out there , do check this place. Worth it. :)"
3.0,Ambience was great but food was a bit too spicy. Prices were also a bit exaggerated for the lassi.
3.0,We along with one of our friends went to Gramin for lunch on weekend. The Ambience is good.   We asked for veg thali but they said it is not available on weekends. So we ordered Gramin special briyani and Handi Paneer. Briyani is bit spicy. Handi Paneer is OK.  Space is very small. You have to wait to get the seat. Price is moderate for the quantity they provide. Over all OK. Can be tried once if you want to have veg.
4.5,Paneer butter masala is my all time favourite and i should say that i had the tastiest paneer butter masala in this place!!!! The price is reasonable and worthy....Thank you for serving us great food with good attention...!!
1.0,"Can't believe how this restaurant got so much positive reviews.  Chaos every where - sitting arrangement, quality of service, taste of food.  Only good thing about this is very light on pocket."
3.5,"This is one of the very few good places for vegetarians. We visited this place for lunch after our classes. tried a variety starter made of bhendi. it was different. main course was also good. Interior has a village feel to it. Being located at prime location in kormangala, this place attracts lot of foodies, and often is crowded. U can order food outside and do shopping while u wait for ur turn!  Food - 4 Ambience - 3 Value - 3.5"
3.0,"I go to a pure veg restaurant when I'm hosting someone and the person is pure veg. We reached late in afternoon, so there was a queue but smartly enough they were taking orders while you wait. ambiance was reflecting the name of the restaurant, nice touch. we ordered masala papad, lasuni paneer dhuandar. Masala papad was let down as it had only tomato and onion on top of it. there was no masala in it. Paneer starter was good. It was paneer sandwiched between slice on onion and capsicum. but the capsicum and onion was not grilled that properly. I felt it was added after grilling paneer. Main we ordered  Bhindi anardana: it was nice, masala was tasty oerfect but bhindi was not that crispy as I was expecting. Handi paneer: This dish also is was good, only problem was chilly used. It was overpowering the flavor. dum aloo masaledar: at first look I felt it might taste same as handi paneer but the gravy was tasting quiet different and it was good. sadly they didn't had phulkas which I was expecting when you name your restaurant as grameen. we ordered tandoori roti which was also good. Service is prompt and attentive. over all okay experience and would have been towards better side if the chilly used was less, so that we could enjoy the taste. Might be a good place for pure veg eaters. I'm always a bit strict on veg restaurants."
5.0,I visit this place when i feel like being at home.  I feel like angel: Tasty food. Quantity is amazing. Prices are more than reasonable.  Don't Unleash the Devil in Me: Only thing is parking. But that can be managed as there is parking available at the back of the restaurent. (two wheeler only).  A must visit for vegetarian... (non veg is not available)
3.5,"I have been to Gramin about twice in the past 2-3 months. Though the space is quite limited, they have tried to create a great ambience. Once, I came with a friend and the food was quite spicy but when I tried again with my family 2 weeks back, we really enjoyed the food.   We had ordered for tomato soups, Paneer Malai tikka for starters, Gramin Daal, Kadhai Paneer, Malai Kofta, Pineapple Raita, Pindi Choley and Naans for 8 people. Pindi Choley was awesome. Haven't eaten this kind of choley since leaving Delhi.. Yes, it was that good. Overall, a good experience."
3.0,"The rating and the reviews made me drive my way with a couple of friends to this place on a weekend evening. Somehow I came back with handful of disappointments.  My order ranged from the starters to the main course to the add-ons but not much of pleasure I had with the taste.  Yeah, I do appreciate that their crispy fried babycorn and lassi were amazing but kulcha, veg kadai, paneer tikka or the soups we ordered were just average,  Ambiance - 3/5 Service - 3.5/5 Rate Card - Economical : 3/5 Food - 2.5/5"
3.5,"So Gramin comes as a one-stop North-Indian Vegan place for many. A life saviour for some and a great kindish place for others. The places in one word can be summarized as decent. The food is nice and ambiance makes you feel comfy, service does not complement the food but still, pass.   Continue here : http://zomato.arpanramtek.com/blog/2014/02/19/gramin-koramangalabangalore/  The place has a very distinct interior (good for snaps), although in the middle of a complex; it still manages to be felt Gramin i.e. village like. Bronze glasses, steel plates, green mats, mud-brick walls and a few more traditional touches here and there (check snaps). 2 sittings zones are neatly divided into Ground and 1st floor. First floor is more recent and was opened a few years ago; closes at 10. You can still squeeze in the ground floor before 10:30.   The menu is well spread out but lacks charisma ( no up-selling tricks up their sleeve) , could have been better designed than just words crammed in a few pages. Somethings have been recently taken off the menu but they might still serve if you insist. There's no air-conditioning here but still feels wonderful, grab a 'aam ka pana' if you've been out in the sun. Hygiene is fine and everything else feels alright. You don't get napkins here, just use one of the table napkins they give or better if you can carry your own.   All of the critique brain aside, the food is good and nothing is broken/bent to please the eye. The Sabzi is something which will exceed expectations, pulses are good and the taste is savory. The quantity of food is generous (I didn't understand the logic but still, too much). A slight personal disappointment that they don't serve Phulkas here, anyways i find they increase my appetite a good 2.5 times of normal. Given that you eat the  Tandoori Roti/ Naan hot, it would not be a deal breaker. Achaar/ Onions served on the side. Recommend Sabzi ka saalan which is a melange of much.   All this said, none of the reviewer's opinions or mine should stop you from creating your own; it's definitely worth one shot! Happy munchin!                                             eatoutdevout.com"
3.5,A tasty meal at vary affordable prices.  Perfect for students on a budget who wish to eat some good north indian food. The curries taste good but their biryani and other types of rice dishes taste better. The place is small and  is always crowded. A value for money kinda meal.
4.0,"Great place if you want to try tasty vegetarian occasionally. Apart from parking problem (it is difficult to find the entrance for the restaurant) I see no limitations. It is indeed Gramin right from the menu, serving, glasses and food. Seating are not that comfortable but when you start having starters, shikanji and other food items, you will forget all those. Items are decently priced and affordable. This is a better place to visit if you are going along with team for lunch or dinner. I think, as it is located near Forum, which has variety of eat-outs, Gramin is losing its charm and customers."
4.5,"Woahhh..2nd vegetarian restaurant in a month. I have visited Gramin a lot many times but yesterday was special. We were a huge group of 10 people(all of them foodies, obviously) & it was a birthday treat. We had made the reservation and being Monday could hop into our seats very soon. Gramin is so well located, you can never miss it.  You enter the restaurant and you can actually see the bucolic view of Northern India. The ambiance is so rustic, you feel like your eating in a (modern)village. The seats can be a bit more comfortable, otherwise its quite comfy. The music they play is perfect, yesterday it was all ""Devanand"" & ""kishore Kumar"" special. They have so exhaustive menu. I think they have tweaked a lot of food courses to tend to a larger crowd. We ordered ""TAWA CORN PEAS"". Corn & Peas perfectly fried and served with chaat masala on them. Good combo. Next on our table was ""STUFFED ALOO"" & ""PANEER MALAI KABAB"". Potato pieces stuffed with cheese and baked in tandoor, amazing stuff. Cottage Cheese in soaked in Malai served with so auspiciousness. Thank God for Tandoor, even Paneer can taste ""finger licking good"". Some friends had ordered soup which were decent too. Corn Soup was really good. Just the way I like it. ""Sweet"". Then came the main course, ah! Paneer again, but my my it didn't disappoint. PANEER TIKKA MASALA. Cubes of Paneer Tikka cooked with a tangy tomato gravy. DAL AFGHANI, just like Dal Makhani, but better. And there was NAVRATAN KORMA, with a lots of Khoa( ricotta cheese ), very sweet but definitely mouth watery. For drinks, we got recommended for PUDINA KHATTA MEETHA, which they challenged to cancel if its not good, and so they did. Cheers to that! LASSI, MASALA CHAACH are good, though we expected AAM PANNA which wasn't available :(  And all this with lots of breads (Kulcha, Lacha Paratha, Roti, Ah!) cost us only 2100 bucks. Shocking!  Definitely a must visit, veg restaurant, amazingly priced and super tasty food! 0.5 deducted for Non-Veg ;)  Food - 5/5  Ambiance - 5/5  Service - 4/5  VFM - 5/5"
4.5,"GRAMIN is always been a saviour for my hunger. Whenevr you are reaally hungery, and want to have good food yet not expensive, just walk in here.  This is located inside Raheja Arcade Building which is at Forum Signal, 7th Block Kormangala. Ambiance is quite tradinational style specially small sofa on 1st floor.  Food is excellent. Must try Aam Panna ( if its available..:P). Staff is good..well manner. You visit this place if you are near Forum Mall.  You might have to wait if you go on weekends..:("
3.0,"I ordered lehsooni paneer tikka, it was simple and dint have any special flavour of lehsoon in it.. The food is average.. Had to wait for 45 minutes to get a table. The cutlery is village like to create 'gramin' ambiance. All in all i think it is a bit over rated."
3.0,"This was my third visit to Gramin and must say it wasnt as pleasant as the first 2 visits. The food no doubt is very. Loved the paneer kurkure, crispy baby corn and some bhendi starter that w all loved. The only disappointment was the service. The waiter wasnt very friendly ( I would say he was rather rude ) and the gravies came in first and the bread basket took a very long time. We had ordered for a gulab jamun plate each and the waiter decided that we should share and not take one each.  Overall, apart from the service really loved the taste and quality of food and the ambience is decent."
3.5,I had heard a lot about Gramin. So I decided to check out the place for myself. What did I find out? That the place is not worth going to again.
4.5,"A pure veg. restaurant which churns out delicious Indian food at affordable rates. The ambience is very simple and without frills but the food is a treat for the taste buds. You must try the butter milk or the lassi here. Also the stuffed parathas & stuffed kulchas should not be missed. The range of vegetable dishes, paneer preparations and dals is very vast and you are bound to find your choice somewhere in there. Furthermore, some items in the menu are marked as ""available in Jain preparation on request"" which I think is a very nice option to have. There is usually a waiting line here on weekends but you can place the order while waiting. So literally within two minutes of getting your table, the gastronomical adventure can begin. Fantastic value for money, tasty food, simple ambience, little bit of waiting all makes for a lovely meal!!"
4.5,"This place never lets you down. And touch wood, it's really 'inflation proof'. They have mastered the idea of maintaining food quality and quantity but also keeping prices nominal. Only thing is that they don't have home delivery. Sometimes waiting time for a table become 1 hour. So, if they can introduce home delivery, that would be great!  EDIT (in 2014): Got to know of a startup: Swiggy.in which now delivers food from Gramin at our doorstep. Yay!!  Another Edit (in 2017!): Swiggy no more delivers from this place as they are no more a small startup and demand higher cut from Gramin. But ""Runnr"" app delivers from this place."
2.0,"Went to Gramin after a gap of 5 years... used to love the place for the neat place,good food that it offered but was so disappointed with both the quality of the food as well as the hygiene, the mats on the table smelled ,the food was not so tasty, the plates were not so clean either............will never visit this place again!!!"
1.0,"This restaurant definitely does not deserve the 3.6 average rating it received. I am a vegetarian and I was excited to find this joint near home. I was absolutely disappointed and had to pen my first Zomato review to express my opinion. Paneer was extremely rubbery, soup was cold, main course curries were so bad, I had to come home and take some antacid to keep stuff down. If you want  a good vegetarian place, easy on your stomach, visit the one down the road, its called Sanjeevanam. Please skip this one and save yourself the hype and the upset stomach. The only decent thing about the hotel was the Lassi."

The only problem is that on weekend it overflows so be prepared to wait atleast half an hour to get a table..  Definitely would recommend this place to others.."
4.0,"Have been going to Gramin since 2005 and must say the decor is the same till date. The food has been good since then except for a few dishes which have changed. Some good dishes have gone off the menu, but we still order it. Love the dal kolhapuri, aloo mirchi, kesar lassi, hara bara kebab. Overall good food period."
3.5,An affordable North Indian eatery. Unique khatta meetha pudina drink and awesome paneer dishes.  Dal makhani is not that great..and jeera rice is mostly jeera pulao...However the portions were quite well served and enough for 2 people..Nice ambience and great service. Beware of waiting time here..however you can pre order while waiting for your table and the order is served quickly..
4.5,"Gramin is a place I used to frequent when I lived close to Koramangala. Each time I have gone with different set of people in large groups, a smaller group and some times just 2 or 3 people, but always had a fantastic time. The decor is rustic and even the menu card gives a rustic feel. I have my favorites here, so I always go for the jal jeera paani, which is probably one of the best I have tasted in Bangalore. I usually go for paneer tikka as a starter. I have tasted lasooni paneer duadar, ajwain paneer tikka and tandoor paneer platter on different visits. And every time they just tasted yum. For main course, I usually go for handi biriyani or gramin biriyani. On few visits I have also had kulchas and side dishes (can't remember them). But what I can remember is every time I went there, came out absolutely satisfied.  It is very reasonably priced and given the fact it is located in a prime area, it is a wonder that they are able to offer such delicious food at affordable prices. Hope to go there soon some time!  Friday evenings can be really crowded, so you may have to wait for some time. But definitely the wait is worth."
1.5,"Went to this place with our little daughter on our anniversary. Ordered Dum Aloo and rotis. Dum Aloo is a Kashmiri dish. I previously had it years ago in Pune in Gujarti Mess. I had absolutely loved it then.   What we were served here was pathetic boiled aloo (potato) with tasteless gravy. It was so bad we hardly were able to finish it. There was nothing authentic about it. It seemed boiled potatoes (aloos) were added to some common gravy and served.  I expected at least gravy to be rich but it was poorly made. Very very terrible.  I have a suggestion for Gramin: Instead of listing 100 things on menu and preparing only handful of them well, list only those items you can prepare very well. Else customers will give bad feedback.  I don't much care about ambiance as long as place is clean and well lit.   Price: Decent (100Rs per person for 4 rotis and Dum Aloo) Taste: Very average Freshness: Only rotis were fresh. Dum Aloo Gravy seemed pretty stale and reheated."
3.5,"Gramin at kormangla is one of the oldest eating place for north indian food I have know since year 2005. The ambiance is quite rustic and gives me a good feel of my homeland Rajasthan. If you are looking for good vegetarian food and perhaps a jain food, this place will not disappoint your taste buds.  I was keen on having something Rajasthani in my dinner so I selected Rajasthani Bhindi, Banjara Paneer Tikka, Garlic Chutney, Missi Roti, Kadi Kofta, Jeera rice, Double Tadka Daal along with Veg Balti as we were three of us.  The food here was good and satisfying. The pricing is great and won't affect your wallet much.  You visit this place if you are near Forum Mall. My rating Food 4/5 Service 3/5 Ambiance 3/5 Overall 3.5 /5                                                                 thefoodietales.com"
3.5,"Gramin being around for ages is a well-known fact (for me atleast). I've eaten here maybe twice or thrice and have been pretty satisfied with their food. What clinches the deal for Gramin is their amazing value-for-money priced menu. The world around has exponentially increased prices, but here you'd get a tasty satisfying meal for a fraction of that price. For vegetarians and people who like jain food, this is a good place to go.  Since a friend asked for good vegetarian food, 3 of us landed here for dinner last week on a weekday. Gramin has ample space and seating, so we went upstairs to sit. Looking at their menu, I like the part of them mentioning ""Spicy"", ""Light - Diet"" and ""Jain on request"" for dishes. We all love spicy food, so I first asked for a Soda Hari Mirch. :D Really wanted to know what it tastes like. For starters, we asked for Corn Soup,  Ajwain Paneer Tikka and Masala Papad. My soda was good! I loved the subtle mirchi hit in the soda. They put a slit green chilli in the soda as well as wedged one on the rim of the glass. The soup was pretty decent and the papad was great. I don't relish masala papads that much for the reason being they are always served soggy and soft. But here, it was crisp, light and spicy. The paneer tikka was served in a covered dish which has a bowl of coals in the centre. Interesting I must say. Loved the idea. The green chutney served for the tikkas was awesomely spicy! The paneer was soft and delicious and the grilled capsicum was crisp.  For mains, we chose a roti and a stuffed kulcha with Daal Makahani and mixed raita to share among us. The kulcha was stuffed with soft paneer and really filling. It may have lacked a bit of punch in the taste, but it was fine with me. The daal was pretty decent too, but it wasn't served hot. The raita wasn't sour which was another plus point.   On the whole, a very decent meal. What we were boggled about was the bill - 550/- only! Tell me you've eaten somewhere else with friends and had a fulfilling meal for this price. I somehow doubt it. And by the time we left, people were already waiting in a queue. I need say no more.. :)"
1.0,Really bad experience dining at gramin. Food can be managable but the behavior of the employee really sucks. Not going to visit this place again. Thanks a lot.
5.0,"Best option for economical, North Indian vegetarian food in Bangalore. Apart from the huge waiting on weekends, it has the best ambience and service. Serves the most delicious food:-)"
3.0,"This is decent North Indian restaurant at a good location. The decoration and the ambiance was more like a Rajasthani one. On weekends, there is mostly a long queue outside. And once you get inside, the place is a little cramped. Too many tables in too less space. And if someone orders a smoking platter, chances are there will be people coughing all around because of the smoke. The food quality is just alright, nothing great. I got bored in the third time itself. On a positive note. the rates are very reasonable. And the service is good and quick. Going there once in a while is good, but it's not a place you would want to visit too often."

3.5,Awesome food n ambience...veg haven for vegetarians. ..
4.0,"Have been a regular to this places for many years.   The main theme initially here was to serve food that's available in the villages less oily and spicy. My dad use to love this place for its light food. Over the years the food quality remained more or less same. It's gotten more spicy, no complains. The starters are a delight, especially the drinks. Kesar Lassi is amazing. Main course is nice with a wide selection for varied tastes. Handi Panner Masala is standout.  Overall a nice place that has maintained its quality over the years."
4.0,"Hi All,  Had been to gramin quite a few times and had always liked it thus decided to take my wife out for dinner on a weekday. Located at Koramangala 7th block inside Raheja Arcade. the interiors are very earthy with wall hangings and earthen pots designs on the walls. The place is small but service is quick. I have never waited till date therefore i cannot say what happens in their waiting area below.  For Drinks which they call Thanda Thanda we had Jaljeera and Aam Ka Panna Starter : Tandoori Paneer Platter which tasted pretty good   Main Course we had Rotis and Gramin Kofta and Veg Handi which tasted good  Overall: Always a good experience at gramin"
4.0,"A bit cramped, but the food here beats some of the more expensive restaurants around.   The jaljeera an buttermilk are perfect companions for your food. We tried a few curries and roti, along with the usual rice combination. Food was cooked very well and the prices were fair. A must visit for vegetarians if you happen to be in the vicinity. Parking beware though; so best leave your vehicle in forum and take a walk."
4.5,"On a weekday afternoon to have some filling and fantabulous north indian lunch...  U should really try out Gramin. Very easily reachable in koramangala. Inside raheja arcade this pure veg restaurant satisfies you and makes you wanting for more once your hungry again, :-P  As I love vegetarian dishes and give it a higher priority and I see to it the food is best when it comes to veg and visited this place with a group of friends for lunch. Really small restaurant and mostly crowded due to heavy floating area. But we got a table after 5 mins luckily.  Talking about food jaljeera which was averagely good. Then coming to the starters we had ordered a panner one the (name of which I dont remember)which was really good and in good quantity. Then coming to the mains we wanted something really spicy and ordered for a veg kohlapuri. One of the famous dishes here as my friend told me. We wanted another subzi and asked for suggestions, then ordered for do subzi pyaza. As we were 4 of us the portions of the gravies was enough and the quantity was satisfying. As they hav marked it as spicy....  It really waaas....  Coming to the ambience and service .... Nothing to give a special mention nor anything bad. A great experience in Grahmin. Prices are really moderate and perfect for the quantity and taste they put in those dishes. So its a place were u can visit very often and leave with a satisfied tummy.:-D Atleast we did :-) I will visit again and again :-)  RATING  Ambiance - 3.5 / 5  Food - 4.5 / 5  Service - 4 / 5  VFM - 5 / 5"
4.0,"Located at a very convenient place.  Pretty impressed by the management here, you won't mind waiting for the table as they are going to serve the food as soon as you get seated (one can place the orders while waiting for the table).  Ambience is good.  Food is what needs some improvement. Wont mind paying  a little extra for better food."
1.0,I surely dont recommend anyone to eat in gramin . . I got a cockroach in my plate . . God saved me . . I found it before eating :-D
4.0,"This is the second time, I visited this place. Good North Indian Food. Must say ""Authentic"". The ambience had the Village-ish touch. I love spicy food. The food had exact amount of spice which made me enjoy every bite. Spicy Masala Butter Milk was way too tasty...Keep it going1!!"
3.5,"A place located inside Raheja Arcade, near Forum in Koramangala, great location and very easy to find. Have had a lot of references from vegetarian friends.   The ambiance totally goes with the name. Although nothing elaborate but there were the copper mugs and glasses that was quite earthy, the place is extremely packed in lunch hours as we found it. The good thing is you can order beforehand to cut the time. The prices are extremely reasonable and the quantity good. Other than the usual paneer and koftas you also get veg varieties like baigan bharta and bhindi. I being far from home felt extremely delighted at those.  The food was good in taste, quite a few variety in rotis as well. I did love the music though. The long lost songs of 60s playing behind, It went well with the environment. The service is courteous and efficient. One thing must to have is the lassi. Quite a lot actually for after a meal but it so completes the whole thing. In the end i did wish of elastic pants. Good place to go."
3.0,"This must be like a paradise for veggies in Kormangala. I like to go there once in a while. Its only the huge crowd & congested ambience that puts me off, otherwise it's a good restaurant for North Indian food at a moderate cost.  I love their lachcha paratha, Palak paneer, mutter paneer, dal fry & raitha. I am not a great fan of harabara kabab, tried only once it was just okayish.   I fell severely sick once after trying malai kofta there. It was too sweet & heavy and tasted weird for some reason. And the items there are not tasting as good as they did once."
4.5,"A value for money restaurant. Lovely ambience. Food & service is great. A well behaved staff. A must try restaurant in Bangalore. If you visit this place : ""Karela Masala with Chilly Parantha "" a must on your platter.    Just loved it !"
3.5,"Gramin located at Koramangala 7 th block in the Raheja Aracade opposite the Vodafone store has been under my radar for far too long now. But somehow Gramin has been synonymous to the famous quote by Thomas A Edison for me which goes like ""We often miss opportunity because it's dressed in overalls and looks like hard work . The place always has such a huge crowd waiting to enter. I am a restless soul. To get me to wait for food when I am in the queue behind 15 to 20 families is impossible.  So last week on a Tuesday night after work was when my friends and I while pondering over where to eat happened to cross by and decided on this very place as there was no queue.  As the name goes the place is very village-ish. That is not even a word. I bet you stopped reading. Alright Jokes apart. The look and feel is very earthen. The rugged mud like walls as that of a hut a.k.a Kuchha House which we were taught in 2nd Grade was a great choice on their part as that indeed instills the exact feeling of visiting an eatery at a rural area. The nick knacks hung are a notable add on to the ambience. The food was being served in copper cutlery at the other tables. Back at Home we store water in Copper Jugs and this was owing to the fact Copper came with a lot of benefits to the circulatory and the nervous system. Usage of Copper utensils has been a practice followed from ancient times.  So after a quick look on the Menu , we decided on a Basket of Rotis and Gramin Kofta Curry.For refreshers my friends chose Butter Milk and a Spicy Butter Milk. The basket of Rotis consists of Roti, Lacha Paratha , Methi Roti and Butter Naan. One of each is served . This is a great bet if you have arrived with a good apetite. For us its was perfect.  The best among them for me personally was the Lacha Paratha.The rest of the items were good as well. Before ordering the curry there was a round table conference on what to order as all three of us are very particular about certain things out of which one being that the gravy should NOT be sweet and that is how Malai Kofta got ruled out.After enquiring with the wait staff and being told that the Gramin Kofta would be spicy and not sweet , we took the plunge. I would never say the curry was spicy . It was definitely very tangy. The kofta balls were soft.Did I Love it? Not so much . Nonetheless tasted decent with the Rotis.  The Buttermilk which I fret from ordering as I have had several EPIC fails in places that I have been to . But after being forced by my friend to try it for her sake , I had a gulp and it was so good! I finished half her glass .   The service was not exceptional. Despite an easy night and a ton lot of servers. There was a delay in the food being brought. Napkins were not provided. Everything had to be asked for which is something that irks you and I right? But they were courteous so I am going to  quit the rant.  The meal cost us 334 Rs inclusive of taxes . The basket of Rotis cost us 105 RS which I think is quite a steal.The Gramin Kofta curry , Buttermilk and the Spicy Butter Milk amounted to 110, 35 and 40 RS respectively. The prices are decent.   One very fun fact about this place. The music they play. I was literally taken back to the 90's as they played old Hindi hits like ""Tu Cheez Badi haiMast"", ""Choti Choti Asha"" , Tip Tip Barsa "" .I havent heard these songs in ages. Listening to good old music over a meal is definitely something anybody loves.   Pros : The Ambience The Music  The food  Cons:  Slightly Dingy Inconsistent service.  I had a good meal . After an exhausting day at work all I wanted for was some good food which would facilitate deep slumber and the meal here ensured that. As they say ""Once the tummies are full the heart is content"". I was too , so were my friends. Missing the North ? Missing the good old 90's ? Wanna experience the Village right here in Urban Bangalore . Head to Gramin . They will cater to all three listed.   Eat Hearty!! :)"
2.5,"Have been here thrice now. It's painful to see the place losing its taste in terms of authenticity and service. Usually I decide to go here when I crave for a simple north indian food, but I was extremely disappointed this last time. Probably, hope to see it regaining its flavor when I visit next, which is certainly not coming soon."
4.0,"Gramin has been around for quite some time now. For years it was my go to for yummy north indian food. Over the years they have managed to keep up their taste and service, never disappointed. Whether you go in a group or in pairs there is seating for you on two floors. But unfortunately this can sometime turn insufficient for the rush of people that turn up! The waiters and the ambiance gives you that feeling hat you are in North India in a classy place. the plates and glasses they use add to the feel.  Whether you order their thaali or individual dishes, I promise you that disappointment is nowhere near! Personally I love their thaali, masala papad, sweets , lassi and buttermilk!"
1.0,"The standard has dropped big time... used to be average bout 6 months ago, but they have dropped below recently. ate last night - sheek kebab it was spicy, and ..smelly! tandai- was so good last time but now it was just dead and didn't have the tang. The small things like onion rings were completely dead like they had cut that last night. the main course was simply miserable... spicy was obnoxiously spicy and nothing else. non spicy dishes..well ..spicy again. well that's a goodbye gramin!"
1.0,I have no Idea how this restaurant is rated so high. Absolutely tasteless food !!  I've only tried the thali here and a few times and every time I promise myself never to visit again.   Also it does not help that I have to pass the rear end of their kitchen to get to my workplace.   Very low rating on Hygiene.

4.0,"Gramin has been a favourite since not one or 2 but almost a decade now. The restaurant is efficient, clean and nicely done and serves delicious food. With price, location, vegetarian only, nice and fast service this is the place we default to when we need quick, good, vegetarian Indian meal with a glass of my favourite, Thandai.   Would I visit again: can't count the number of times I have been here Would I recommend it (if you care for it): yes"
3.5,"It was our team mate birthday and he decided to treat us in Gramin . We were 8 in number . This place is on the main road and you can easily spot it . As you enter inside the hotel , you can see the place decorated in Rajasthani and Gujarathi style . Ambiance was good. We were asked to take a table at  the corner . To make it look like  a village they have put small chairs which people generally use in village .   We started ordering food . Papad , Jaljeera (good), Tawa corn peas (Really good ), chatpata babaycorn paneer (average), Roti basket (assorted works out well if you are going in  a group ),Kaju masala (very good) ,paneer Tikka masala , veg pulao , dal and Jamoon . Taste-wise they were all good  . Bill was around 1400 or so .  Food : 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambiance:4/5 VFM: 4/5 Something new: 1 /5  It's NOT a Must Try place . But if you are staying close by , you can grab your lunch here . Pretty decent service and would not burn a hole in your pocket.  But few advices : 1.If you are tall , avoid sitting on those small chairs. It's really hard to sit on those .  2.For papad if you don't like chilli powder on tomatoes , do tell them before .( But i like it that way). 3. This place is good , but don't expect an amazing food experience . The menu is just normal."
3.5,"You should go this place 'just' for their food... Crowded place with long waiting time, but their north indian food makes it worth d pain...i tried the paneer tikka platter, soft delicios cubes of panner marinated in 3different masalas n tandoor-ed.. Bhindi anardana was a delight for bhindi lovers. It is a dry bhindi dish that goes well wuth rotis. The gramin special biryani is well cooked n just yummy. Chilli butter roti was different n you can definately try ut if u love spicy stuff! I would definately go back again just for their food.."

Waiting in the queue is always worth it because once you get a place to sit back, you can relax and have amazing veg food with the best collection of old hindi film songs. They soothe you and the appetite too. I always prefer the place when I am in mood of eating good vegetarian food."
3.5,I would have rated this place 4 a few months ago. . They have removed the paneer patanga which both me and my girlfriend used to love. .   its a nice place. . A bit cramped but value for money. . Do not take the rice items they are quite bland. .
4.5,Been there many times and never once was disappointed with the food.
5.0,The first restaurant I landed up after reaching Bangalore couple of years back. The place is value for money. Amazing taste. I would especially mention the Gramin A must visit for a sumptuous meal.
3.5,"Being a Bong, I wasn't really craving for veg food but being in a team where majority crave for veg food and their vouching that Gramin is the best place for Veg, we went to Gramin finally! It is always crowded as people know it's the best Veg restaurant around and I loved the ambiance and the decoration, the idea of climbing upstairs and their small, cute tables and chairs, their copper jugs and glasses. But, I didn't like sitting on the chair as it was too low :(   The jaljeera with lemon was really good. We ordered masala papad and this was also really nice. The paneer kabab and tikka, potato starters were also great and I thought that I was finally taking a liking towards veg food. I also loved the jeera rice and cashew and corn sabzi. I didn't like the kadhi, bhindi masala and dal makhani as it was too sour for my Bong taste buds. The lassi was good and the gulab jamun too.  The only reason I gave this 3.5 is that I loved their starters and even though I didn't like their main curries and I am not veggie enougn to judge them either, all my veg team mates liked them and rated Gramin as the best veg place ever!"
3.5,I went there with my fends last week.... the Malai tikka was cold... we called te waiter and had to get it replaced... but rest of the food is ok..... nothing awesome!!

Namely the Daal makhani tested like it was from another planet, not a 1% like the authentic Daal Makhani. I wonder how it got so many good reviews.                                                                 eatcapturetravel.wordpress.com"
1.0,"WORST VEG EXPERIENCE EVER went on a friends treat along with my parents who were visiting bangalore.  Ordered 1: corn soup: pathetic rice flavoured soup with few corns sprinkled. we couldn't finish half of it ,hoping that it might not be their speciality and that other items might be good. 2:spicy baby corn paneer: uncooked baby corn and paneer tossed in tonnes of spice and oil. Half cooked half fried dripping with oil and spicy like hell. we had it returned and ordered crispy baby corn to be on the safe side. what came as crispy was this chewy rubbery mushy baby corn deep fried probably more than once. By this time we knew we were in for a bad deal. 3: Ghee dal fry and Kadhai paneer: Now we didn't know how to go about the main course. Again to be on the safe side ,ordered the main course thinking that they probably cant screw on such simple dishes. Ghee dal fry tasted only of curry leaves n kadhai panner had uncooked vegetables. 4:Pineapple raita: A simple to prepare dish had rotten pineapple pieces and the curd kept bubbling for no reason. I had to literally embarrass the waiter cum manager to get it redone.  I wish i could give negative rating but that's not possible. And i still wonder why do people wait in long queues outside gramin for reservations!! :-S Quoting the waiters reply on returning back multiple dishes ""sir hum 10 saal se khana bana rahe hain, aapko hi pasand nahi aa raha, ab kya karein!!"""
4.5,"True to its name...this place has that typical desi ambience. Copper glasses nd plates and the seating arrangement as such . Food is simply awesome ! The thalis, pulav, sabjis just name them and they are good here. The desi beverages are so remarkable that one wud rethink goin to the pubs :D kidding :P But yeah i tried Panna and shikanji and it was scintillating. :)  The only prob here to get a seat. advance booking is highly recommended. Even after that there r less chances one will get der seat at the booked timing.   Service is ok. Sometimes one has to really remind the waiters for their orders. So visit wen u r not in any kind of hurry.   Esp for veggies, this place is a must visit . :) Try the tawa gobi fry...i LOuuved it :P"
4.0,"This place is easily 4 on 5. The place is quite simple and the focus is on tasty food and variety. You'll find a lot of new names on the menu and I'd suggest you to spend some time reading carefully before ordering. The flip side is, you'll have to wait for the table. It attracts quite a few people and its a testimony to the place."
4.5,"As the name says, Gramin tries to recreate the ambiance from a typical Indian village. It is a pure   vegetarian restaurant specializing in North Indian cuisine. Theres copper/bronze cutlery which weighs   about the same as your hand and this is in sync with the current trend, with the likes of Pind Baluchi,   Park Baluchi, Haveli and other north indian chains. The staff is courteous in general, although you might   have to wait, if the waiter assigned to you is attending some other table. The seating options range from   normal chairs to low seated wooden benches to wooden cots or the charpai. The place is well lit and the   service is efficient. A lot of options to choose from and the suggestions from the staff are quite good.   Theres a 12% discount on takeaways and all major cards are accepted.  Foodissection   Gramin hits a homerun here. The food is delicious. The presentation, the serving quantity and the aroma   get your mouth watering instantly. It takes about 10 minutes for the food to be served, but its a feast   from then on! A special mention to the quality of the Indian breads served. They are well cooked not the   usual rubbery texture and not over cooked. One dish is sufficient for a single person. The textures and   the tastes from the authentic dishes are something to die for !!!  All dishes range from 75-100. We ordered Dal Makhni and Paneer Kadhai. Both the dishes were simply   fantastic and left us wanting for more. The bread selection has a nice variety, but is seriously overpriced.   Plain naan will cost about 40 Rs while a simple tandoori roti is for 17 Rs. A better option would be to   order a bread basket which is for 100 bucks and contains about 4 different types of bread from   kulchas, paranthas and naan, which individually cost around 40 each.  No alcoholic drinks are served but many types of local mixes are available. We found them to be a bit on   the expensive side (40-50 Rs for a glass of Lassi).  Shining stars- this has to be the  Lunch Thali for Rs 80 ! sufficient for one person, it has 2 rotis, 2 types of   dishes , dal, papad and rice. Simple and delicious J  Tip- Be prepared for around 15 mins waiting time, on a weekend. But the wait is worth it !!!"
4.5,"Third visit for me here, decent food and prompt service as always. The place always has a waiting que no matter when u go. Reasonable Pricing and quick service is what makes the place stand out. I would have given the place a 5 however, their dal makhani was the worst ever-boiled pulses serves with a dash of butter. Good option if your going in a group !"
4.5,Typical Gramin setup! Amazing food. Try the Okra ( lady Finger) Fry. The food here was very good and of great quality. We were seven who went here for lunch and enjoyed it thoroughly. Lassi here is simply one of the closest to the actual that I have had in south India. its good for quick team lunch (1.5 hrs) to relaxed meetings. Try it to enjoy it!
3.5,"One of the decent Veg restaurants around. Ordered one paneer starter, which was very good, bhindi fry and stufffed aloo, which were okay. Stuffed aloo felt bit spicy. Panna, lassi and nimbu ki shikanji were three drinks that we ordered and all were very good. I could not keep down the nimbu drink till I fully finished it.  For main course we took muglai palak paneer, veg handi along with parathas and stuffed kulcha. Stuffed kulcha was very filling. Parathas were good. Liked veg handi more than paneer one.  Best part was the gulab jamoon. They were very soft and tasty. One of the best I have had in recent times. (Dessert section is not indicated in the menu since they serve only gulab jamoon) Overall, food served was tasty although few things felt bit spicy. There was a long waiting queue outside the restaurant when we came out finishing our dinner. Reserving a table does help a lot.  Coming to the ambiance, they have tried to give it a rustic feel but all that matters are spacious tables, good chairs and decent cutlery, which are available here. However, the fan noise combined with voices around can be a bit overwhelming especially when waiting for food. Waiters were courteous, although they were not as cheerful and appeared sad for some reason."
1.5,we were a group of 13 members. service was prompt and quick. but food was not tasty. soup and starters was really sad.
4.5,"I absolutely love this place!  Brilliant decor, nice service, amazing value for money for the food you get!  I have been there twice in 2 weeks. Both the times I started dinner with 'aam panna'.  Amazing refreshing treat after a tiring day. I have tried panner butter masala, veg paneer korma, dal makhni, paneer kukure there and none of them disappointed me  (I can speak only for Vegetarians).   Service is pretty prompt, this small cute place impresses you instantly with the decor/ambience. This place is almost full all the time(once I went at 0700pm and second time at 10pm).   Perfect place to have a nice meal in budget."
3.0,"Ignore my rating as I wasn't actually craving for Veg food. I was accompanying my boss (super Veggie) and my colleague (Fish is veg-Bong).  First things first, You expect a grameen (village like) ambience they would have succeeded the effort by 60%. The place is slightly cramped but thankfully I was too hungry to care.  The service : They were very courteous,with a smile on face. Dressed up like Air India mascot - minus the turban, they seemed warm - Genuinely!!  The food: Im a person who hate when the masala smell has to over power the flavour of the food. (Some north Indian restaurant make sure that one think they have masala supplied at subsidised rates and forget to keep it... what do i call it?? .. Umm.. Tasteful??) Gramin does exactly that with the Thali .. The best buy.. a full spread of two roti,1 subji,daal,Gravy,Rice,Raitha and Sweet at 91/- .. Smart Buy!! The food is nutricious u feel, No maida in the Roti (Im too specific) flavours perfectly balanced in Daal and Soft Jamun  were the highlights. So if you have a friend who is a veggie and you need to zero in on a place in Koramangala this  s a good choice, Tasted and approved by a Carnivorous. :)"
3.5,"Just a stone throw away from Forum Mall in Koramangala is Prestige Arcade, the restaurant is in the ground floor, though the restaurant itself is quite small they have tables and chairs put up in the Mall lobby.  The place serves very nice Vegetarian fare I like it much better than most of the restaurant serving only Veg.   Though getting Served can be a little challenging during peak hours/days, I usually prefer this place during Tuesdays as its Vegetarian for me on that day :)"
3.5,"The oldest of hindi songs, affordable food menu, traditional ambiance with a bit of waiting for your table makes ""Gramin"" a sneakpeak lunch/dinner place for everyone who pass by Koramangala.  A huge variety to choose from. Starters are good in taste and quantity. Been here lot of times with colleagues and a frnd. Veg Sheek kabab is a must try for a starter. And as usual i end it up with my fav Masala chaas ;) - Wont regret making this a habit.  Main course on the other hand is quite tasty. You get the best of Spicy daal tadka and sabjis here. The service is good and fast. The seatings are good too. Yet again, my frnd loves this place the most for the classic old hindi songs.   A must visit!   Ambiance - 3.5/5 Staff - 3.5/5 Service - 3.5/5 Food 3.5/5  Overall experience 3.5/5"
4.0,Lovely food awesome!!!!!!  North indian food in south india ....Thumbs up
3.5,To begin with this place is really popular so please make sure you have reservations. We had to wait for a while to get a table and were asked to order as we waited.  The stuffed tandoori aloo and chatka gobi were really nice. The Rajasthani bhindi tasted a little bitter because it was over fried.  For main course we tried two of their dals. The makhni dal is really nice and the serving is a generous one. The breads are quiet nice and the bread basket has a good assortment.  The pudhina khatta meetha is a must try drink. Immensely refreshing. The American corn and palak preparation wasn't very great but the veg salan was really nice and so was the handi paneer. Very out of the box dishes at Gramin. Just the right amount of spice and oil.  Must try at least once.
3.5,"Decent food, average service.   One of the first things that you should do first is to get in the line. However, if the wait is too long, you can come another time. It isn't 'that' good.  We ordered paneer Kolhapuri and matar baingan bharta.   Paneer Kolhapuri was not Kolhapuri. The tomato gravy was too sour. Matar baingan bharta was good. Gulkand milk shake was good, though a bit expensive. The bread basket has 4 varieties, which were ok. The portions are good.   I had also asked for dal Afghani. With no details in the menu, I based it on Afghani dal that I used to eat in Saudi at the afghan shops. That is a mixture of 5 dals, cooked overnight. I fortunately asked and was told that its black dal. I think the Afghan village they went to get the receipt was under Taliban and they had banned all other dals ;). They had another dal like that. But, then I let it go.   The service was responsive once you manage to get the waiter's eye, which takes quite some time. Waiter has probably been asked to no check on the tables on his own.   The fans are few and far between. The mosquito were many and close by.   I would prefer take-away next time."
4.0,"I have been to this place only once and I am super - impressed with it ! The best i have able to locate so close to Forum mall.  Ambiance - I loved the ambiance. The moment you enter this place you are transformed into a village set-up. From the furniture, the dishes , the mats , the walls or the ceilings everything is inspired from village culture. Taste - The best North-Indian dishes I have ever tasted. Yummy food ! ( No wonder the place is crowded all the time ! ) Service - Decent efficient staff. Price - Moderate."
4.0,"I loved this place it is very nice with a good seating and though this place looks small it has lot of space but we had to wait for a long time in the queue to get the place but apart from that no complains.  Its just so nice to be with a big gang and this place has good food, with great aroma and amazing taste.  We had ordered a lot of food rotis raitas desserts daal and everything was just yum and of good quantity.  I will surely visit this place again"
3.5,"Good, but not great. You will get decent veg food at decent price. Tawa karela is one of the best dish they make."
1.0,Worst veg food i had in bangalore.I went with my family to have lunch at this place.We ordered naan and veg curry(i don't remember as it has been a long time).The curry was cold and taste less.I couldn't complete a whole naan as it couldn't eat much further.Ambience is average but overall experience-1/5
2.5,"I used to like this place a lot a few years back. It is one of the few pure vegetarian north Indian restaurants in Bangalore, conveniently located and moderately priced. They have a pretty long menu with a lot of interesting choices. The staff is prompt and courteous too. However, you always have to wait for a very long time to get a table - thanks to its location and small size. With time, their food quality has seriously gone down. Everything seems to taste the same and is very bland. I don't think it is woth waiting for so long for the food. I am not sure if they do home delivery. You may consider ordering from them if your cook doesn't show up and no one wants to cook at home. They flaunt a lot of awards / recognition they have received over the years, but frankly, you should check the dates on the certificates before taking them too seriosuly."
4.0,"Great north-Indian food at very reasonable prices.  This place is styled a eatery in rural Rajasthan/Punjab and have succeeded at that. The space in the restaurant is a bit congested. Lack of air-conditioning also made it a bit suffocating inside.  We started with soups - tomato and corn. The tomato one was decent- not bad, not anything extra-ordinary, while the corn soup was pretty bad. Moving on the to the main course, each gravy was really good and there weren't any complains with any of them. We had baingan ka bharta, chana masala, kadai paneer and dal fry and each of them was delicious. The breads were equally good. I had a phirki paratha, basically a lachha paratha made with atta mixed with red chilli and other spices - different and tasty.   Apart from the great food, one this which stood out was the service. From our entry to the place till the billing, they served us the way one would expect in a restaurant 4 times as much. And all this given that the restaurant was runnign at full capacity and there was barely any space for them to move around. The speed and efficiency with which they served was really commendable.   This place gives brilliant value for money too. You can have a lip-smacking meal at less than 250/head (including a drink).  Must try for those who are disappointed with otherwise dismal options for north-indian food in Banglore (atleast in this price range). The fact that its fully vegetarian is another plus!  UPDATE - Recently tried the MIrch ka Saalan and it was quite a delight. Not many restaurants dare to keep on their menu. If you are bored of the same kadai-paneer+mix-veg+dal routine, do give it try."
3.0,Gramin is located opp. Forum Mall in Koramangala and place is usually crowded. The sitting space is spread across 2 levels and there is ample waiting place outside the restaurant. You can order your food while you wait for your table. The waiting call get long during lunch hours on a weekdays with the office crowd.   Lot of people prefer the Thali which is quick and convenient.   The menu has a long list of items without any explanation. There are regulars at this place who I think have tasted most of the items on the menu and know what to quickly pick and choose.  The food is ok and some of items are really on the spicier side.  If you are in a mood for some spicy north Indian vegetarian food and willing to spend time waiting for a table this is the place.
3.5,"A very simple restaurant that serves very tasty veg food  Ambiance is not the priority but service is . Very nice service and overall we left very satisfied , though sometimes the waiting for this place can be a killer   had a walk around the back and saw a glimpse of the kitchen which was forgettable ;)"
5.0,The best restaurant for North Indian and Gujarati dishes. I never miss an opportunity to dine at Gramin! They certainly have the best selection of Jain dishes! Highly highly recommended!
4.0,Its probabaly the place wr i wuld love to lunch out every single day except weekedns!:)  Happen to go here forcefully with a friend of mine then turned it a other way round! Do make a visit on weekedays (preferably) for luch to give an awesoe tangy taste to ya tast buds!  Thali they serve here is just too much to eat but not worth wasting as well;) Food is just perfect at its taste and served to fill u completely!  so place to hopin tomo for lunch!..:)
4.5,"Good, really good restaurant, for North Indian food lovers. I have been to this place, as many times as to my Granny's place.  Last Saturday 13th April, I visited this place for dinner. It's diagonally opposite to Forum mall in Koramangala, which is easy to locate. First things first, evenings, on weekends, you HAVE to visit this place before 8 pm and grab a table, otherwise, you have to wait for 20 to 30 min easily. Keeping this in mind, I went there by 7.50 pm and occupied a table for 6.   I ordered the following dishes,  Banjara Paneer Tikka,  Aloo Fries (these are better than the ones you get in Mc'D, deeply fried) Basket of Rotis (4 different types of Rotis) 2 Butter Naans Gramin Biryani Peas Pulao Sabz Do Pyaza Gobi Masala  All .... All of them deserve 5 / 5. Great taste. And coming to beverages,Nimbu Ka Shikanj, Sweet Lassi, and Masala soda are equally good. I personally like Masala Soda, because it has soda and Jeera which helps in digestion.  Finally, the bill for all these items, turned out to be only Rs. 1205, which I feel is quite economical. Great Gramin team, keep it up. !!!!! Good going."
2.0,"Gramin is so quaint from the outside...it makes you want to give it a shot... add to that, a great choice in menu...pure veg food and killer prices...seems like you're set...but don't be fooled! we ordered the gobbi tikka...and immediately got diarrhoea...i kid you not... there were two foreigners next to us nd they kept rushing up to the restroom cuz the food upset their stomach... the glasses are dirty...the waiters are unhygenic....all the tables kept retyrning their food too... it was a disaster of an experience followed by a long amount of bed rest from food poisoning...Not recommended!"
4.5,Awesome food with nice ambience at affordable price this place is too good I recommend to try at least once we tried thali it was good food was tasty specially chach was awesome and all this at less than 100 per person its superb
3.0,"Well, I have been to this place many times and have always been pleased with the food here. But yesterday was not one of those day's. We ordered gobi chatpata, masala papad, palak paneer, rotis and kulchas  and aam panna and buttermilk for drinks. Gobi chatpata was bad and this was what the waiter recommended when I had asked for some spicy starter. Aam panna was also not that great. The remaining was good enough. The person who waited on us was rude too. I know this place is very reasonable and serves tasty food but yesterday was definitely not my day or theirs."
4.5,"I first discoverd this place when I was meeting a friend at forum and we decided not to eat at forum . So we came at raheja arcade on search of a restaurant and what a good decision it was .   Ambiance : authentic Indian with paintings all around they have a seating space at mezzanine floor too which I love . I always ask for a seating on mezzanine floor . Beware of the timings , this place gets crowded on peak timings and then you will have to roam around in raheja arcade .   Menu : I love their pure vegetarian menu , so many things to choose from :) , and they have marked a chilli sign in front of some items where they say it will be spicy , two chillies means double spicy . They have a lot of options got Jain veg also . Just in case .   Food : I would like to specially mention about the crispy bhindi , it's lovely . I never has bhindi in this form and it tastes delicious . The drinks , jal jeera and aam panna are good . Otherwise also food is delicious . The starters here are amazing . There is a lack of dessert option in this place , but I feel there are too many dessert optionns around so u  can check them out .   Value for money : oh yes , this is a perfect place ro eat north Indian veg food without digging a hole in your pocket .   I recommend :)"
5.0,"Awesome food at an awesome cost. Jabardast! To top it up, do have Shikanji to compliment the food."
2.0,"Have been to this place twice and has finally decided never again. I don't understand why people have rated it so high and as one of the best vegetarian restaurant. In my opinion they suck, Lets talk one by one : 1. Food and taste : I have tried their bhindi masala (total disaster) Daal ( both makhani and double tadka) no taste at all. 2. Cleanliness : They have a village theme, they use brass glasses and steel plates, for giving a natural look all the glasses have dents and all, till this I have no problem but can you please at least clean them properly and about the waiters can you please give them clean dresses to wear?? 3. Price : Price wise they are okay, but again the crap food they give I felt cheated. 4. Ambiance : Okay  Not recommended."
4.5,Amazing place and especially so as they also serve jain food. The taste is also amazing- It a skill to cook Veg food and espacially jain veg food. Waiting is killing but once you are seated then its done. Great place to visit again n again. Tawa bhindi is really good and even paneer main course dishes are great.  Request the management to branch out in East Bangalore too as the place has a big market for good Jain food.  I have cut the .5 points for the scale and waiting. Well as general rule i would suggest all dinners not to try any gobhi/cauliflower dish in any restaurants in Bangalore because those who cook shall know the quality of gobhi that comes in bangl market.   Highly recommended.
4.0,"I used to go often here, whenever I feel like eating Vegetarian. It also located in the main place near forum, but very difficult to get a seat, better to go before 12:30 atleast 12:45PM, otherwise after 1 it is very crowded and will have to wait for more than 10 mins. I used to order rotis bucket, so that we can taste all varieties of rotis. I like Lachha paratha among the rotis i had here.  Jaljeera the best I have had in recent times.  Overall food was good and it was one of the best north indian veg restaurant in Koramangala.  Ambience - 3/5 Food - 4/5 Quality - 5/5 Service - 4/5 Value - 5/5"
4.0,"Nice place to have good Punjabi food that too at economical price. Quality and quantity of food is good. Waiting time is more during weekends which sometimes leads to average service.  Overall a good experience. Must try - Kadai Paneer, Dal Makhani & Lassi."
4.5,"Excellent food, amazing service and the real 'gramin' ambiance. Never have been disappointed with this place. Almost all the items on their menu are delectable, no wonder it's always packed with people. Perfect place if you're looking for good food which is not heavy on your pocket."
2.5,"I have visited this place twice. Only if I would've visited it once, my impression about this place would be better.   The first time was pretty good. We ordered tawa peas corn for starters. That is until now the only good thing I've had at Gramin. Aloo paratha and dal makhani for main course was not bad at all. Did not really have a complain against the service.  The second visit was a disaster! We went there as a bigger group and I guess they just couldn't handle that. Bhindi rajasthani was completely burnt and black! Tasted like some greasy paper! Second starter was babycorn paneer chatpatta! Bad choice I would say! Firstly, weird combination and the color of the dish was literally like s**t. One of weirdest things I've had. Finally we settled for the same thing we had last time, tawa corn peas. phew! For mains, kaju masala was surprisingly eatable and the usual paneer butter masala was just mediocre.  And the service was the last thing I want to talk about. The waiter was completely disinterested, like he was forced to wait for us. The water glass had something in it the first time I asked for it, had to get it changed.  I would give them a few points for the ambience. Good attempt to give it kinda 'gramin' look.  One thing, better than some of the north indian places in Bangalore, is Lassi!"
3.5,"Detailing towards the decor to the food they serve are all in place.   Vegetarian food usually does not appeal to me as much since most often you will end up hovering your eyes around a paneer dish in either a green or a red masala,   But, this place has a variety to chose from. I let the paneer be and went for a more unusual 'Dum aloo'  and 'baingan Bharta' (an eggplant preparation). Taste was right up there.   The place is clean, good prompt service. The food and drinks served in brass metal plates and glasses make up for a stand out USP.   Don't be fooled by the images by the name of a dish indicating its peculiar taste (Spicy, sweet etc). Nothing is a as spicy as it has been put out there to be.   Again being a minute's walk form office I am definitely going here when I am sick of all the non vegetarian food. Rarest occasions. But still works."
3.5,"If you are a vegetarian looking for some delicious North Indian food, Gramin is the place to go! Been here quite a few times and the food has never disappointed me. It's a small place but the food here is worth every penny!  The ambiance is very elegant however this place is always crowded hence you hardly get to enjoy the surroundings. The food here is cheap and a good place to treat a large group of people!  The naan, veg kadai, veg kolhapuri and the various paneer dishes are a treat to your taste buds. Also if you are a sucker for spicy food, you will find a lot of yummy spicy curries here. On the other hand i didn't like the tomato soup much. It's the only soup i have tried out here and i didn't like it at all. Quick and prompt service along with such good food will definitely make you come back for more. :)                                                                 foodierambling.blogspot.com"
4.0,"The only veg restaraunt I would go by choice. That's saying a lot, because I avoid veg food, like the plague. You have to wait for a table on all days which  means the food is good. The service is also good, maybe because im a regular here. The interiors are set like an Indian village and food is served in copper dishes. The Thali is definitely VFM and makes sense if you are dining alone. My favorite is the Garlic kulcha with malai kofta. The Aam panna is simply the best I ever had."
4.0,"Gramin is best described as value for money. The location is bang in the middle of Koamangala next to Forum. It has a nice rustic earthy decor, and the only complaint is it's a bit cramped. We squeezed ourselves in anyhow, and ordered for a delicious round of Spicy Masala Buttermilk, which, true to it's name, was spicy and masaledar, but yummy as well. For the maincourse we ordered Mughlai Palak Kofta and Navratna Korma, both of which were excellent, along with Lachha and Pudina Paranthas, which were great as well. The proverbial icing on the cake, though, was at the end when you see the bill and realise you don't see such prices in most restaurants anymore! A must try for north Indian food lovers!"
4.5,"This one deserves more than 4.  It's a very good veg restaurant that serves not just good food but also on very genuine prices. They are really economical with their prices.  It's just near the forum in the Raheja Arcade, they have a very traditional Indian interior with ample sitting place. The staff is very helpful and prompt. On weekends its usually full so expect a bit of delay in your order.   They serve mainly the North Indian food, that is both rich and mild on spices. The waiter helps you understand the types of curry that comes with those confusing names.  The quality of food is good and quantity served is well above as per the prices charged. A meal for two comes under Rs. 250.  One thing they miss is variety of sweet dish. They should offer more in this regard.  Tip : Try the paneer dishes - curry is rich.  Gulkand Shake - They have loads of rose petals blended with sweet milk - something unique.   All in all a place worth going again and again for north India veg food cravings."
4.0,"Gramin was one of the place which offers more value for money. I was surprised to see the number of people waiting outside for their turn. I had a decent dinner there. Everything tasted great. It is a little too congested though. But, overall I would recommend everyone to relish the taste of Gramin at least once."
3.5,"Been there with friends for lunch, ambiance is ok, food is nice, only one thing that you will have to wait so long for ur turn."
4.0,Best Veg restraunt at very affordable price in a location like Koramangala.
1.0,Staff is highly uncourteous. We were rudely told to vacate a table. Clearly they care about numbers and not quality. Customer satisfaction is not a priority at all.
4.0,"A friend and me were looking for a particular restaurant, when we chanced upon Gramin. We asked a paan-wallah for directions for that restaurant, which he gave, but at the same time suggested that we try Gramin that's quite close by. We reached Gramin and decided to give it a try because we liked the look of it. Very nicely designed, with rural India as inspiration, they serve in copper cutlery - which I totally loved! We had the Chatpata Gobi for starters, which was so spicy and completely out of the world! We also had the delicious Tawa Pulao and Veg Kadai that had a very yummy gravy (not one of those orange-y ones that you get). We finished it off with Masala Chaas which was like the icing on the cake. A very good and reasonably priced restaurant. Definitely one of my favourites!"
3.0,"I visited this place  couple of days back and found it quite good.The only con i found in this restaurant  was that it was not so spacious.Since it was a weekend we had  reserved a table for ourselves in advance to avoid any suffering.But the waiters over there,pestered us by telling that we should hurry up as many  people were waiting outside.This part was quite annoying.  Otherwise the quality of food was pretty good.They have a wide variety in starters.  So 4 anybody going there on the weekend ,my suggestion wud be book a table 4 urself in advance to avoid any mess.So in short Grahmin is good 4 visiting once :)"
4.0,service - 4/5 Food - 4/5 Ambiance -3.5/5 Pricing- Excellent  try out - Thali with shikanji  All over - a good experience...  ## reasonable and best place for vegetarians
4.0,"Gramin will go down in archives as the first veg restaurant to written about on my blog. In fact, the first visit had happened because of my conniving better half. Given my non-veg credentials, it's understandable that I might not want to publicise my multiple visits.  Gramin gets quite crowded after about 7.45, so unless you want to wait, its best to get there before that. It has two floors - ground and mezzanine, and the decor matches the 'gramin' theme of the place. Compact seating arrangements, I prefer the mezz floor. We started with a Banjara Paneer Tikka. There were only two soup options, but that was compensated by lots of starter options. The tikka was not too spicy and came with an amazing chutney. We also had a masala butter milk and a sweet lassi. I had wanted a kala khatta but they had run out of it. The lassi was very sweet and thick, thoroughly enjoyable. The buttermilk was quite spicy, but if spice is what you want, then I'd recommend the Hari mirch soda, its quite awesome. The starter had about 6 pieces and so we only ordered a single dish for the main course. That was the paneer onion chatka and it was a reasonably good choice, though I liked the bhurji we've had earlier, better. To go with that, we ordered a butter methi roti, and a stuffed kulcha. The kulcha was a bit burnt, but the methi roti was quite good, with quite a large quantity of butter. And thus ended the sabzi outing at a price that will make you raise your eyebrows in surprise - a pleasant one, that is. Gramin is a must try for all veggie Bangaloreans, they serve some excellent food. Its okay for the non veggies to give in once in a while too, we'll agree not to judge each other. ;)   ----- 09 Feb, 2011 -----  Gramin will go down in archives as the first veg restaurant to written about on this blog. Before going further, let me reassure readers that I'm too chicken to go veg, this is just an aberration caused by super villainess D, who, with a malicious smile, ignored her bitter half ,  and chose the weekend's dining spot.  Gramin is located in Raheja Arcade. This is on the road that goes from Forum to National Games Village. When coming from the MG Road direction, it'd be best to take a left after the Tata Indicom office, and then, at the very end get on the road leading towards Forum. Raheja Arcade will then fall on the left, just before the Forum junction, and you can find parking on the service lane right after the building.

1.0,"Went to Gramin with couple of my friends , The staff there is uncourteous . The sitting is not at all comfortable on a sat eve they didn't have most of the starters on the menu. Service it so pathetic that they got one of our starters just before the desserts.   Although there is a huge range of dishes but most of the gravies taste very similar.  The only highlight about the place is its location and a claim to be serving authentic indian cuisine which its not.  If you are around forum and cant think of a place to eat out and wanna spoil your rest of the day the you should definitely go to Gramin."
1.0,"I shoudn't be wasting too much time n precious energy to review this overrated place. Let me keep it real short. Bad seats, bad service and avg food.  Believe me there are many better places if you want only veg food."
3.0,"Nice food, specially the baby corn starter. The bad part is the place is cramped up and also the waiters are clumpsy. They spilled water a couple of times but again its the place you can if looking for a quick lunch in middle of a working day in office.  It is a worth giving try."
4.0,"I had heard nothing about rave reviews about this place from everyone who's been here, somehow it took me quite a while to land up at this place. But once I did, I can say I'm very impressed.  Ambiance - Just loved the simple decor and superb choice of music playing in the background. Just a warning, watch out for the low ceiling. Else for a budget place its done very well. Neat and clean!  Food - For 77 bucks for a North Indian thali, this place is a STEAL!! Ala carte is very good too, the dishes have influences from all over India. I tried their Paneer Vindaloo and Dal Makhni, while its not the best in Bangalore it certainly is better than most other places out there. At this price I don't think I have much to complain either, its well prepared, tastes are all right, what more can one ask for! :-)  Service - Good, quick and efficient  Value for Money - Oh! Definitely YES!  Good taste + Decent ambiance + Quick service + Value for money, all these factors combined make this is a must go place if you are in the vicinity and want to grab a quick north indian meal."
1.0,"Bad Bad Bad..... Pathetic Quality and taste...  It was a horrible experience to stand and wait for an exact 1 hour at dinner time from 7:30 pm to 8:30 pm just waiting outside in the courtyard of Raheja Arcade.  They simply need to do something about this....  They got crowd but this crowd is just hungry for cheap food (not tasty food)  All come to eat North Indian. But I can ensure you this restaurant needs to really visit the Northern belt and start their basics again.  We went in a group of 14 people and ordered some Nans, Rotis, Missi Rotis with Dal Makhani, Shahi Paneer and Mix Veg and Peas Pulao... Simple order so that it could be prepared easily and could be served fast...  It goes like this...  Breads were under heated and we could taste the flour which was uncooked. We asked them to cook properly and the management told that this is the best they could do so we managed with it somehow but eating tits and bits of it.  Dal Makhani was so dry and it looked more of a SABZI than a Dal ... looked as if taken out from Deep Freezer and reheated. Not a person could feel it was Dal. We took scoops of it like Vanilla Ice Cream..  Paneer was like a lost soul in the Shahi Paneer dish, each plate had only 3 pieces of it and it were just a little bigger than .5 inch. (i would say close to .6 inch) in size... Sadly we looked upon Mix Veg to find an alternative solution to the pathetic choice and what we found was that only the Bowl was heated and not the Sabzi.. it was cool below room temp. surely this one came out of the refrigerator.  next came the Peas Pulao ... this was a winner amongst all.....  Lastly came Lassi and Chaach... i am sure everyone knows what a Chaach is ...at least a restaurant manager...  What we get is Jal Jeera instead of Chaach and he is trying to convince this is Chaach..  it was a funny moment...  we asked for the bill and clicked a picture to remember this lousy choice we made....  No way i am gonna risk my life again in the hands of this Restaurant...... Take you chance....."
4.0,"The Food is great,all the paneer dishes are a must try. Its great food at decent cost!!"
2.0,"Very authentic rajasthani cuisine, the flavours of amchur shine through the crispy bhindi and the rotis are yummy.The lassi comes in a huge tumbler very difficult for one person to take down. usually very crowded on weekends. drool-eat-blog.blogspot.com                                                                 drool-eat-blog.blogspot.com"
4.0,Really like the food and the hospitality.. proper north indian food and very reasonable prices!! Awesome place!!
3.5,"Gramin-located in the heart of Raheja Arcade, Koramangala, is a theme restaurant.they serve robust North Indian veg food.  try to avoid this place on weekends as its always crowded.one has to wait outside in a queue and place the order in advance.food is served immediately once seats are available so in a way service is brisk! so overall ambience is'nt good, though the decor is done pretty well.  the decor gives the place a rustic look with low seating , Rajasthani dolls and Gujarati handworks on display and old hindi songs played all along.it has 2 floors,the mezzanine floor is more aesthetic compared to the ground floor.  the food here is done well.they have a nice widespread menu of vegetarian food.they claim that they don't use any additive food color and preservative which means the food is fresh. i have tried their aloo paratha,butter milk,paneer kolhapuri,dal makhani,bhindi rajasthani,lassi,kadai paneer, harabhara kabab. personaly i like the harabhara kabab, bhindi rajasthani and lassi here. the food is well priced though i feel the beverages are bit high priced but overall this place doesn't lighten your wallet so its a value for money. my ratings : food- 4/5, ambience-3/5, service- 4/5, value for money- 4/5. i recommend this place to pure vegetarians who are looking for North Indian food."
4.0,"Good ambience, great food and ok service. The karela starters and harabhara kebab was fantastic. Prices very reasonable. My family enjoyed it thoroughly. Arvind"
3.0,"We always wanted to go here. But we had owed our allegiance to Om the first time we had to pick between Om and Gramin. That time we chose Om over Gramin, because there was a long queue outside Gramin.  After going to Om 3-4 times after that day, we decided to try Gramin. That day it was relatively empty. We found the food ok but not fantastic. But dont get me wrong, it is definately great food that you can have over and over again. But it doesnt top the food we had the first time at Om (next door).  So I will give a slightly lesser rating. Another reason for the lesser rating was the behaviour of the waiter staff. They were hard to get your attention and looked totally disinterested in waiting the tables - something thats a big turn-off for me."
3.0,"All veg restaurant served modestly  There are some restaurants which do well and they go on for ages. Every city has few of these. And mind it, these set of restaurants never go into chains or become biggies. Gramin is one of them. A perfect fit to this list.  I have been to this place on numerous occasions. It is near Forum Mall and inside Raheja Arcade.  I love the Bhindi Rajasthani and the Lasooni paratha as a standard part of our order always. Daal Afghani are a must here. Panner items are soft and feels fresh.  Service is a bit laid back though. And the waiters go about ding their business without a fuss. Don't expect loads of attention from them.  It is a comfy neighbourhood restaurant in a prime location. Cost is moderate. However, there is always a wait for tables during every peak hour, every day."
4.0,"Gramin...Dont Let the name fool you...It might mean Village but Boy that's the best North Indian food I could find in Bangalore...The place is clean, service good and the food is simply delicious... A friend took me there first time and I was a little hesitant...but once I had the food I just kept goin back... They serve you in the village style glasses and plates but with a proper seating...A perfect presentation of a village of a city person like me... Paneer Tikka Masala and Daal Afghani are a must try for everyone...The place is appropriately priced though I felt the drinks were a little over priced... The quantity is huge...So if you are a light eater I would recommend a single dish...if you are not then SKY is the limit and you get to try a lot.... The service is damn good except sat and Sun when its jam packed...Then also they wont take longer than 15 mins to bring your food...They have a pretty efficient system on Sat and Sun...U get your name booked and after that you decide wat you want to have and tell them...by the time you get a table your food will be there in 15 mins..any subsequent order doesnt take longer than 10 mins... rotis in abt 5...Cost for two wont go above 400 I can guarantee that..  I would say for a nice place like this: Food 5/5 Ambiance 3.5/5  Service 4/5 Value for Money 3.5/5 Overall 4/5  Recommendation: Add Non Veg also please.... :-)"
3.0,Not that good. Didn't find the place clean. Uncomfortable seats.
4.0,"Vegetarians finally have a place to scamper to when it's their turn to pick the restaurant. What an absolute delight. I'd been to Gramin quite a while before but the circumstances did not permit me to fully enjoy the food then, nothing wrong with the restaurant, I just wasn't there with great company. Yesterday I decided to go to the place with my girlfriend and get reacquainted with the wonderful experience that is Gramin.   Gramin is in Raheja Arcade. Parking was a slight problem and I spent a little while trying to find a spot. After that we walked down to the restaurant and we were immediately seated in the top section. The decor is minimalist and it's done up to reflect a rural setting as is suggestive of the name. Everything from the tables down to the glasses is authentic. For a vegetarian place the menu is quite varied and we ordered Tawa Gobi, 3 Butter Naans, Boondi Raita and Paneer Ka Saalan. The service was very quick and we got the appetizer in no time. Having subsisted on all iterations of Gobi Manchuria, I was delighted when I tried the Tawa Gobi. It was served with Pudina Chutney and it was perfect. The butter naans, raita and paneer ka saalan came shortly after and the flavors were subtle and mellow, and went down extremely well. The entire meal cost us Rs. 325 and we couldn't finish the food entirely. I'll definitely be back there soon. If you love vegetarian food and you want a decently priced meal, you should head to Gramin. You won't regret it."
5.0,Food here is excellent in taste and cheap at price. One of my favourites. Visit this place once and you would visit again and again.
4.0,"One of the best places ive ever been to. the food severed here is preety good. this was d 1st resto i visited in banaglore.   They have a huge variety of starters. starting from papad to kabaabs(veg). this place is as good as heaven for a economical class vegeterian who cant afford spending 1000 bucks on a lunch o dinner for 2. but that doesnt mean its cheap.. the prices are low but that has nothing to do with the quality.  if you wanna try something in starters, id suggest you to have chatka gobhi.. they serve it with ""mint chatni"" which is fresh and spicy..  The place underwent a renovation during the month of april-may. after that it smelled paint for 15 days. now its perfect.   has around 35 member seating arrangement. always crowded. thats what happens if you run a nice restaurent in koramangala at a decent price. If you plan to go on a weekend make sure you reach there by 7:30  pm so that you get a table by 8-8:30 pm.. you can order your choice while you are waiting and once you are in, you'll be served in less than 10 mins..  Majority of people over here is north indian.. the food is awesome.. they dont use any artificail color of preservative while cooking. the food is fresh and tasty.   If you are a LASSI-LOVER, you are at the right place. i bet you will not find better LASSI in town. they also have butter milk and jal-jeera.. but lassi is my personal favourite..  Best place to be when you wanna have REAL-FOOD.."
3.0,"typical north indian food ......plzz dnt go on weeknds it wl tk sum 1hr for ur turn 2 cum.....good in taste,not to xpensive , bt ambience is bit low"
5.0,"An out-and-out vegetarian restaurant with a rustic ambience, Gramin serves robust North Indian food. Popular in the area, except a long wait before you get into the restaurant."
5.0,The best north Indian restaurant I have come across in Bangalore so far . The food was very spicy but good. Service and ambience is also good . Overall a perfect option for a perfect north Indian dinner . Great variety of paneer delicacies .
3.0,"very tasty North Indian food. it has a North Indian village kind of ambience. Lots of dolls hanging around. few Tables are  real low, it gives that tradinal look. But the place is kind of congested.  I loved lassi and Paneer curry."
2.0,"I expected a lot more because I saw a crowd waiting to get in. It's an average place overall. There are quite a few out there who will recommend this place stressing on the fact that even the meat lovers will love it here, it surely didn't make sense after the meal. The very fact that the portions in the 'Thali' seemed like they are appetizers made us realize we expected a lot more out of here. Maybe they had good days and that is the reason it is so crowded but I'm not too sure that it is worth multiple visits.  However there are few good points. The drinks being them and the variety of Dals but that is all. Nothing out of ordinary."
1.0,"worst food i have ever eaten. i feel you might be food poisoned if you eat their masala papad, though i have complained no response was taken. request not to take your children as their immunity would be down"
3.0,Amazing place had a nice meal here the meals are very cost efficient. They have a good feel to the place like a north Indian village and that compliments the type of food the serve this place is a must visit for all veggies :)
3.0,"I'm not big on vegetarian restaurants, simply because I think when I can have meat why have vegetables. But I have a couple of vegetarian friends who insisted we go to gramin. I've been to Gramin before and have actually liked it. Somehow I didn't miss meat there. The food is completely north Indian and very nice. Tangy, spicy and delicious is how I'd describe gramin food. The rajasthani bhindi, chatka gobhi, balti paneer and the lassi are a few of our favorite orders. Also ask for the desserts because their gulab jamun is brilliant. Quite reasonably priced since 3 of us usually spend about 700 rs approx. I would definitely recommend gramin to all vegetarians who are missing typical north Indian food."
4.0,Gramin is a vegeterian's delight! This place has been boasting about their food for years now and guess what.. Its absolutely true! I have been here a couple of times and have returned happy :) Located at the Raheja Arcade in the busiest part of Kormangala you just cannot miss it. The 'Gramin' decor just adds to it. Gramin btw means 'Rural/Village' (in the nicest possible way!) The way they have utilized the space is worth appreciating. The seating is comfortable too ofcourse with a touch of 'Gramin' again.  Whenever I am here by default I order the Bhindi Rajasthani. Its crispy fried Lady finger with salt and chillipowder sprinkled over it. Its hands down yumm! Other starters I would recommend are Aloo Chatpata and Lasooni paneer dhuadaar! The later just tickles your taste buds even with the sound of it :) For the mains let me first talk about the rotis and daal. They are so very well done. The rotis let it be anything from Missi roti to methi roti to garlic kulcha; they are perfectly made! And the daal fry... Daal ho toh aisi ho warna na ho! In Veggies honestly I try something different everytime and I have liked all of it.   Its definitely a must go place. And not too heavy on your pockets as well!
5.0,"Gramin serves great Delhi food . Im a vegetarian and i think they have wide variety at one place ..Starters are crisp and tastier ( esp the hara bhara kabab ) .Main course has many subzies which can go along rotis . I would like to qoute those who are roti lovers they should try basket of rotis which is just right for two people . Gramin biryani is good and handi biryani is spicey .. Those who are not so comfortable with spicy stuff can try gramin biryani .The coolers are a hit especially butter milk ,kesar lassi ,thandai and mango panna .  The service is good but they need to be more attentive even after the food is served for any further repeats or a fresh order as we had to wait for a while to locate our waiter for the same.  The prices of all the items are reasonable.   Overall if you are around Koramangala and want to taste some good veg stuff, this is the place!! Bhanwar Gupta"
4.0,"Lemme just start off by saying that hari patti is not really my idea of food. But Gramin really made me consider being a vegan(and idea that faded off, thankfully) Gramin is perfect for college-going crowd who depend on pocket-money. The food is delicious, the ambience with the handicrafts and puppets decor makes you forget you're in Bangalore and transports you to some far-off village in the middle of nowhere .. The copper glasses, jumbo-sized thalis, bamboo-covered menu and waiters dressed up in authentic Indian clothing further add to the look. My first time at Gramin was during my own birthday treat. Bhindi Rajasthani for starters, Nimbu Shikanji for Chillers and varieties in Indian breads and subjis (all yummy) left everybody happy and impressed. The biggest shocker was the bill which was about Rs. 400 for a gang of 4 :) :) (I guess that one would vary according to varying appetites) An evening well-spent and many more such evenings have followed. It is advisable to occupy a table on the 1st floor(the view of the busy road on the ground floor kinda nullifies the restaurant ambiance.) The place is overcrowded during afternoons all week. So better come early or reserve a table in advance, else it's gonna be a long wait. Bon appetite to those of planning on trying out Gramin :) :)"
5.0,"One of the best places in Bangalore for authentic Indian vegetarian food. The place is small so book your reservations before you leave home,but once you reach there you wouldn't wanna step outta it. Try the nimbu-pani and the Hara-Bhara kabab without fail.  One could always try their Thali which is filling,priced very reasonably too.  You also have a discount on take away so you could consider that as well.."
